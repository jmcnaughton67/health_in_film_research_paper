Pongo and Perdita have a litter of 15 puppies. Cruella De Vil takes a fancy to the pups, and wants to get hold of them, as well as more pups, to make herself a lovely Dalmatian skin coat.

Later the puppies are stolen by Anita's hateful classmate, Cruella De Vil who is planning to make fur coats from their skin. Pongo and Perdita race to save their puppies from the clutches of Cruella and her henchmen.—Andrew Wilson A dalmatian named Pongo falls in love with a beautiful Dalmatian named Perdita and begin a family shorty after their owners marry. However, when their 15 puppies are kidnapped by two thieves hired by the greedy Cruella De Vil, who plans to make a fur coat with their skin with other puppies, Pongo and Perdita have to rescue them before it's late. Pongo is a male Dalmatian living in London with his master, Roger, a bachelor songwriter who has yet to sell his first tune. Bored with their single existence, Pongo arranges for Roger to meet Anita, a pretty young woman who just happens to have a female Dalmatian named Perdita. It is not long before love blossoms all around and a double wedding takes place. A few months later, Perdita gives birth to 15 puppies, much to the delight of Cruella De Vil, a wealthy, wicked former schoolmate of Anita's whose burning passion is to own a coat made of Dalmatian pelts. When she is unable to purchase the puppies, she has them ""dognapped"" and brought to her crumbling estate in the country, where 84 other Dalmatians are also being held captive. All attempts by the police to find the missing pups fail, and the desperate Pongo and Perdita appeal to the dogs of London, via the ""twilight bark."" Led by The Colonel, an indomitable shaggy dog and a cat named Sergeant Tibbs, all dogdom comes to the rescue and, aided by geese, cows, and horses, tracks down the missing puppies.—alfiehitchie In 1950's London, England, we are introduced to a dalmatian dog named Pongo, and his 'pet' (owner), Roger (note: dogs in this film refer to their owners as 'pets,' much the way humans refer to dogs the same way). Roger is a brooding musician, who seems to have no problems with the life of a bachelor. Pongo, however, wants more out of life. Viewing dogs and their owners going by, Pongo spies Perdita, a female dalmatian, and her 'pet,' Anita.Pongo tricks Roger into going to the park earlier than normal, and through a rather wet incident, ends up allow Roger and Anita to meet. Sometime afterward, the two are wed and move in together, hiring a housekeeper to help with the housework. Pongo and Perdita are also eagerly expecting puppies, when Anita's old schoolfriend Cruella De Vil comes to call. Cruella has come to see the puppies, only they are not due for several more weeks. Cruella asks Anita to keep her informed when they arrive, and leaves. Roger afterwards, decides that Cruella's name would be the perfect thing to use in his new song, and playfully sings it much to Anita's discontent. Pongo meanwhile, tries to assure Perdita, who is now sad over their having puppies.The puppies eventually arrive, with Perdita delivering a litter of 15 puppies. Cruella shows up shortly afterwards, offering to buy them all. However, Roger interjects, deciding not to sell them, causing Cruella to storm off, angered at this news.Time passes, and the puppies grow bigger, and gain their spots. One evening, while Roger and Anita take their dogs for a walk, a pair of bandits named Horace and Jasper break into their house, and steal the puppies.The Police and Scotland Yard are unable to find any clues to the abduction. Roger suspects Cruella, but nothing is turned up at her home. Pongo suggests to Perdita to use the 'Twilight Bark' to spread the word to look for their puppies, though known moreso as a gossip chain. That night, while on their usual walk in Primrose Hill, Pongo sends the message to Danny the Great Dane and his terrier friend at Hampstead, whom they use Pongo's message to forward the Dalmatians' request for help to all the dogs throughout England. In the town of Suffolk, despite Lucy the Goose's doubts, Old Towser the bloodhound passes the message on to an old farm, where a group of animals are alerted: an old dog named 'Colonel,' a cat named 'Sergeant Tibbs,' and a horse named 'Captain.' Tibbs explains that he heard dogs barking at the abandoned 'DeVille place' nearby. After Captain the Horse notices smoke coming from the chimney, Tibbs is sent to investigate.Inside the supposedly-abandoned mansion, he finds a number of puppies in the main hall. One of the puppies explains to Tibbs that there's 99 of them altogether. Tibbs notices a small group with collars watching a nearby TV. Realizing they number 15, he surmises they are the missing puppies. However, Tibbs is noticed by Horace and Jasper, who attempt to kill him.Tibbs relays what he knows to the Colonel, and the 'Twilight Bark' travels back to London, where Pongo and Perdita are alerted. After sneaking out of Roger and Anita's house, they meet Danny, who gives them directions to head towards Suffolk. The two then set off across the cold, snowy countryside.Back in Suffolk, Tibbs and the Colonel observe a car heading toward the house. Tibbs goes in to investigate, and finds Cruella demanding Horace and Jasper skin the puppies immediately for a dog-skin coat, as the police are looking everywhere now. When it seems the henchman are not going to act immediately, Cruella storms off, promising that if the dogs aren't skinned by morning, she'll call the police on them. Once she leaves, Jasper tells Horace they'll watch the rest of their television program before getting to work.With this 'ultimatum,' Tibbs sneaks the puppies out of the room. However, once the program ends, the two crooks find the puppies missing, and chase them through the old mansion. Just then, Pongo and Perdita arrive in the mansion, and distract the two crooks long enough for the puppies to escape to the shed where Captain, the Colonel and Tibbs live.In the aftermath, Pongo and Perdita are surprised by the number of puppies, as well as Cruella's plan to make dog-skin coats. Pongo decides that 84 extra puppies will go with them, as they head back to London.The family makes their way across the snow countryside, eventually hiding out in an old dairy barn, thanks to a Collie who had heard of their plight by the 'twilight bark.' The Collie informs Pongo that the family should head toward Hensford, where a Labrador will be waiting for them.After spending the night in the barn, they head towards Hensford, where the Labrador explains that a moving truck in the area is heading for London, and they can all sneak aboard. However, just after they arrive, Cruella and the crooks arrive, certain the dogs are in the town.Watching two puppies playing in some soot, Pongo decides that they'll all roll in the soot, making them look like Labradors. The ruse seems to work and almost all the dogs are in the truck, until one puppy gets covered with snow, emerging un-sooted. Pongo manages to get the last puppy on the truck before it starts up, and Cruella and the crooks give chase.Cruella violently tries to force the truck off the road, but ends up going down a ravine. Forcing the car up the other side, much of it is broken apart as she fiercely tries to stop the truck, eventually getting caught in it's bumper. Careening behind the truck, trying to get it to flip over, Cruella's plans are thwarted when Horace and Jasper collide with her destroying both her car and their van, ending the chase.Back in London, as Roger and Anita prepare for Christmas, everyone laments the loss of their pets. However, with a knock on the front door, Pongo, Perdita and all 99 puppies enter. Roger is overjoyed, and much to Anita's worry, decides to keep them all, with plans to move to the country, and start a Dalmatian Plantation."
West Side Story,1961,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0055614/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Two youngsters from rival New York City gangs fall in love, but tensions between their respective friends build toward tragedy. West Side Story is the award-winning adaptation of the classic romantic tragedy ""Romeo and Juliet"". The feuding families become two warring New York City gangs--the white Jets led by Riff and the Latino Sharks, led by Bernardo. Their hatred escalates to a point where neither can coexist with any form of understanding. But when Riff's best friend (and former Jet) Tony and Bernardo's younger sister Maria meet at a dance, no one can do anything to stop their love. Maria and Tony begin meeting in secret, planning to run away. Then the Sharks and Jets plan a rumble under the highway--whoever wins gains control of the streets. Maria sends Tony to stop it, hoping it can end the violence. It goes terribly wrong, and before the lovers know what's happened, tragedy strikes and doesn't stop until the climactic and heartbreaking ending.—Anonymous On the west side of New York City, the Jets and the Sharks are Polish and Puerto Rican gangs respectively who hate each other and who battle each other for territory in their neighborhood. Their feud makes a small connection when at a gymnasium dance, Tony, one of the founders of the Jets but who is now inactive in the gang, and Maria, the recently arrived sister of the Sharks' leader Bernardo, spot each other across the crowded room and fall in love at first sight. For many of the male gang members, that connection is the last straw in their feud that leads to the decision to have a rumble to determine territory once and for all. Conversely, Anita, Bernardo's girlfriend, supports Maria's decision to romance whomever she wants, even a Jet. However, even Anita may be able to endure so much in her stance to support true love. As Maria and Tony try to meet each other clandestinely at any opportunity, Maria makes a request of him to foster peace between the Jets and Sharks, which inadvertently leads to a series of tragic events not only for the collective but personally for Maria and Tony.—Huggo Westside story is a modern musical representation of the classic story ""Romeo and Juliet"". The sharks and the jets are rival gangs fighting for the same territory. Tensions rise as a shark girl named Maria and a Jet named Tony fall for eachother, but there's a problem they can never be allowed to be together. The sharks are Puerto Rican immigrants. A rumble is planned and Maria pleades with Tony to stop it. Will he try? Or will he run away from the impossible task? The rumble goes horribly wrong and tensions are at the breaking point, will the fighting stop or will the jets get rid of the sharks once and for all? On a hot late-1950s summer in New York's Upper West Side,William Shakespeare's timeless story ofRomeo and Juliet (1968)comes to life, as a fierce enmity between two antagonistic street gangs paves the way for heartbreak and tragedy. Once more, the clan of the Montagues are at odds with the Capulets. This time, Riff's gang of rebellious second-generation New Yorkers, the Jets, and Bernardo's brass gang of Puerto Rican immigrants, the Sharks, fight over the control of the neighbourhood. Under those volatile circumstances, a climactic rumble is unavoidable; however, not before Tony, a former Jet, and Maria, Bernardo's little sister, fall head over heels in love with each other. Now, there's no turning back--and in a classic Shakespearean fashion--there can be no easy way out. Just this once, can there be a happy ending?—Nick Riganas A fight set to music between an American gang, the Jets, and a rival gang, the Sharks, who have moved into the Jets' territory from Puerto Rico. We are introduced to the leader of the Jets, Riff (Russ Tamblyn), and the leader of the Sharks, Bernardo (George Chakiris). The Sharks start the fight when they jump Baby John, one of the most developed characters.
The police arrive, led by Lieutenant Schrank (Simon Oakland) and Officer Krumpke (William Bramley), and demands that the gang disperse.When they are alone, the Jets begin to discuss what they will do about the Sharks. Riff declares that they will end the conflict on their terms by challenging the Sharks to one last all out fight, or ""rumble"". they deliver the challenge to the Sharks at the dance being held that night at the local gym, which is considered neutral territory. Action (Tony Mordente) asks to be Riff's lieutenant for the challenge and council, but the Jets leader insists on using Tony (Richard Beymer), Riff's best friend, and co-founder of the Jets. Tony has since begun to drift away from the gang, and the Jets think he doesn't belong any more. Riff tells them firmly that once you're a Jet, you stay a Jet and reassures them of their invincibility before going off to find his friend (""Jet Song""). Riff meets Tony, who now has a job at a local store run by a man named Doc (Ned Glass), and tries to persuade him to come to the dance at the gym that night. Having no real interest in the Jets' conflict with the Sharks, Tony initially refuses and tries to explain to Riff that lately he expects something very important will be coming into his life, but later reconsiders out of loyalty, when he thinks about what might happen there (""Something's Coming"").We are then introduced to Bernardo's sister, Maria (Natalie Wood). She is complaining to Bernardo's feisty ladyfriend, Anita (Rita Moreno), that she never gets to do anything exciting. Bernardo arrives and takes her to the dance, where she meets some friends, Rosalia and Consuelo. Bernardo meets up with his friends. The Jets meet, and a dance montage takes place (""Dance At The Gym""). Glad Hand (John Astin), the chaperon at the dance, tries to make the gangs mix with a get-together dance, but when he is not looking, the boys swap back to their original partners.In the midst of all the excitement, Tony and Maria see each other, and immediately fall in love. They begin to dance, but are interrupted by Bernardo, who angrily orders Maria home, and tells Tony to stay away from his sister. Tony leaves in a happy daze (""Maria"") while Riff invites Bernardo to the ""war council"", for which they agree to meet at Doc's Candy Store.Back at the Sharks' tenement building, Anita defends Maria's right to dance with whom she pleases, as do the other girls, but Bernardo will not listen. A bitter argument ensues, in which it emerges that the girls love their life in America while the boys hate it (""America"").Tony visits Maria at her tenement block, mirroring the balcony scene in Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, and they confirm their love (""Tonight""). They arrange to meet the next day at Madame Lucia's bridal shop, when Maria has finished her work. The same night, after the dance, the Jets and Sharks meet to decide where their planned rumble will take place. Before the Sharks arrive, the Jets, accompanied by Anybodys (Susan Oakes), a tomboy who desperately wants to be one of them, are visited by Officer Krupke, who warns them not to cause trouble on his beat. When he leaves, they lampoon him, along with judges, psychiatrists and social workers (""Gee, Officer Krupke""). Tony bursts in while the Jets and Sharks are in conference, and demands that they have a fair fist fight instead of a rumble. Riff agrees, and Bernardo reluctantly accepts.The next day, Maria and her friends are working at the bridal shop, and Maria is in an unusually happy mood. The other girls wonder what has come over her, and Maria explains (""I Feel Pretty""). Tony arrives. Everyone except Maria and Anita has left. Anita likes the couple, but is clearly afraid of what might happen if Bernardo knows they are seeing each other. She demands that Maria be home soon, then goes home to pretty herself up -- she and Bernardo have arranged to have a little quality time after the Rumble. Maria demands that Tony stop the fight altogether, but before Tony leaves, they pretend that the bridal clothes in the shop are for them, and imagine their engagement and wedding (""One Hand, One Heart"").Next is a musical montage showing everyone's respective feelings. The Jets and Sharks are ready in case the fight becomes a rumble after all, Tony and Maria are looking forward to seeing each other that night, and Anita is getting ready for her date with Bernardo (""Quintet"").The fight, which is between Bernardo and Ice (Tucker Smith), Riff's second in command, is about to begin when Tony appears. When Tony tries to stop the fight, Bernardo attacks him. When Tony does not retaliate, the Sharks mock him. Unable to stand by and watch while his best friend is mocked and humiliated, Riff punches Bernardo, trying to defend Tony, and the two gang leaders draw their switchblades (""The Rumble""). Tony tries to stop Riff, but Ice and Tiger hold him back. In the midst of the fight, Bernardo kills Riff. Before the stunned members of both gangs can react, Tony, enraged at the murder of his best friend, picks up Riff's blade and stabs Bernardo, killing him instantly. This sets off a free-for-all amidst the gang members. As police sirens start blaring in the distance, everybody takes off, leaving behind the bodies of Riff and Bernardo.Blissfully unaware of what has happened, Maria is waiting for Tony on the tenement roof. She is still in a gay mood, and dances around the roof, until another Shark, Chino (Jose De Vega), who loves her, appears, worn out from the fight. Without thinking, Maria demands to know what has happened to Tony, betraying her feelings. Angered, Chino tells Maria that Tony killed her brother, then leaves. Tony arrives as Maria prays that Bernardo is not dead; realizing that it's true, Maria lashes out at Tony, who can only tell her what happened, and asks her to forgive him before he goes to the police. Maria finds that in spite of everything, she still loves Tony and begs him to stay with her. They reaffirm their love (""Somewhere"").Ice has taken over as leader of the Jets. He tells them they will have their revenge on the Sharks, but must do it carefully (""Cool""). Anybodys appears from infiltrating the Sharks' turf and warns the Jets that Chino is now after Tony with a gun. The Jets scatter out to find Tony, including Anybodys, whose deed officially makes her a Jet.Back at the flat, Tony and Maria are sleeping together. Anita arrives. Maria and Tony make whispered arrangements to meet at Doc's and run away together. Anita comes in, sees Tony running away (and being informed of Chino by Anybodys), and chides Maria for loving him (""A Boy Like That""). Maria will not listen, and Anita looks as though she has to restrain herself from hitting her. But Maria's heartfelt love (""I Have A Love"") wins over Anita, for she remembers she felt the same way about Bernardo. Anita then tells Maria about Chino searching for Tony with a gun.Lieutenant Schrank arrives and questions Maria about the events leading up to the Rumble. He knows about the argument, and Maria lies that the boy she danced with was another Puerto Rican. She sends Anita to Doc's on the pretense that she is sending her to fetch a medicine for her headache -- she asks Anita to say she has been detained, explaining she would have gone herself otherwise. Anita's real purpose is to tell Tony (who has now taken refuge in the cellar of Doc's drugstore) that Maria is detained from meeting him.But when Anita enters Doc's, the Jets maul her, simulating a gang rape. In black anger, Anita delivers the wrong message -- she says Maria is dead, shot by Chino for loving Tony. When Doc breaks the news to Tony, he leaves the shop in despair. Tony then runs through the streets shouting for Chino and begging him to kill him too.Wandering onto the playground, he sees Maria, at first thinking that it is only in his mind, then realizing it really is her, but as they run towards each other, Chino appears out of nowhere and shoots Tony. As the Jets and Sharks appear, Maria and Tony reaffirm their love (""Somewhere""), but Tony dies in her arms. Maria takes the gun from Chino and accuses everybody in sight of the deaths of Tony, Bernardo, and Riff. The police and gang members arrive. When they see Tony dead, some of the Jets lift him, and the Sharks join them, while Chino is taken away by the police. As in Romeo and Juliet, tragedy has brought the feuding between the two gangs to an end.Romeo and Juliet equivalentsTony=Romeo, Maria=Juliet, Bernardo=Tybalt, Riff=Mercutio, Doc=Friar Lawrence, Chino=Paris, Anita=Nurse,"
The Guns of Navarone,1961,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0054953/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A team of Allied saboteurs are assigned an impossible mission: infiltrate an impregnable Nazi-held Greek island and destroy the two enormous long-range field guns that prevent the rescue of 2,000 trapped British soldiers. In 1943, the British Navy is not able to rescue 2,000 soldiers trapped in the Island of Kheros since two powerful German cannons on the top of the Navarone Island are sinking the Allied vessels. After a failed aerial attack, the Allied command decide to send a six-man team disguised as fishermen to Navarone to blow-up the guns. The squad is commanded by Maj. Roy Franklin and composed by Capt. Keith Mallory, who is an experienced mountain climber, and his former partner Col. Andrea Stavros; the explosive expert Cpl. John Anthony Miller; the engineer CPO 'Butcher' Brown; and the Greek assassin Spyros Pappadimos, who was born in Navarone. They sail during the night and after an encounter with a German patrol boat and a storm in the sea, they arrive to Navarone and Capt. Mallory needs to climb a cliff face during a heavy rainy night to proceed their mission. Will they succeed?—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Two powerful German guns control the seas past the Greek island of Navarone making the evacuation of endangered British troops on a neighboring island impossible. Air attack is useless so a team of six Allied and Greek soldiers is put ashore to meet up with partisans to try and dynamite the guns. The mission is perilous enough anyway, but are the Germans on the island getting further help too?—Jeremy Perkins {J-26} 1943. With the battle of Stalingrad turning the war against them, the Germans are attempting to bully neutral Turkey into joining the Axis. To this end, they have trapped two thousand British soldiers on Kiros, an island in the Aegean, with only one sea route for evacuation, a sea route commanded by two gigantic German antiship batteries deployed in a massive cliffside bunker on the island of Navarone. Immune to air attack and too much for Allied battleships to suppress, the British muster Keith Mallory, a commando officer who has been working on occupied Crete for nearly two years and who is an expert mountaineer, to ferry a team of British commandos to the only area of Navarone that is not monitored by the Germans, a four hundred-foot cliff. Greek resistance is to meet the team inland and guide them around German patrols to the area of the German guns. However, the commanding officer of the British team suffers grave injury in the climb and Mallory must take control of the mission, despite clashes with explosives expert John Anthony Miller, who upon the arrival of the night of the raid finds his equipment has been sabotaged, thus exposing a traitor in the team's ranks.—Michael Daly The year is 1943, and 2000 British soldiers are holed up on the island of Keros in the Aegean. Rescue by the Royal Navy is impossible because of massive guns on the nearby island of Navarone. Time is short, because the Germans are expected to launch an assault on the British forces, to draw Turkey into the war on the Axis' side.Efforts to blast the guns by air have proven fruitless, so a team has been hastily assembled to sail to Navarone and blow up the guns. Led by Major Roy Franklin (Anthony Quayle), they are Capt. Keith Mallory (Gregory Peck); Andrea Stavros (Anthony Quinn), a Colonel in the defeated Greek army; Corporal Miller (David Niven), an explosives expert; Greek-American street tough Spyros Pappadimos (James Darren); and ""Butcher"" Brown (Stanley Baker), an engineer and expert knife fighter.Disguised as Greek fishermen on a decrepit boat, they sail across the Aegean Sea. They are intercepted by a German boat and boarded. On Mallory's signal, they attack and kill all the Germans and blow up the patrol boat. Afterwards, Mallory confides to Franklin that Stavros has sworn to kill him after the war, because he was inadvertently responsible for the deaths of Stavros' wife and children.Their landing on the coast that night is hampered by a violent storm. The ship is wrecked and they lose part of their equipment, most notably the food and medical supplies. Franklin is badly injured while scaling the cliff, the injury later becoming infected with gangrene. They find that the cliff is in fact guarded after all. Miller, a friend of Franklin, suggests that they leave Franklin to be ""well cared for"" by the enemy. Mallory, who assumes command of the mission, feels that Franklin would be forced to reveal their plans, so he orders two men to carry the injured man on a stretcher.After Franklin tries to commit suicide, Mallory lies to him, saying that their mission has been ""scrubbed"" and that a major naval attack will be mounted on Navarone. Attacked by German soldiers, they split up, leaving Andrea behind with his sniper rifle, while they move on to their next rendezvous point. They contact local resistance workers, Spyros's sister Maria (Irene Papas) and her friend Anna (Gia Scala), who was supposedly rendered mute by the trauma of the Germans' torture.After meeting up with Maria and Anna, the team's mission is continually dogged by Germans, eventually being captured by Lieutenant Muesel (Walter Gotell) when they try to find a doctor for Franklin. Muesel and later Captain Sessler (George Mikell) of the SS fail to persuade the commandos to tell them where Miller's explosives are. Stavros pretends to betray the others and instead attacks the Germans, allowing the group to overpower their captors.They take the Germans' uniforms and escape, but leave Franklin behind so he can get medical attention. Franklin is injected with the truth drug scopolamine by Sessler and gives up the false ""information"", as Mallory had hoped. As a result, German units are deployed away from the guns and in the direction of the supposed ""invasion"" point.While making final preparations, Miller discovers that most of his explosives have been sabotaged and deduces that Anna is the saboteur. Not only is she the saboteur, but she can speak, and was never tortured by the Nazis; instead, she agreed to become an informer in exchange for her release. She pleads that she was coerced by the Germans into treachery, but while Mallory and Miller argue over her fate, complicated by Mallory's feelings for Anna, Maria shoots her dead. The team splits up. Mallory and Miller go for the guns, while Stavros and Pappadimos are to create a distraction in the city; Maria and Brown are assigned to steal a boat for their escape.Mallory and Miller make their way into the heavily fortified gun emplacements. Locking the main entrance behind them -- which sets off an alarm alerting the Germans to their presence -- Mallory and Miller set obvious explosives on the guns and hide more below an elevator leading to the guns. The Germans finally cut through the thick emplacement doors, but Mallory and Miller make their escape by diving into the sea. Despite Miller's inability to swim, they make it to the stolen boat, but learn that Pappadimos and Brown have been killed. Stavros is wounded and has difficulty swimming, but Mallory manages to pull him in.The destroyers appear on schedule. The Germans remove the explosives planted on the guns and fire. The first salvo falls short. The second brackets the lead ship. However, just as the guns are prepared to fire again, the elevator descends low enough to trigger the hidden explosives. The guns and fortifications are destroyed in a spectacular explosion. Franklin hears it from his hospital bed and smiles.Stavros, who has fallen in love with Maria, decides to return to Navarone with her and shakes hands with Mallory, having given up his planned vengeance."

Come September,1961,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0054759/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Younger generation vs. ""older"" folks on vacation at an Italian villa. Wealthy industrialist Robert Talbot arrives early for his annual vacation at his luxurious Italian villa to find three problems lying in wait for him. Firstly, his long-time girlfriend Lisa Fellini has given up waiting for him to pop the question and has decided to marry another man. Secondly, the major domo of his villa, Maurice Clavell, has turned the estate into a posh hotel to make some easy money while the boss isn't around. And, finally, the current guests of the ""hotel"" are a group of young American girls trying to fend off a gang of oversexed boys, led by Tony, who are 'laying siege' at the outer walls of the villa. Talbot, to his own surprise, finds himself becoming an overprotective chaperone.—Alfred Jingle The wealthy American executive Robert Talbot comes to Italy in a business trip and anticipates his annual vacation a couple of months before the usual month of September. He invites his Italian girlfriend Lisa Helena Fellini, who had decided to get married with her British fiancé Spencer, to go with him to his villa and she immediately calls off her engagement with Spencer. When Robert arrives in his villa with Lisa, he learns that his butler Maurice Clavell has been using his property as a hotel for six years while Robert is in the United States. Further, the ""hotel"" is booked with six female teenage students that are controlled by the tough Margaret Allison. Robert fires Maurice and asks him to send the tourists away. However, Margaret slips on a champagne cork and the girls are forced to stay a little longer. When four American male students arrive in Robert's villa, they flirt with the girls. However Robert protects them and advises one of them, Sandy Stevens, telling that easy women do not get married since men do not take them seriously. Sandy tells Lisa what Robert told her and Lisa changes her behavior and leaves Robert alone.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Wealthy New York based businessman Robert Talbot owns a villa in Italy where he has spent every September since the war with his Italian girlfriend, Lisa Fellini. But the people associated with the villa feel Robert has taken them for granted. Lisa would really like to marry Robert, but he seems content to continue with these annual month long trysts, as he has never even broached the subject of marrying her. As such, she has accepted the marriage proposal of a staid Brit named Spencer, which she plans to tell Robert on his next September visit simply by being a newly married woman. And his villa servants, led by his majordomo, Maurice Clavell, believe he thinks the villa is up kept by magic. What they have done for the past six years without his knowledge is to open up the villa as a four star hotel for the eleven months he isn't there, using the money to make improvements to the villa, and pocketing the rest. Complications ensue when Robert unexpectedly comes to Italy in July for a business trip, which catches both Lisa and Maurice by surprise. Although Robert does find out about the hotel, it is more difficult both to fire Maurice and the servants, and get rid of the current guests than he would like, those guests which include Margaret Allison and her six American charges. Margaret, with who Maurice is mutually smitten as she is under the impression that he owns the hotel, has regularly chaperoned a group of American teenaged girls to Italy. And Lisa decides to spend this one last year with Robert before getting married to and without telling him about Spencer. Out of this situation erupts a battle of the sexes and of the generations as Robert, while Margaret is incapacitated and while they are all on his property, feels he needs to protect the girls, especially from a group of four brash American college boys who have also come to stay, he telling the girls one thing while dealing with Lisa in a whole different manner. And the boys feel they need to use their youth to outlast Robert in his games of protecting the girls from them.—Huggo"
Flower Drum Song,1961,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0054885/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A young woman arrives in San Francisco's Chinatown from Hong Kong with the intention of marrying a rakish nightclub owner, unaware he is involved with one of his singers. Chinese stowaway Mei Li (Miyoshi Umeki) arrives in San Francisco with her father to meet her fiancé, wealthy nightclub owner Sammy Fong (Jack Soo), in an arranged marriage, but the groom has his eye on his star singer Linda Low (Nancy Kwan). This film version of the Rodgers and Hammerstein Broadway musical is filled with memorable song-and-dance numbers showcasing the contrast between Mei Li's traditional family and her growing fascination with American culture.—alfiehitchie A romantic story set in San Francisco's Chinatown where Mei & her father, 2 stowaways from China. arrive to meet her fiancé; nightclub owner Sammy Fong (Jack Soo). But he has his eys on Linda Lo (Nancy Kwan), the singer and star of his club's show.—Huggo During the potpourri overture and opening credits, oriental figures portray a journey from Hong Kong to San Francisco aboard a cargo ship.
When the action begins a young Chinese girl, Mei Li, and her father, Dr. Han Li, peer out a porthole in the ship as they sail into San Francisco harbor. They have stowed away in crates in the cargo hold of the ship. Later after the cargo has been unloaded onto the dock, Mei Li and her father climb out of their crates and wander the streets of San Francisco Mei Li thinks it is a wonderful city and must be a holy place since its named for a saint.
They wander into a park, where they ask several people for help to find the address of Madam Fong who has chosen Mei Li as the bride for her son, Sammy. Even though most of the people in the park are Orientals, none of them can read Chinese. The newly arrived illegal immigrants have no money, so Mei Li proposes that she and her father give a show. She will sing a song with the flower drum: ""A Hundred Million Miracles."" The lyrics sing about miracles occurring every day. During this rendition, she sings about the miracle of changing weather. The gathered crowd rewards their performance with money, but as they are collecting it a policeman asks if they have a license. After explaining that they are looking for the address of Sammy Fong, the policeman escorts them to Sammy's nightclub, the Celestial Gardens.
Linda Low and several Celestial Gardens chorus girls perform ""Fan Tan Fannie"" as the floorshow. During the number Dr. Li, Mei Li and the policeman enter. The policeman asks to speak to Sammy. When this totally assimilated hipster arrives, he tells the officer that these are the folks he has been looking for and recognizes a photo of Mei Li that his mother had shown him. Sammy's mother is insisting on his union with a traditional Chinese girl in an arranged marriage. In the club's kitchen, Sammy feeds the starving immigrants. Mei Li likes American cooking, but Sammy is insulted; he contends his club serves the best Chinese cooking in the bay area. Dr. Li asks Sammy if he intends to honor his marriage proposal. Linda, Sammy's long-time girlfriend, comes into the room just in time to overhear this question. She furiously stalks out of the room. Sammy goes after her and promises Linda he'll unload the Chinese bride the next day. If Linda will understand, he promises to buy her a new convertible.
The following day Sammy visits Madam Liang, the sister-in-law of Master Wang, who wants a traditional bride for his son, Wang Ta. Later, Wang Ta describes himself as half American, half Chinese. He is Americanized enough to want to choose his own wife, which is a break with his Chinese heritage. Sammy tells Madam Liang about Mei Li and asks her to show the girl's photograph to her brother-in-law, which she agrees to do.
When Madam Liang presents Mei Li's photograph to Master Wang, he is delighted with the girl. Master Wang is very traditional and has been vainly attempting to keep two sons from being seduced by the American life-style. These two elderly Orientals sing ""The Other Generation,"" a song about the gulf between first generation Chinese immigrants and their offspring.
Master Wang's youngest son, Wang San, is entirely Americanized. Wearing a baseball uniform, Wang San sings his version of ""The Other Generation"" to two smaller oriental girls. Wang San and the girls sing and dance to the song, which is about the older generation preaching to them about the old days and the way things were when they were growing up.
Wang Ta had asked his father for some money, so Wang Chi-Yang takes $100 from a chest under his bed to take to the bank to get change (Master Wang doesn't trust banks). As Master Wang is returning from the bank, openly counting his money, a man robs him. Later, Madam Liang forces her brother-in-law to open a bank account.
Shortly after this incident, Sammy arrives with Mei Li for Master Wang to inspect her. After Master Wang looks her over, she volunteers to sing a flower drum song. In this version of ""A Hundred Million Miracles,"" Mei Li sings about the miracle of making music. Master Wang is very impressed and asks Mei Li and her father to stay with him so he can present her to his son. Master Wang is persuaded by his sister-in-law to allow his son and Mei Li to fall in love naturally American style. But, Master Wang will only allow a short period of time before he intervenes.
Wang Ta is dazzled by Linda Low's charms. He telephones her and asks her for a date. She agrees to one immediately, but needs twenty minutes to get ready. As she dresses, she sings ""I Enjoy Being a Girl."" Linda loves everything about being feminine, including her curvy figure, her frilly clothes, and her silken curls. She also loves to receive flowers, to talk for hours on the telephone and even appreciates guys whistling at her when she wears a bikini, although she pretends to be offended.
Linda and Ta go for a ride in her new convertible; she tells Ta the car was given to her by her brother, but it was actually purchased by Sammy. During their excursion, Ta asks Linda to wear his fraternity pin (a symbol of going steady), which she agrees to do. She hopes her relationship with Ta will make Sammy jealous enough to propose.
When Ta sneaks into his house very late, Mei Li is still awake. She tells him she and her father are guests of his father and that she has come to this country to get married. As Ta retreats to his bedroom, he tells Mei Li, I hope you'll like it here, which the girl misinterprets as his approval of their relationship. She has no idea of his infatuation with Linda Low, so she sings ""I Am Going to Like It Here,"" as she contemplates living with Ta in the Wang household. The next morning as Mei Li delivers Master Wang's breakfast to his bedroom, she is still singing ""I Am Going to Like It Here."" She informs him that she met his eldest son the previous evening.
Helen Chao, an excellent seamstress, brings the graduation gown she has made for Ta and wants to present it to him as a gift (she is obviously in love with Ta, but he doesn't seem to think of her romantically). Ta invites Helen to the party they are having after his graduation. He also mentions that his aunt, Madam Liang, is becoming a U.S. citizen, so they will be celebrating that also. Helen volunteers to make a happy coat for Madam Liang.
Linda pressures Ta to get married. She tells him she'll bring her brother to the graduation party to settle the details.
Master Wang presents Mei Li with a beautiful American gown to wear to the party. When she models it, Ta is very impressed. Mei Li tells him that his brother, San, says he only likes American tomatoes.
At the after-graduation party, Madam Liang is presented an award as the best student in her citizenship class. In honor of the occasion, she sings ""Chop Suey,"" in which she compares living in the U.S. to the Chinese dish invented by Americans. The song is primarily a catalog of Fifties famous personalities and fads. To her, American society, like Chop Suey, is a melting pot. A dance involving many of the party guests follows. The dance too is a mixture of dance styles including a line dance, a Twenties-style Charleston, rock 'n' roll and jazz.
Linda and her Sea Captain-brother arrive at the party (actually the comic from the Celestial Gardens is posing as her brother). When Linda's brother mentions Ta's proposal of marriage to Master Wang, the elder Wang coughs (he always coughs when things don't go his way). Mei Li overhears their conversation and becomes upset, but Helen reassures her that Ta isn't really in love with Linda. Mei Li is so upset that she and her father tell Master Wang they must leave, but Master Wang talks Mei Li into giving Ta a little more time.
Sammy is also at the party and calls Linda's hand (of course, he recognizes the comic from his club). He tells her he knows she doesn't love Ta. Linda complains that she and Sammy have been together for five years and nothing has happened (meaning no permanent commitment). At the New Year's parade (held on New Year's Eve) we hear an excerpt from John Philip Sousa's ""Stars and Stripes Forever."" Linda is on one of the parade's floats. She steps off the float to sing ""Grant Avenue,"" a song about one of the principal streets in the largest Chinatown outside of Asia. She sings about the thoroughfare being a western street with eastern manners where visitors can eat shark-fin soup or bean cake fish. Deviously, Sammy invites the Wang family to his club. Master Wang doesn't want to go, but Sammy tells him if he wants to break up his son's romance with Linda, he should be there.
Before the New Year's Eve show at the Celestial Gardens, Linda asks Sammy if she can quit that evening, but Sammy talks her into staying for the big New Year's Eve crowd. He asks if Ta had ever seen her act. She tells him no, that's the reason she wants to quit.
Master Wang, Madam Liang, Ta, Mei Li and Dr. Li enter the Celestial Gardens and are seated as Sammy's guests. The club announcer, Frankie Wing, the comic who played Linda's brother at the graduation party, performs ""Gliding Through My Memory"" about all the girls he remembers. The club's show girls are all Orientals, but they portray girls from Ireland, Sweden, England, Spain, France, etc. as Frankie sings. The last lines of the song sing about none of these girls comparing with the girl right here and Linda comes out to perform a fan dance (a mock strip tease; in the original stage version it was more of an actual strip number). When Ta sees Linda's performance, he is shocked. Meanwhile, Sammy is smiling because everything is going as he planned. Towards the end of her dance, Linda opens and closes her fans right in Master Wang's face. He coughs loudly and immediately exits the club, followed by the rest of his party. At the end of the number, Linda dumps a bucket of ice on Sammy's head.
Helen, who witnessed what transpired, follows Ta and goes with him to the Ricksha Bar to drink Tiger Bone Wine for the New Year. Early the next morning, we see Helen supporting Ta, who is drunk, as they enter her apartment. Before Ta sleeps off his drunkenness, Helen tells him that Linda has been Sammy's girl for five years. After Ta drifts off to sleep, Helen sings the very beautiful ""Love, Look Away"" about her unrequited love for Ta. Although she has cared for Ta for a long time, she begs love to leave and set her free. This musical sequence also includes a ballet-type dance that involves Ta and several other dancers. At the end of the number, she slides away from Ta's reach. The next morning, Helen has fixed breakfast for Ta. Before he wakes, Mei Li brings one of Master Wang's coats for Helen to mend. While she is there Mei Li recognizes Ta's coat draped around a kitchen chair. Mei Li jumps to conclusions and leaves horrified. Just after she leaves, Ta awakes, quickly dresses and, certain that his father will be worried, hurries away.
When Ta returns home, he apologizes to his father and tells him he was right about Linda Low. Master Wang calls Mei Li, but when she sees Ta, she runs into the garden crying. Ta follows her and tells her he wants to tell her a story. His story evolves into the song ""You Are Beautiful."" The lyrics tell about a flower boat with singing girls drifting down a stream in the Hwang Ho Valley. One of the girls was a beautiful, small, shy girl. Ta sings that Mei Li is the girl he saw, the girl he heard laugh, as the boat sailed past. He knew that she was the girl he would love some day. During the entire song, Mei Li's eyes are downcast. When the song concludes, she tells him she learned that he wanted another girl not Linda and she tells him about seeing his coat in Helen's apartment. She says her heart hurt so much that she does not love him anymore and she runs inside. A short time later, Mei Li and her father leave Master Wang's house to pursue the marriage contract between Mei Li and Sammy Fong.
Back at the club Sammy and some of his buddies are playing poker when his mother and uncle arrive. Linda bursts into the gambling room to complain about the dirty trick Sammy played on the Wang family. Sammy gets his mother and uncle to go on ahead to the family association meeting promising to meet them there soon. After they depart, Sammy tries to sooth Linda's feelings. He tells her he did her a favor and besides he and Linda belong together. And to prove it, he asks her to marry him. She immediately and enthusiastically accepts. They sing about their life of marital bliss in ""Sunday."" They are looking forward to spending lazy, lovely Sundays together. The song develops into quite a dance that includes a maid, a guest couple, a gardener, a butler on skates, a couple of Sammy's former girlfriends, a beatnik couple and a son dressed in a cowboy outfit.
At the family association meeting Dr. Li presents the contract that Madam Fong signed for her son to marry Mei Li. The association pledges that the contract will be honored. Madam Fong is ecstatic and takes Mei Li and her father to her house.
Later, Sammy goes to his mother's to tell her he has finally decided to settle down and get married. Of course, he is talking about Linda, but Madam Fong has other ideas. She has already prepared a wedding announcement for the marriage of her son, Samuel Adams Fong to Mei Li, the daughter of Dr. Han Li, former Professor of Philosophy at Peking University.
When Linda sees the announcement she is decidedly upset. Sammy tries to convince her that nothing has changed, except his mother expects him to marry Mei Li. One evening at Madam Fong's, Sammy and Mei Li are attempting to get to know each other and to find something in common. Finally, Sammy asks if she would like to see how he spends his evenings. He takes her to a gambling casino where he loses, to a bar where all the girls know him intimately, to a beatnik hangout (the song ""Like a God"" from the Broadway musical was changed into a beatnik poem for the film version). Early the following morning to further dissuade Mei Li, Sammy sings ""Don't Marry Me,"" in which he itemizes his many faults and the various reasons why he would make a lousy husband. The problem is it's too late; the contract is signed and sealed.
Before the wedding, Ta visits Mei Li, and they realize they are deeply in love with one another. They agree to try to come up with an idea that will get Mei Li out of the marriage contract.
After Wang Ta leaves, Mei Li watches an old TV western about illegal immigrants called ""wet backs.""
At the wedding ceremony, just before her marriage to Sammy is sealed, Mei Li declares that because she entered the country illegally and her back is wet, the contract is invalid. Ta volunteers to marry Mei Li and Sammy and Linda agree to make it a double wedding."

Will Rio take revenge on Dad, the ruthless one-eyed jack?—Nick Riganas In Sonora, Mexico in 1880, Rio (Marlon Brando), his partner Dad Longworth (Karl Malden) and a third man, Doc (Hank Worden), are robbing a bank.Rio sits on the counter, relaxed, gun pointing at the trapped customers, while all around him is drama and bustle. He observes a woman take off a ring and hide it in a purse. As the bandits escape with loot, he forces the woman to yield him her ring.The bandit trio escape to a nearby town, where they seek out female company, Doc and Dad in a whorehouse, Rio delicately woos an aristocratic woman, offering her the ring he has just stolen as the only precious thing he owns, a memento of his mother . . .Mexican mounted police trail the trio to the whorehouse. Doc is killed downstairs, Dad manages to slip out from his prostitutes upstairs room, steal two horses and pick up Rio, who precipitously leaves his high class girl friend, pulling the ring from her finger at the last minute.The mounted police follow and trap the bandits atop a desert hill, with one of their horses shot.Rio figures the Rurales will be ""swarming all over us inside an hour,"" and the weary horse cant carry both of them. Their only option is for one of them to ride their single horse to a little post down the canyon about five miles and return with two fresh mounts. Rio fixes the random draw so his pal Dad gets to go. Dad gets to a corral, commandeers two fresh horses practically at gunpoint, but he has second thoughts.One way back goes to the hilltop, sure to be taken by the Rurales, and in the opposite direction is a treeline behind which are the border and safety. One way lies danger and a poor chance at surviving with half the booty, the other lies a virtual certainty with all of the stolen gold. Upon brief reflection, Longworth leaves his friend to be captured by the Rurales.After Rio is captured, the posse stops at the corral to ask where Longworth might be, and Rio hears that Longworth took only one horse and sped off in a direction away from where he was waiting.After almost five years in a Mexican prison, Rio makes an escape, accompanied by Modesto (Larry Duran), a prison pal.For a time, the sole purpose of his existence is to track down Longworth. Modesto and Rio make the round of cantinas and whorehouses asking whether anyone knows of Longworths whereabouts. After drawing blanks for a while, they arrive at Reds Cantina, the establishment where Doc was shot in the beginning, and there, Dads favorite house girl remembers both Dad and Rio but says she hasnt heard anything in five years.The girls interest in talking to Rio triggers a confrontation with Bob Amory (Ben Johnson) and Harvey Johnson (Sam Gilman). Rio, frighteningly still and silent, exudes lethal menace and suppressed violence. Bob and Harvey have learned that Longworth is the sheriff Monterey in upper California, and has taken himself a Mexican wife with a teen-age daughter, and where, coincidentally, there is a potentially very lucrative bank that Bob and Harvey are hoping to hold up.After some tense exchanges, Bob and Harvey say they very much want Rios participation, and the four of them, namely Rio, Modesto, Bob and Harvey agree to travel to Monterey to hold up the bank, and by the way Rio will kill Longworth in revenge.The foursome arrive in Monterey. While three of them check into the hotel, Rio enters the sheriffs office, manned by deputy Lon (Slim Pickens), and asks to see Longworth. Lon gives out no information, answering questions by questions, frustrating Rio and creating bad blood immediately. Rio leaves the sheriffs office and has no trouble in getting directions to Longworths house, outside town by the beach.Rio calls on Longworth at his home, talking softly and in an unthreatening manner. A guilt-ridden Dad finds Rio pleasant and apparently willing to forget past differences.Longworth has become the respectable sheriff of Monterey, California, has married Maria (Katy Jurado), and treats her daughter Luisa (Pina Pellicer) as if she were his own.Longworth uses the opportunity to ""explain"" why he never returned to the hilltop, but his story is a lie that contradicts what Rio knows first hand from hearing what happened at the corral in the canyon. Rio pretends to believe him. Of his own story, he conceals the fact that he spent years in prison.Longworth feigns friendliness and affability, concealing his malice. He and Rio sit, reminiscing cordially about their pasts, while the viewer is left wondering if at any moment the two of them might blowing the others head off. Dad introduces his family, and invites Rio to stay for supper. Longworth is understandably cautious and wary, and becomes uneasy when Rio and stepdaughter Luisa appear to show a romantic interest in one another.The bank holdup had been planned for the very next morning, but Rio learns that the town is having a fiesta, so the next couple of days all businesses, including the bank, will be closed. The gang has no choice but to delay the planned holdup.That evening, the respected sheriff gives speeches, circulates among the townspeople backslapping everyone and drinking hard. During the festivities, Longworth meets Rios partners. Rio, asked to explain the poor quality of his new associates, notes there were ""slim pickings"" after Longworth left.In conversation, Rio calls Longworth ""a one-eyed jack,"" someone who displays only one side of his personality or life. Longworth now has a reputation as a straight-laced, no-nonsense lawman, but Rio says he has seen the other side of that card.The fiesta continues, Rio dances and talks with the sweet Luisa, with conflicted feelings and intentions. On the one hand he is sincerely attracted to her, on the other he is using her to get his revenge on Longworth. They dance and talk and both fall in love, and spend the whole night together. At dawn, his conscience begins to get the upper hand and he confesses that many of the things he said the previous night were lies intended to seduce her.Longworth had drunk too much to keep an eye on Luisa, despite Marias entreaties. He was taken home and Lon was left in charge of finding Luisa. But Lon was distracted, too, and failed, and is waiting at Longworths home in the early morning as Luisa returns home. Lon, who wants Luisa for himself, wakes Longworth to tell him about Luisas night escapade, enraging Longworth at the possible scandal.Maria, who is a loving and understanding mother, intercedes, and manages to calm Dad Longworth by convincing him that Luisa is truthful when she says nothing happened.The next morning, in the saloon, Rio is angered when a drunk is mistreating one of the house girls and knocks the drunk down after a warning. The drunk finds a shotgun in a rack and shoots at Rio from the back, but Modesto shouts in time for Rio to roll out of the way at the last instant and from the floor shoot the man dead.Longworth arrives and pretends to accept it was a justifiable self defense. He asks Rio to help him carry the dead man to a cart outside the saloon. As the man is deposited in the cart, deputies with long guns appear everywhere surrounding Rio, and he lifts his hands in surrender.Rio is tied to a horse rail, where Longworth first flogs him with a whip, then smashes his right hand with a rifle butt, before putting him on his horse to carry him out of town.Rio and his partners retreat to a small fishing village on the coast to regroup and recover. For some weeks Rio practices with his gun and slowly regains the use of his right hand. They grow impatient, but Rio assures them he is more than ever determined not only to rob the bank but to kill the sheriff as well.During this time, Luisa realizes she is pregnant, tells her mother, and reflects on what to do.
Luisa seeks Rio out at the fishing village to tell him she still is in love with him, that they can have a future together, but that bright future is strongly at risk if he persists in seeking revenge. Rio listens to her patiently, and assures her of his love for her, but the need to get back at Longworth is too strong, the hatred too deep, and he refuses to give up trying to kill Dad. She returns to Monterey without mentioning she is expecting a baby.Amory and Johnson have had enough waiting, give an ultimatum that its today or never, and decide to hold up the bank without Rio when Rio demurs. Bob, Harvey and Modesto leave for Monterey, but Bob and Harvey do not trust Modesto for being Rios friend, and they murder him by a cruel trick before proceeding on to Monterey. On the way to the bank, Bob stops at Longworths home to announce that Rio is coming with murderous intent, thus drawing attention away from the holdup and implicating Rio.At the bank, the holdup goes wrong after the bank teller (Elisha Cook) tricks the gunmen them by handing over one gun without revealing another gun in reserve. In the shootout, Bob and Harvey are killed, and since they were known to be Rios partners, a posse is sent to capture Rio as the mastermind.Rio meantime has decided to forgo vengeance and leave with Luisa. He is calmly riding into town when he finds himself surrounded, he gives up, and is jailed. He is at the mercy of Longworth, who wants to kill Rio to cover up his own guilt and all earlier betrayals. The volatile, treacherous, arrogant sheriff taunts Rio with the legendary words: ""You'll get a fair trial, and then I'm gonna hang you, personally.Luisa comes to the jail, and reveals that she is pregnant. Later, Luisa brings a pot of her stew to the jail, to be given to Rio as his last meal. The sadistic Lon discovers a hidden Derringer and bullets for it at the bottom of the pot, and laughs. The Derringer is left on a table many feet from the jail bars while Lon is fortuitously summoned away. Grasping his chance, Rio manages to break his bed and bed springs and concoct a lasso of sorts, successfully drags the table closer to him, and he recovers the Derringer. However he has no bullets for it.Nevertheless, Lon is a coward and Rio manages to intimidate him with the unloaded weapon. Rio gets Lon to hand over the keys, he unlocks his shackles, locks Lon up, and escapes. He breaks in to a place where he gets real weapons, and is about to flee with Luisa, when Lon from his jail cell yells out loudly enough to be heard.Longworth appears, and a shootout ensues in the center of town, with Rio dodging bullets around the central fountain. Under fire and left with no choice, he tricks Longworth and shoots him. Rio picks up Luisa and in two horses they gallop away. Longworth, dying, manages to get one last shot in the direction of the galloping horses before expiring.Outside of town, near the shore, Rio and Luisa stop to plan the near future. She will stay behind until the baby is born, he will come back for her after that time, they will get married and go on from there. They kiss goodbye, part, wave at each other, and Rio gallops away."

As Roslyn is entering the Washoe County Courthouse with her best friend and landlord Isabel (Thelma Ritter), she ignores Raymond's attempts to talk to her and reconcile. Isabelle is also a divorcee.After the divorce papers are filed, Isabelle takes Roslyn to a cocktail lounge at Harrah's Reno Hotel-Casino for drinks, to let the reality of her new divorce sink in. While at Harrah's, they meet an aging cowboy named Gaylord 'Gay' Langland (Clark Gable) and his tow truck driver best friend Guido (Eli Wallach). After some good conversation, they invite Roslyn and Isabelle to Guido's old house in the Nevada countryside to help her forget about the divorce, after Gay tells Roslyn that he is also divorced. The group arrives at the unfinished house Guido built for his late wife, who died several years earlier during childbirth. They all drink and dance. Roslyn has too much to drink, so Gay drives her home to Reno.Eventually, Roslyn and Gay move into Guido's half-finished house and start to work on it. One day after breakfast, Gay tells Roslyn how he wishes he were more of a father to his own children, whom he has not seen for some years. Later that afternoon, Roslyn and Gay argue when Gay discovers a rabbit has been eating the lettuce in the garden. Gay states his intention to find and kill the rabbits which have been eating the vegetable garden they planted outside Guido's house.When Guido and Isabelle later show up at the house, Gay suggests that they round up wild mustangs to sell. They then plan to go to a local rodeo in Dayton to look for and hire a third man for the job. In Dayton, they run into Perce Howland (Montgomery Clift), a cowboy friend of Gay's, who is in Dayton to compete in the rodeo. Gay offers to pay for the broke Perce's $10 rodeo entry fee if he helps the group round up wild mustangs the next day. Isabelle sees her ex-husband Charles and his new wife Clara, and decides to invite them to her Reno boarding house home instead of going to the rodeo with Gay, Guido, Perce, and Roslyn.

The group is nearly involved in a fist fight when a drunken patron at the bar spanks Roslyn's bottom as she plays paddle-ball.At the rodeo, Roslyn becomes somewhat upset when Guido tells her how the horses are made to buck with an irritating flank strap. She then declares that all rodeos should be banned. Later in the rodeo, Perce is thrown by a bucking horse and Roslyn begs him to go to a hospital, but he insists on riding a bull he had already signed up and paid to ride. He gets thrown again, resulting in a head injury.Later that afternoon, after Roslyn dances with Perce, he passes out in a Dayton back alley. When he regains consciousness, he sees Roslyn crying over him. He says that he never had anyone cry for him before and that he wished he had a friend to talk to.

When Gay discovers his children have already left Dayton, he causes a public scene outside the bar in Dayton.Later on, during the drive home to Reno that evening, a drunken Guido asks if Roslyn has left Gay, and offers to take his place. Back at Guido's house, Guido, intoxicated and sleepless, attempts to finish the patio he started. Perce awakens and nearly tears his bandages off, forgetting about his recent injury. Roslyn puts him to bed and sits down with Gay. He asks her if a woman like her would ever want to have a child with him. She avoids the issue, and Gay goes to bed.The next day, Gay, Guido and Perce prepare to go after the wild mustangs, and Roslyn reluctantly tags along. Guido flies his biplane into a valley and spots a group of horses which he uses his plane to chase them out of the valley and onto the plain where Gay, Perce and Roslyn are. After the men catch a stallion and four mares, Rosalyn becomes upset when she learns that the mustangs will be sold and slaughtered for dog food. She then tells Gay she did not know she was falling in love with a killer. Gay tells Roslyn that he did things for her that he never did for any other woman, such as making the house a home, and planting the garden.After the horses are captured, Roslyn begs Gay to release the horses. He considers doing it, but when she offers to pay him the $200 she won playing paddle-ball, it angers him. Guido tells Roslyn that he would let them go if she would leave Gay for him. She rebuffs him, telling him he only cares about himself. Perce also asks her if she wants him to set the horses free, but she declines because she thinks it would only start a fight.That night, Perce wakes up Roslyn and they free the stallion anyway. After Gay chases down and subdues the horse all by himself, he lets it go and says he just did not want anybody making up his mind for him. With Guido angrily yelling at Gay for letting the horses get away, Perce tries to calm him down, while Gay and Roslyn get into Gay's truck to drive back home. As they are driving, Roslyn tells Gay that she will move out the next day. Gay stops the truck to pick up his dog from Guido's parked biplane, and watches Roslyn joyfully untethering it. Gay and Roslyn realize that they still love each other, and they drive off into the night."

In times of great upheaval during Passover in early-first-century Jerusalem, the fifth governor of the Roman province of Judaea, Pontius Pilate, finds himself before a pressing dilemma. As part of a tradition, the indecisive ruler offers the agitated crowd the choice to have either Jesus of Nazareth or the murderer, Barabbas, released from Roman custody; but, instead, the people demand the release of the thief. Now, as Jesus takes Barabbas' place on the cross, an inhumane act of punishment paves the way for an arduous spiritual journey of faith, leading Barabbas to Sicily's dark sulphur mines, and the blood-soaked soil of Emperor Nero's Coliseum. Will Jesus' sacrifice set Barabbas, the slave, free?—Nick Riganas Epic account of the thief Barabbas, who was spared crucifixion when Pilate manipulated the crowd into to pardoning him, rather than Jesus.

The Innocents,1961,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0055018/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A young governess for two children becomes convinced that the house and grounds are haunted. In Victorian England, the uncle (Sir Michael Redgrave) of orphaned niece Flora (Pamela Franklin) and nephew Miles (Martin Stephens) hires Miss Giddens (Deborah Kerr) as governess to raise the children at his estate with total independence and authority. Soon after her arrival, Miss Giddens comes to believe that the spirits of the former governess Miss Jessel (Clytie Jessop) and valet Peter Quint (Peter Wyngarde) are possessing the children. Miss Giddens decides to help the children to face and exorcise the spirits.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Victorian England. Since the death of their parents, adolescents Miles (Martin Stephens) and Flora (Pamela Franklin) have been under the guardianship of their wealthy selfish uncle (Sir Michael Redgrave), who admits he has no place emotionally for them in his life. While he lives in London leading his bachelor lifestyle, the children stay at his country estate, the children under the direction of a governess, Miss Jessel (Clytie Jessop). After Miss Jessel passes away, the uncle hires a new governess, Miss Giddens (Deborah Kerr), who admits that this would be her first posting as such, and about which she is nervous. The uncle has only two directions for her: (1) take control of every aspect of Miles and Flora's life, and (2) don't bother him with anything concerning the children. She will only have to care initially for Flora as Miles is away at boarding school. Miss Giddens' first challenge ends up dealing with the news that Miles has been expelled from school for behavior corrupting the other students. Upon meeting Miles, Miss Giddens cannot understand how such a well mannered boy could be expelled, he being overly charming in an overtly mature manner. She also finds Flora to be a lovely child. As time progresses, Miss Giddens begins to feel that something is not quite right at the estate, as she sees visions of a man and a woman on the estate who she has not met and who should not be there according to the housekeeper, Mrs. Grose (Megs Jenkins). She also finds that Miles and Flora exhibit odd behavior at times, especially with each other. She ultimately comes to the conclusion that there was just cause for Miles' expulsion having to do with activities at the estate, and that she needs to bring these issues out into the open to exorcise the demons that affect Flora and most specifically Miles.—Huggo In late nineteenth century England, Miss Giddens (Deborah Kerr) becomes governess of a small orphan girl living in a lonely stately home occupied only by the child, a housekeeper, and a small complement of servants. Her initial misgivings allayed by the child's angelic nature, her anxieties are once more aroused when the girl's brother, equally captivating, is sent home from boarding school for wickedness of some unspecified kind. Eeerie apparitions and inexplicable behavior on the children's part cause her to wonder about the house's history, especially about the fate of the previous governess, Miss Jessel (Clytie Jessop), and the former valet, Peter Quint (Peter Wyngarde). She fears for the children's souls and for her own sanity. Eventually convinced that there is an unnatural force at work, perverting the innocence of her charges, she sets out to secure the children's salvation by wresting them from its power. Though her struggle reaches a resolution, its real nature and its outcome ultimately remain ambiguous. The film begins by showing a pair of clasped hands, and a woman's voice is heard, whispering that all she ever wanted was to help the children, not hurt them, and that more than anything, she loves children.In the first scene, Miss Giddens (Deborah Kerr) is applying for a job as a governess. It is her first position, but the wealthy bachelor interviewing her (Michael Redgrave) is unconcerned with her lack of experience. He values his freedom to travel and socialize and unabashedly confesses that he has ""no room, mentally or emotionally"" for his niece and nephew, who were orphaned and left in his care as infants. His previously employed governess, Miss Jessel, died suddenly less than a year ago and he is desperate to find someone else to teach the children and keep them company. He says that all he cares about is that she accepts full responsibility for the children and does not trouble him with whatever problems may arise. Miss Giddens is instantly charmed by her suave employer and promises to do her best, assuring him that she loves children above all else and that she has an ""imagination,"" making her ideal to work with children.Upon arriving at Bry, the sprawling English estate where The Uncle keeps the children, Miss Giddens hears a woman's voice calling for Flora, the little girl. Moments later, she meets Flora, and is instantly taken with the bright, quirky child. She also forges a fast friendship with Mrs. Groce (Megs Jenkins), the kindly housekeeper. The boy, Miles, is away at boarding school, though Flora delightedly insists her brother is coming home. Sure enough, Miss Giddens receives a letter saying that Miles has been expelled from school because of his bad influence on the other boys. Mrs. Groce says she can't imagine Miles being a bad influence, and when Miss Giddens meets the boy herself, she too feels sure his teachers must have exaggerated. Apart from evading all her questions about his experience at school, she finds Miles as enchanting as Flora. At first he seems polite, composed, and mature -- perhaps even too mature, with his flirtatious flattery toward the pretty Miss Giddens.While tending to the rose bushes the next day, Miss Giddens sees the shadowy figure of a man standing atop one of Bry's towers. When she climbs the stairs to investigate she finds only Miles, playing with the pigeons, who insists he saw no one.On a rainy day Miss Giddens forgoes the day's schooling to play hide-and-seek with the restless children. While searching for them, she sees a woman cross the hall in front of her and disappear. Searching the attic, she stumbles across a photograph of a darkly handsome man, and is gazing at it when Miles sneaks up on her and wrestles her playfully. Miss Giddens tells him to stop, that he is hurting her, but he doesn't stop until Flora bursts in on them and tells Miss Giddens to go hide. She goes to hide downstairs behind the curtains, and through the window she sees a man leering at her. The figure is gone by the time Mrs. Groce comes to investigate her screams. When describing the man to Mrs. Groce, Miss Giddens realizes the man in the window was the same she saw in the photograph. Mrs. Groce explains that the man in the photograph is Peter Quint, who served as valet there before he died, presumably of head trauma from tripping on the stairs outside. She mentions that Miles was intensely devoted to Quint, that he absolutely ""worshipped"" him and trailed him everywhere like a dog, much as Flora latched onto Miss Jessel.Miss Giddens is yet more disturbed when she sees a mysterious woman from across the pond. She is certain that Flora can see her as well, though the little girl evades her questions. When Miles recites a monologue invoking a ""lost lord"" to rise from the grave, Miss Giddens believes this confirms that the children are possessed, and presses Mrs. Groce for more information about Peter Quint and Miss Jessel. Mrs. Groce reluctantly tells her that the two were entangled in a perverse relationship: Quint was physically and emotionally abusive to Miss Jessel, but the more he beat and scorned her the more she seemed to adore him. They were also obscenely indiscreet with their relations, performing sexual acts in plain sight of the other servants and even the children. After Quint's fatal accident, far from being relieved by her tormentor's death, Miss Jessel went into a deep depression and, as Mrs. Groce grudgingly reveals after days of prompting from Miss Giddens, soon drowned herself in the lake where Miss Giddens believes she saw her.Miss Giddens rapidly develops her theory of the children's possession by their former caretakers. She confides to Mrs. Groce that she believes the ghosts of Quint and Miss Jessel inhabit the bodies of the children so they can carry on with their sexual acts. The behaviors she once found charming and precocious in the children she now finds suspicious and unnerving, but is determined to rescue them from this hell she is sure they are trapped in. She tells Mrs. Groce that she must go to see the children's uncle to tell him of the haunting, insisting, before Mrs. Groce can even accuse her of such motives, that this is not a subconscious trick to get the handsome uncle to notice her.However, when Miss Giddens is about to leave, she sees Miss Jessel again, sobbing. Miss Giddens changes her mind then, afraid to leave the children alone with their tormentors. That night from the dark hall she hears unearthly noises, including malicious laughter from the children. When she checks on Flora she finds her at the window, and Flora says there is someone down in the garden. It turns out to be Miles. When Miss Giddens crossly sends him to bed, he cheerfully tells her that he was out of bed because he was afraid he was becoming ""boring,"" being so well-behaved, and hoped to impress her with this small act of rebellion. Miss Giddens then finds a dead pigeon under his pillow, its neck having been snapped. Miles says he plans to bury it the next day, and before Miss Giddens leaves, he kisses her goodnight, deeply and passionately on the lips as a grown man would.The next day, Miss Giddens writes a letter to the children's uncle, and while she is writing it Flora sneaks off. Miss Giddens finds her dancing with an imaginary (or invisible) partner down by the lake. While she is asking Flora how she rowed across the lake by herself, Miss Giddens again sees the figure of Miss Jessel staring mournfully at them from across the lake. Convinced that the children will be freed from the possession if they will only admit what is happening to them and who is doing it, Miss Giddens frantically begs Flora to admit that Miss Jessel is there. Flora begins to scream and cry, calling Miss Giddens wicked and insane. Mrs. Groce comes to investigate and escorts the child to bed. Hours later, Flora is still hysterical, and when Mrs. Groce finally leaves her bedside, she says she can't imagine where Flora learned such obscenities. Mrs. Groce then says that she did not see the figure at the lake and that the children were sweet and well-behaved until Miss Giddens came. Though deeply hurt that her one ally now doubts her sanity, Miss Giddens reminds Mrs. Groce that the uncle left her in charge and orders her to take Flora away and tells the other servants to leave. She feels certain that Miles is on the brink of confessing his ordeal to her and that she must be left completely alone with him. She cannot find her letter to the uncle, and accepts that Miles must have stolen it. When Mrs. Groce asks what she is to tell their uncle, Miss Giddens responds that of course she must tell him the truth, and Mrs. Groce agrees sadly, clearly intending to tell the uncle of Miss Giddens' instability.That night when alone with Miles, Miss Giddens tries to get him to talk about the ghosts, but he is his usual glib self. She then asks again why he was expelled from school, and Miles eventually admits that he frightened the other boys with his strange outbursts of violence and vulgar language. Miss Giddens asks repeatedly who he learned this language and behavior from, tearfully promising that all she wants is to help him, that her caring nature demands her to help others ""even if it hurts them."" She soon pushes Miles too far, and he begins yelling that she is nothing but a ""hussy"" and laughs maniacally. While he is ranting, Miss Giddens sees Peter Quint's face appear in the window behind him, joining in the boy's laughter. Miles then hurls Flora's beloved pet turtle through the window and runs outside. As Miss Giddens chases him, he trips on the stairs outside and hits his head. Miss Giddens catches up to him and cradles him gently, and he whimpers humbly for her to forgive him. She tells him it's not his fault, that all he has to do is ""say his name"" and it will all be over, she alone will ""have"" him. Miles tries to run away in horror but she catches him and will not stop begging him to say the name. She sees Peter Quint appear standing on the hedge beside them, but Miles does not seem to see him and is screaming that she is insane. He finally shouts Quint's name, and the figure disappears. Miles frantically asks Miss Giddens where she saw him, and then immediately falls to the ground. Miss Giddens again cradles him and assures him that it's over, he is free. She then realizes that Miles is dead. Screaming and sobbing in horror, she then leans over him and kisses him passionately on the lips. The film ends on the image of her clasped, shaking hands, the same image it began with."

Three Daughters,1961,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0055508/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Based on popular Indian stories of the great writerRabindranath Tagore, these short films reveal definitive moments in the lives of three young girls. 'Teen Kanya' is an anthology film based upon short stories by Rabindranath Tagore, as a tribute on the author's centenary. The title means ""Three Daughters"", and the film's original Indian release contained three stories, with three central female characters linking the stories together. 'The Postmaster' concerns an orphan girl who grows attached to the postmaster she is caring for after he teaches her to read and write. 'Monihara' is a supernatural tale about a woman obsessed with the jewels her husband buys for her.

His only solace in the village is in teaching Ratan how to read and write. The second story is about a student, Amulya, who returns to his village after finishing his exams.

Last Year at Marienbad,1961,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0054632/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"In a strange and isolated chateau, a man becomes acquainted with a woman and insists that they have met before. At a weekend gathering, a man tries to convince a woman that they had met there and spent some time together the previous year. The woman has no recollection whatsoever of having met this man and is convinced that he is just making all of this up. The more the man talks about their activities the previous year however, the more convincing he becomes. The question remains however - did they meet previously or not?—garykmcd During a social meeting at a picturesque and cavernous château with high ceilings and a fine collection of artwork, ""X"", a charming and enigmatic man, approaches ""A"", a seductively distant woman, bent on convincing her that they are not strangers. As a matter of fact, ""X"" insists that they had met the year before at the Czech spa-town of Marienbad; however, the perplexed woman has no recollection of their secret romantic encounter. But, as they meander through the palatial estate's lavishly decorated rooms, the question remains: is ""X"" telling the truth? Who knows what happened last year at Marienbad?—Nick Riganas Since man first became aware of time with the passing of the seasons, the nature of time has been challenging philosophers and scientists alike. Starting with the ""flux doctrine"" of ""Heraclitus,"" according to which everything is constantly altering (""You cannot step twice in the same river""), to Henry Bergson, who was one of the first philosophers to incorporate cinema into a philosophical discourse, philosophers have wrestled with the concepts of time and memory. In literature, Marcel Proust of course comes to mind with his huge novel ""Remembrance of Things Past,"" and on the scientific side, Albert Einstein with his ""Theory of General Relativity."" Einstein posited that time is simply another dimension, which with space forms a four-dimensional space-time continuum (that was until recently, when seven more dimensions were added with the M-theory, the ""theory of everything"").Stephen Hawking distinguishes three different ""arrows of time"": thermodynamic, cosmological, and psychological (""A Brief History of Time,"" 1988). Although all of these three time arrows enter in our daily lives to a greater or lesser extent, we are here only concerned with the psychological arrow of time. Bergson, whom Proust admired, made a distinction between the concept (""clock time"") and the experience of time (""real time""), arguing that ""real time"" is experienced as ""duration"" and apprehended by ""intuition."" He further stated that time is in constant flux, with moments of the past and the present having equal reality.This leads us to Alain Resnais' film, ""L'année dernière à Marienbad"" (""Last Year at Marienbad,"" 1961), which appeared on the French screens in 1961. To say that this film shocked the film audiences is an understatement. Nobody had seen anything like it, although Resnais' ""Hiroshima mon amour"" should have prepared us by the way it explores his favorite themes: the anguish of oblivion and the fixity of time. In Resnais' film traditional realism is no longer, replaced by a deeper realism, that of the mind.For ""L'année dernière à Marienbad,"" Resnais collaborated with Alain Robbe-Grillet on the scenario. Robbe-Grillet should also be credited as co-director, as he wrote a detailed shooting script that Resnais followed faithfully, with a few exceptions. As such, some words are also in order regarding Robbe-Grillet.Alain Robbe-Grillet is a French author and literary critic. In the mid-1950s until the early 1960s, he was the theorist and leading proponent of a new movement in French literature known as ""le nouveau roman"" (the new novel). This new novel is characterized by stark descriptions which often shun allegory and metaphor in favor of precise physical details, an enhanced sense of ambiguity with respect to points of view, and an extreme disjunction of time and space. The new novel lacks the conventional elements of the traditional modes of literary realism, such as dramatic plotting, psychological analysis, and its adhesion to the unities of time and place, which creates an illusion of order, in contrast to modern life's discontinuities and randomness. Robbe-Grillet's novels are characterized by the destruction of the plot in favor of a clever construction where the protagonists no longer have any psychological dimensions, nor time and space any objective reality. They are composed largely of recurring images, impersonally depicted physical objects, and the random events of everyday life. Robbe-Grillet has written eighteen novels of various kinds and directed ten films. He was made a member of the prestigious ""Académie Française,"" in 2004. The most famous dramatization of his literary theories came to life in the present Resnais' film.The film is about the dream of a man in love with an inaccessible woman. But the dream is also a nightmare. He comes to take her away, but she does not, or does not want to, remember him. When he seems to have finally reached her, she has moved into another time, into another memory. As he renews his efforts to convince her, new nightmares arise. He is not even sure of loving her, or even if it was she who was or the object of his love. The film ends with his taking her in the nightuntil the next dream.""Marienbad"" is a love story, although not a ""story"" in the conventional narrative sense, since the fragmented images cannot be scanned chronologically. The ""story"" is not told rather it is described using a juxtaposition of physical images, through memories and associations, projected through a space-time continuum, which destroys both linear chronology and fixity. Resnais built a captivating puzzle-like film, a labyrinth, which at time resembles the optical illusions of Escher or the surreal world of Magritte.Any attempt to provide a satisfying chronology for the film would contradict the assumptions upon which it was built, as well as the manner in which it is presented. However, we can describe it. The setting is a luxurious hotel, lush with furnishings, paintings, moldings, and sculptures. There are endless formal gardens surrounding the hotel. The principal characters go only by letters, A (Delphine Seyrig), X (Giorgio Albertazzi), and M (Sasha Pitoeff). X attempts to convince A that they have met last year in this hotel (or maybe it was in a different one), that they loved each other, emotionally and physically, and that she had agreed to elope with him, away from M, her husband (or lover). At the last moment, she had refused (for whatever reason) and asked for a one year postponement. Now, the year has passed and X has come to their agreed rendezvous to take her away. A claims she does not recognize X, and cannot remember any agreement between them. At first, X is surprised, and he recounts conversations the two of them had, supporting details, relating scenes convincingly. A persists in not remembering, even though X produces a photograph of her as a proof of his claim.However, X could be mistaken about his last year's affair. If X is not mistaken, could his affair have been with another woman? A could have also had an affair with another man, ""Frank,"" whose name recurs during the film in several of the other hotel guests' conversations. As the film progresses, X is insistent, as if the strength of his conviction in recounting what he believes are actually the events themselves. At this point, facts and arguments are so mixed up that nothing is any longer verifiable. And to top it all off, at the end of the film, the lovers (A and X) run away together into the night, but this flight is recounted to us by X, in the past tense. The result is that the story can be re-started from the beginning: the whole thing took place last year, and it can be repeated ad infinitum.The woman, A, moves about the hotel in a series of stylized poses. She spends her time reading, watching a play, walking about the gardens, and having conversations with X. M hovers throughout the film, drifting from room to room, engaged in a multitude of pursuits. In particular, he gambles and plays a variation of the game of ""Nim"" with the other guests, which he claims he always wins.Surrounding these three main characters are the other personages of the film: the hotel itself, the gardens, and the other guests. The guests take walks along statuaries, hedge-mazes, fountains, and long gravel paths. Everyone appears in evening clothes to attend a dinner, a concert, or a play presented at the hotel's theater, a play that resembles the events that are unfolding in the very film we are watching. Conversations are overheard. Words float in the air as if trapped inside the hotel, in search of a listener. Time itself moves forward or backward, depending on the subject of conversations, or the mood of the people."

Domenico and Antonietta are two suburban Italian youths who meet while seeking ""a job for life"" from a big city corporation. After a bizarre screening process made up of written exams, physical agility exercises, and interview questions such as ""Do you drink to forget your troubles?"" (Domenico and Antonietta are no older than 17 or 18), they land jobs in the ""Technical Division"" and ""Typing Services"" respectively. From there, Domenico works as an underutilized errand boy until a clerk position is vacated by the death of an older employee. Domenico finally takes his place in a room of 12 other clerks with a manager overseeing them from a desk at the head of the room. The film ends as Domenico ponders his fate, from behind his tiny desk at the back of the small windowless room, listening to the sound of the mimeograph machine as it runs off carbon copies next to the manager's desk.—Alex M. Dunne <dunne_alex@jpmorgan.com> Teenaged Domenico Cantoni lives in a small apartment in Meda with his working class family consisting of his parents and his younger teenaged brother, Franco. In what is among his first major steps in the transition from being a boy to being a man in the completion of middle school, Domenic, in an effort to help support the family, is traveling into Milan as one of the invitees to apply for the many white-collar jobs within a major corporation, the process including an aptitude test. Many of the other applicants are like him in that they are young, and a job with the company would be their first work experience. Although the assumption is that the entry level jobs do not pay much, he, his family and most of the other applicants see getting one of the jobs as setting one up for life in terms of job security. As such, most of the applicants place great importance in this application day. Domenic makes a connection with one of the other applicants, Antonietta Masetti - who goes by the nickname Magali - much like him who needs a job to help support her family. Domenic hopes to have her as a friend in the city if they both get one of the jobs. They do indeed both gets jobs, but are in different sections physically and functionally within the company, and thus would not see each other on a day-to-day basis.

On his stumbling little steps towards adulthood, can Domenico find his first love as well?—Nick Riganas An Italian teen starts is journey in the big city, Milano, a dream that comes true. During the interview process he meets a girl who like, and both try to meet eachother. Slow paced movie but able to express how was that time. I don't agree at all with other plots you can find here, so I wrote mine, from an ""Italian"" prospective. I lived just there, closed to Meda, and worked in Milano. In my opinion they misunderstood everything, as it is obvious that they never lived in North Italy and cannot understand the context and the Epoch. Enjoy an Ermanno Olmi masterpiece.

Judgment at Nuremberg,1961,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0055031/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"In 1948, an American court in occupied Germany tries four Nazis judged for war crimes. It has been three years since the most important Nazi leaders had already been tried. This trial is about four judges who used their offices to conduct Nazi sterilization and cleansing policies. Retired American judge, Dan Haywood has a daunting task ahead of him. The Cold War is heating up and no one wants any more trials as Germany, and Allied governments, want to forget the past. But is that the right thing to do is the question that the tribunal must decide.—Tony Fontana <tony.fontana@spacebbs.com> It's 1948 in Nuremberg, Germany, where the American military is holding a post-WWII tribunal on the activities of individuals within the Nazi Party leading up to and during the war. Dan Haywood is the lead judge in a three-man judiciary in one of those trials, where four men, who were involved in judicial matters, are the defendants. The general issues surrounding these four is whether they are guilty of international crimes or were just carrying out the laws of their national government, especially as they did not run or operate concentration camps for example, or purportedly know about what was happening to anyone they sentenced to life at those concentration camps. Of the four on trial, the largest question mark surrounds Dr. Ernst Janning, a globally renowned judge. Haywood, not being a well traveled man outside of the US, tries to get to know life in Germany, both then and now, to get a better perspective of the discussions at the trial. He befriends a Mrs. Bertholt as that conduit into German life. The counsel for the prosecution is led by Col. Tad Lawson, who wants to win at any cost, which includes trotting out the emotional aspects of the genocide at the concentration camps at whatever opportunity, regardless of if it actually applies to the defendants. The counsel for the defense is led by Hans Rolfe, who sees the proceedings as German self-determination on trial. Problems on both sides is getting the German public affected to talk about and thus testify about this emotionally traumatizing period of their past. But another issue in the background of this trial is the current Communist aggression, most specifically in Eastern Europe, and the Americans' need for German support in quashing this aggression, support which would be difficult to obtain if the Americans are putting Germans behind bars.—Huggo In 1947, four German judges who served on the bench during the Nazi regime face a military tribunal to answer charges of crimes against humanity. Chief Justice Haywood hears evidence and testimony not only from lead defendant Ernst Janning and his defense attorney Hans Rolfe, but also from the widow of a Nazi general, an idealistic U.S. Army captain and reluctant witness Irene Wallner.—Jwelch5742 Judge Dan Haywood () arrives in Nuremberg in 1948 to preside over the trial of four Nazi judges, each charged with having abused the court system to help cleanse Germany of the politically and socially undesirable, allegedly guilty of war crimes. The opening statement of the prosecuting attorney () is a vicious one, depicting the defendants as having been willing, evil, accomplices in Nazi atrocities, but Judge Haywood wonders if it is really that simple.Confounded at how one defendant, a renowned German champion of justice named Ernst Janning (), appears to have played the greatest role in molding Germany's Ministry of Justice into a destructive instrument of Nazism, Judge Haywood resolves to gain some perspective on the period in which the German legal system strayed from a course of entirely objective justice.Probing for the truth proves difficult, though, as nobody who lived in Germany during Nazism seems to admit to having much inside knowledge. He befriends Mrs. Bertholt (), the widow of an executed Nazi army officer, but she offers few insights, more consumed by her personal experiences than the broader matters of Nazism. Mrs. Bertholt is focusing on being a catalyst for the cultural rebirth of Nuremberg, keen on remolding the image of a city that had become notorious as the site of the Nazi raliies. An attempt to discuss the period with his housekeepers, Mr. and Mrs. Halbestadt, who had lived near the Dachau concentration camp, proves equally fruitless for Judge Haywood, as they cannot help but focus on the loss of their child in the bombing and the fact that they nearly starved from poverty. Whether anyone knew anything mattered little, for Germans were looking forward, not backward, still grappling with, and recovering from, the hardships and losses that the war brought to them and their families.Only in the courtroom will Judge Haywood have the opportunity to gain insights into the realities of the period. First hand evidence of a) all German judges having sworn to a Nazi oath of allegiance, b) human sterilization orders signed by the defendants and carried out, and c) the execution of a Jew merely for having relations with a non-Jew, painted an evil picture of the ways in which the law had been applied by the defendants during Nazism. Still, Judge Haywood cannot fully come to grips with why these judges had been willing to enforce the law in such a horrific manner. Not, at least, until the defendant Ernst Janning feels compelled to make a statement, against the advice of his counsel ().In his statement made under oath, Janning speaks of how economically-stricken Germany had become a nation of fearful, desperate people, and how only such a people could submit to Nazism. Hitler's promises, Janning explained, in which he openly vowed the elimination of those accountable for Germany's hardships were, at first, soothing and reassuring to them. Janning then noted that, even once the complicit realized the unconscionability and inhumanity of Hitler's approach, they stayed at their posts to help things from getting even worse, but, predictably, failed to derail the atrocities of the times. He explained that national allegiance had motivated most of them to the point that they sacrificed their own personal senses of morality. In a deeply personal, yet self-damning, statement, he conceded that most of them should have known better, and that those that had gone along had betrayed Germany.At long last, the issue at the heart of the case becomes clear to Judge Haywood - the choice that the defendants had to make was between allegiance to their country and allegiance to their own senses of right and wrong. Understanding the times and context in which the actions of the defendants took place, Judge Haywood is ready to pass judgment on the defendants. He sentences each to life imprisonment, noting that their actions were illegal under both International law and German law, and further notes that they were men of sufficient intellect, prominence and credibility in Germany that their refusal to help transform the German court system into an institution that, systematically, denied justice to enemies of the Third Reich might have made a difference.As noted in the closing moments of the film, none of those condemned to a sentence less than death at any of the Nuremberg trials was still serving their term just over a decade later. Once Germany became a Cold War ally of America, it gradually opened the door for their release."

Hayley Mills plays twins who, unknown to their divorced parents, meet at a summer camp. Products of single parent households, they switch places so as to meet the parent they never knew, and then contrive to reunite them.—Stewart M. Clamen <clamen@cs.cmu.edu> Thirteen-year-olds prim and proper Bostonian Sharon McKendrick (Hayley Mills) and tomboyish Californian Susan Evers (Hayley Mills) meet at summer camp. It's hate at first sight, as besides the differing length of their hair, they look exactly the same. After the girls carry out one battle after another against each other, the camp administrators ultimately place the two in solitary confinement, the two eating, sleeping, and playing only with each other. It is during this confinement that they finally get a chance to know each other and learn that they are indeed twins, separated when they were babies when their parents, Maggie McKendrick (Maureen O'Hara) and Mitch Evers (Brian Keith), divorced. Wanting to get to know and ultimately love the parent they never met, Sharon and Susan decide to switch places, Sharon will go to California and pretend to be Susan, and Susan will go to Boston and pretend to be Sharon. The other thing they believe is that their parents still love each other, why else had neither ever remarried. The two parents would ultimately have to ""un-switch"" them, when the girls hope their parents will fall in love all over again. Sharon and Susan are initially able to carry off the ruse, but in California, their plan hits a snag when Mitch introduces his daughter to a young woman named Vicky Robinson (Joanna Barnes), Vicky, who aspires to be the second Mrs. Mitchell Evers. Sharon and the domestics in the Evers household think Vicky is merely a gold digger out for Mitch's money. Sharon and Susan have to figure out a way to get rid of Vicky and bring Maggie to California more quickly than planned, so that their parents can reconcile, and the foursome can be one big happy family.—Huggo Sharon McKendrick (Hayley Mills) arrives at Camp Inch from Boston, Massachusetts. It isn't long before she encounters Susan Evers (Hayley Mills), whom Sharon's camp-mates notice seems to resemble her.An insult by Susan soon leads to a rivalry between the two girls, ending with a fight during a dance at the camp. The head of the camp Miss Inch (Ruth McDevitt), then isolates the two in a cabin for the remaining weeks as punishment.At first, the two girls refuse to talk to each other, but eventually, they open up and begin to discuss their lives. Sharon tells of living in Boston with her mother, and Susan tells of living on her father's ranch in Monterey, California. Both note that neither of their parents are married, but when It is revealed that they both share the same Birthday (November 12th), Sharon suspects something. Susan mentions that she once saw a picture of her mother, before her Dad found out and hid it away. Sharon then reveals a picture of her own mother...and the two then realize that they are sisters!As they realize that neither of their parents has remarried, Sharon feels that they must still love each other, leading to Susan hatching a bold plan: they will switch places once camp is over, and live in each other's respective shoes, getting to know the parent they've never met. There is also the hope that if the switch is found out, their parents will have to ""unswitch"" them, with the girls hoping they can bring their divorced parents back together.The two then learn the basics of each other's lives, and Susan completes the transformation by cutting Sharon's hair, and getting her to bite her fingernails (one of Susan's habits).Camp eventually ends, and the two sisters part ways.Susan heads to Boston, where she meets her Grandfather, Grandmother, and her Mother, Maggie (Maureen O'Hara). Susan is eager to know more about her Mother's former relationship, and after making her fear that she's engaged in a serious summer romance, the two go out for a walk.Susan quickly puts her Mother's fears to rest about boys, and gets her to open up about her first date with her Father. Her mother tells of an Italian restaurant called Martinelli's, as well as the melody to a song that played during the date.Meanwhile, Sharon arrives in California, and meets her Father, Mitch (Brian Keith). Things get a little awkward when Sharon's accent pops out a few times, and upon arriving at the ranch, Susan's dog Andromeda does not greet her warmly.As the housekeeper Verbena (Una Merkel) helps her unpack, Sharon sees her father talking to a woman in the house's main courtyard. Verbena nonchalantly tells that Mitch has been seeing a woman named Vicky (Joanna Barnes) for a few weeks, but Verbena feels this woman is just after Mitch's money.Sharon is soon introduced to Vicky, and while Mitch gets them some drinks, Sharon tries to convince Vicky that her father is a real ladies man, not looking to settle for just one woman...leading Vicky to believe that Mitch's daughter could be trouble for her plans.Before they parted, the twins scheduled an early-morning call after they returned to their homes. During the call, Sharon demands that Susan get their mother to California after meeting Vicky, but Susan stubbornly refuses, claiming she wants to spend more time with their Mother,
leaving Sharon to deal with Vicky on her own.Following the call, Sharon accompanies her Father to the local country club, and attempts to get him to tell her more about her Mother, but he misconstrues her questioning. The mood is broken when the two meet Vicky and her mother Edna (Linda Watkins) afterwards, before Father and Daughter return to the ranch.Verbena finds Sharon talking to herself, and questions her about some of the changes she's noticed. It is when she begins to claim that the young girl seems to be a different person, that Sharon quietly confesses who she really is, and swears Verbena to secrecy.Mitch continues to try and discuss his plans to wed Vicky, but Sharon tries to play dumb and deter him, eventually getting exasperated and throwing a tantrum, leading her father to walk away.Vicky attempts to once again charm Sharon, but the girl is having none of it. When Sharon claims Vicky may just be marrying Mitch for his money, Vicky gets defensive, and declares that she is going to marry Sharon's father, whether the girl likes it or not.Realizing the direness of the situation, Sharon sends Susan a cryptic telegram, requesting another early-morning call.During the call, Sharon explains to Susan that the plans for the wedding are moving quickly, and they need to get their mother out to California right away. Susan says she will explain herself to their Mother the next day, but on her way back to her room, Susan encounters her Grandfather, who overheard the whole conversation and now knows the truth.The next day, Susan confesses who she is, and explains to her mother about Mitch's impending marriage. Maggie makes plans to return Susan to her ex-husband...right after she and her daughter stop off in New York City for some clothes shopping.When Susan and her mother arrive at Mitch's ranch, it happens to be on the day when Vicky, her mother, and Reverend Mosby (Leo G Carroll) have stopped by to discuss the impending wedding. Naturally, the new arrivals throw the plans into major disarray, and the planning session is called off.Later on that evening, Mitch and Maggie are directed to the main area of the house, where Verbena has prepared an Italian meal, and the ranch hand Hecky (Crahan Denton) provides atmosphere as a gypsy. The parents are then surprised when their daughters perform a musical duet, before claiming they are going to bed.Mitch is unsure what is going on, but when Maggie finds a sign mentioning ""Martinelli's,"" she realizes the girls are trying to recreate their first date. However, the conversation soon turns into an argument, and it seems the girls' plans have fallen through.The next day, Maggie prepares to return to Boston with Sharon, only for the girls to appear wearing identical clothing. Neither girl is willing to tell who is Sharon or Susan, and propose a deal: they want Maggie and Sharon to go on the camping trip Mitch and Susan are going off on that afternoon, with the caveat that when they get back, they will reveal which girl is which.The two adults agree to the arrangement, but when Vicky comes over and finds out about the arrangement, Maggie decides to make a compromise: she'll stay behind, and Vicky can go with Mitch and the girls to get to know them.Naturally, Vicky isn't accustomed to roughing it. The girls play pranks on her, from putting a lizard on her canteen, to claiming there's a way to keep mountain lions away. When they reach the campsite, the girls trick her into thinking the nearby river is shallow, and she ends up soaking wet.During dinner, Vicky refuses to eat the trout that's been caught, and is also informed by Mitch that the bug spray the girls gave her, is just sugar and water.After Vicky goes to sleep, the girls rig her tent, including pouring honey on her feet that attracts a few bear cubs.

Yojimbo,1961,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0055630/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A crafty ronin comes to a town divided by two criminal gangs and decides to play them against each other to free the town. Sanjuro, a wandering samurai enters a rural town in nineteenth century Japan. After learning from the innkeeper that the town is divided between two gangsters, he plays one side off against the other. His efforts are complicated by the arrival of the wily Unosuke, the son of one of the gangsters, who owns a revolver. Unosuke has Sanjuro beaten after he reunites an abducted woman with her husband and son, then massacres his father's opponents. During the slaughter, the samurai escapes with the help of the innkeeper; but while recuperating at a nearby temple, he learns of innkeeper's abduction by Unosuke, and returns to the town to confront him.—Bernard Keane <BKeane2@email.dot.gov.au> A samurai, Sanjuro Kuwabatake, finds himself in a town run by two warlords, Ushitora and Seibei. The town is a den of inequity, not only due to the warlords and their hired thugs, but due to the hordes of gamblers that inhabit it. The samurai sets out to rid the town of all these pestilences, his plan being to play the two warlords off against each other.—grantss Sanjuro Kuwabatake is a samurai without a master, drifting without any specific destination. He arrives in a small village, dominated by two lords: Seibei, who produces silk, and Ushitora, who produces sake. Both of them explore gambling, and uses fugitive gangster for the protection of their business. They are constantly fighting against each other. Sanjuro offers his service of bodyguard for both of them and waits for the best offer.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil In the late 19th century, a ""ronin"" (Toshiro Mifune) (a samurai without a master) wanders down a dusty path. Happening onto a house, he asks the man to drink from the man's well. The man is busy berating his teenage son, who is going off to join a nearby gang of gamblers and doesn't want ""a long life of eating gruel"". After the son leaves, the man insults the ronin by saying that all sorts are attracted when ""they smell blood"".Walking into the nearby town, the ronin sees the streets are empty. A few angry glances from young gang members (mangier even than the ronin) are shot at him from sliding doors. The ronin is caught-off guard when he sees a dog trot by with a human hand in it's mouth. A young-looking gang confronts the ronin, but he wanders off unfazed.He wanders into an empty tavern and orders to the elderly owner, Gonji (Eijirô Tono). Gonji only has hot saki and cold rice, but the ronin hungrily engulfs it. Gonji explains the hierarchy of the town to the ronin. Seibei (Seizaburô Kawazu) is the older crime boss of the town, and runs a brothel with his domineering wife, Orin (Isuzu Yamada). Seibei appointed silk merchant Tazaemon (Kamatari Fujiwara) the town's major, but Tazaemon is a puppet for Seibei. The competing and more powerful crime boss is Ushitora (Kyu Sazanka), who rules with violence along with his pig-like brother, Inokichi (Daisuke Katô). Ushitora has appointed the corrupt sake-brewer Tokuemon (Takashi Shimura) as the mayor (also) and is more widely-recognized than the powerless Tazaemon, who now wanders around beating a drum in anger. Thinking that his explanation of the town would motivate the ronin to leave, Gonji is shocked when the ronin says that he's going to ""stay for a while"".The ronin goes over to Seibei's home and summons his gang out. He tells them he's going to show them his skills. The ronin then goes over to Ushitora's home and is confronted by the same hoodlums who surrounded him earlier. As they posture in front of him, the ronin promises to kill them. The hoodlums attack and the ronin kills several of the men in a matter of seconds. The ronin tells the nearby cooper (Atsushi Watanabe) how many coffins he needs to make.The ronin returns to Seibei's home and Seibei gratefully accepts him. Since he is planning to attack Ushitora, Seibei wants to employ the ronin as a bodyguard. The ronin negotiates the salary to a much higher amount and agrees to the position. Seibei asks the ronin his age and his name and, after the ronin puzzles for a moment out the window at a mulberry field, the ronin says his name is ""Sanjuro Kuwabatake"" (Thirty-something mulberry field) although he says he's ""actually nearly forty"". Orin comes and calls Seibei to the other room. Sanjuro eavesdrops on them and hears that they're planning to kill him after they use him to lead the attack against Ushitora.At noon, Seibei's men and Sanjuro gather outside across the street from Ushitora's gang. When they start marching forward, Sanjuro walks off. He let's Seibei know that he overheard their scheme to kill him. Sanjuro climbs the nearby bell tower and laughs as he watches the two cowardly gangs lunge and retreat at each other on the street. The gangs never make contact and are interrupted when an inspector comes inquiring about an official killed nearby (actually killed by Ushitora's men). Ushitora and Seibei promise to finish their clash later.Sanjuro return's to Gonji's tavern and watches out the window Ushitora and then Seibei fawn over the inspector. Later, Ushitora and his giant thug, Kannuki (Namigoro Rashomon), come into Gonji's tavern and offer Sanjuro a position with him as a bodyguard. Sanjuro says he has many offers and has to think it over. Later still, when the wind is blowing gusts, a commotion surrounds the return of Unosuke (Tatsuya Nakadai), Ushitora's youngest and deadliest sibling. Unosuke has attained a pistol in his world travels and shows off with it by shooting at the town bell.That night, Sanjuro convinces Seibei that he will spy on Ushitora. As a gratitude, Orin offers her geishas to Sanjuro but he declines. Out on the street, Sanjuro happens upon two of Ushitora's drunken thugs he overheard talking in the tavern and tricks them into confessing they killed the official. He incapacitates them with his sword and ties them up, giving them to Seibei. He goes back to Ushitora and says he caught the two conspiring with Seibei. In response, Seibei's son Yoichiro is taken hostage by Unosuke and Ushitora's thugs.Shortly thereafter, as Sanjuro watches from Gonji's window, the two gangs meet in the street. A young man, Kohei (Yoshio Tsuchiya) and his young son (Yosuke Natsuki), come into Gonji's tavern and watch anxiously. There is a plan to exchange the two men for Yoichiro, but Unosuke shoots the two men. In response, Seibei reveals he has a second bargaining chip as well, the beautiful Nui (Yôko Tsukasa). Nui is Kohei's wife, but after he came to owe gambling money to Ushitora, Nui was pimped out to Tokuemon. Kohei has had to listen as Tokuemon ravishes Nui every night. He is also regularly beaten by Inokichi. When the two gangs agree to trade their hostages, a tense situation ensues as Nui realizes her son and husband are at Gonji's. Nui is dragged away from her family and back to Tokuemon's and Ushitora's clutches.That night, Sanjuro finds out where Nui is being kept and that six men are guarding her now. Sanjuro walks along with Inokichi and reminds him that he needs to beat Kohei. Shortly after Inokichi goes into to do so, Sanjuro rushes and tells Inokichi that the six guards have been killed and that he must go back and tell Ushitora and Unosuke. When Inokichi rushes off, Sanjuro burst in on and kills all six guards quickly. He burst in on and pulls out Nui and reconnects her with Kohei and their son. Sanjuro trashes the room to make it look like a struggle has occurred. When he returns outside, Sanjuro finds Kohei & Nui tearfully bowing to him, much to his annoyance. He says he hates pathetic people and tells them he will kill them if they don't run, which they promptly do.Seconds later, Ushitora, Unosuke and some of their thugs come back and are convinced that the massacre of the guards is the act of Seibei's men. Shortly thereafter, Tazaemon's silk warehouse is set on fire, and in response, Tokuemon's sake storage is hacked open.Sanjuro walks into Gonji's tavern and is surprised to see the usually grumpy old man beaming. It turns out Kohei has left a thank you note for rescuing them and Gonji is happy that Sanjuro is a good man underneath the gruff and violent exterior. However, Unosuke enters the tavern and begins to grill Sanjuro. Unosuke is able to take away Sanjuro's sword and intercepts Gonji as he tries to take off Kohei's note. While out looking for Nui, Unosuke had heard of Sanjuro helping them escape.Sanjuro is captured and beaten badly by Kannuki and the rest of Ushitora's gang. Despite the continual beatings, Sanjuro refuses to disclose Nui's location (which he doesn't know). During a break in the beatings, the badly-injured Sanjuro hides in a chest in the room. Kannuki and a cohort return and are bewildered that he's not there. When Kannuki rushes back to tell the others (leaving the previously locked door open), Sanjuro crawls outside and gets under a nearby walkway just in time. Ushitora's whole gang desperately search for Sanjuro, not realizing he's literally right under their feet. Seeing an opening, Sanjuro manages to crawl on to the street and to Gonji's tavern. Sanjuro tells Gonji to tell Ushitora's men that he went to Seibei's and hides in the corner of the tavern under some debris.When Gonji tells Unosuke Sanjuro's story, Unosuke goes back to Ushitora and pitches this situation as an change to finally eradicate Seibei and his men. Meanwhile, Gonji gets the cooper to place Sanjuro in a coffin so they can carry it off to a secure location. When Gonji and the cooper carry out Sanjuro in the coffin, he asks them to stop so he can peak out and view the chaos as Ushitora finally eliminates Seibei. Ushitora's men have set Seibei's brothel on fire, forcing all of Seibei's out to shot by Unosuke or slashed to death by Ushitora's men. Finally, Seibei, Orin and their son come out surrendering. Despite being unarmed, they are brutally killed by Unosuke and Inokichi. While they watched the ghastly spectacle, the cowardly cooper has ran off. Gonji is forced to convince the now lone Inokichi to help him carry the coffin containing Sanjuro. Gonji and Inokichi carry Sanjuro to the graveyard, but Gonji dupes Inokichi into going back into town to look for Sanjuro. Sanjuro takes refuge in a nearby temple.After several days of recovering, Sanjuro shows his returned skill by catching a floating leaf on a knife he throws. When Sanjuro hears somebody coming, he thinks it's Gonji coming to bring him more food. But it's actually the cooper and he tells Sanjuro that Ushitora's men captured Gonji carrying food and are beating him for Sanjuro's location.Angrily, Sanjuro arms himself with a sword and a knife and marches into town. A beaten Gonji is seen hanging prostrate from a rope in the middle of town. Realizing that Sanjuro is there, the whole of Ushitora's gang gathers in the street. Sanjuro menacingly stomps towards them. Unosuke pulls out his pistol and warns Sanjuro to stop. Sanjuro instead breaks into a sprint. Unosuke levels his gun at Sanjuro, but Sanjuro throws his knife into Unosuke's arm before he can even fire. With amazing speed, Sanjuro unsheathes his sword and lethally slashes Ushitora's whole gang, including Unosuke, Inokichi and Ushitora himself. Sanjuro spares only one of Ushitora's cowering thugs, recognizing him as the son of the house where he wondering at the start. He tells him to ""live a long life eating gruel!"" Lying in a puddle of his own blood, Unosuke asks Sanjuro to hand him his pistol because he feels naked without it. When Sanjuro gives Unosuke his pistol, Unosuke grins and points it at Sanjuro, but it misfires, once he has lowered it, it fires. Sanjuro doesn't flinch. Unosuke dies. A crazed-looking Tazaemon comes out beating his drum and, seeing Tokuemon, suddenly stumbles across the street and kills him. Sanjuro cuts Gonji loose from the rope and tells him that the town should be ""pretty quiet"" now. Sanjuro says ""See ya later"" and walks off out of the now nearly empty town."

After having sex with Minus she realizes she is unable to live in two worlds and must choose between institutionalization and home life.—garykmcd ""Through a Glass Darkly,"" originally titled ""The Wallpaper,"" is the first part in a film trilogy, the start to a new direction taken by Ingmar Bergman: ""chamber films,"" so named for their analogy to chamber music.First Movement. The film opens with the mirroring of a gloomy sky on the placid Baltic Sea waters at the Faro Island shores, near Gotland's northernmost tip. Four bathers, all in a jovial mood, splashing and joking, are returning from a swim in the cold sea. As they reach the jetty, the youngest members of the quartet, Karin (Harriet Andersson) and her teenage brother, Fredrik, known as Minus (Lars Passgard), are sent off to get some milk at a nearby farm, while Karin's physician husband, Martin (Max von Sydow), and her father, David (Gunnar Bjorstrand), a writer, go and set up their fishing nets. David has just returned from Switzerland, where he was finishing writing his latest novel, and their task gives them a private opportunity to discuss Karin's status, whose schizophrenia has been diagnosed as most likely incurable.On the way to the farm, Minus expresses his hope that their father will be successful with his latest novel's publication. On the way back, Minus confides in his sister his sexual apprehensions, which eventually degenerates into his admonishment of Karin for the (maybe) too intimate attention she keeps showing toward him. But most importantly, he confesses how much he wishes he could communicate with his father.The quartet is reunited for the evening dinner around a table in front of their cottage. Again, a festive atmosphere prevails, but soon turns sour. David confesses that while he was anxious to return to his family after his long absence, that he is about to leave again, in spite of his earlier promise to his children not to travel so often. Somewhat guiltily, and seeking forgiveness, David distributes some presents, all of them turning out to be unsuitable. He goes into the house under the pretense of getting his pipe tobacco, but it is only to release his pent-up anguish at being trapped in his own narcissistic world. When David returns to the table, the family proposes to perform a short play, written by Minus as a gift to his father. The play, ""The Artistic Haunting"" or ""The Tomb of Illusions,"" tells of a prince who chooses world fame over love. This, of course, strikes too close to David for comfort, but he nevertheless applauds.Readying themselves for bed, Karin and Martin discuss the evening, and Karin turns down her husband's tender advances. But later in the night, the cry of gulls awakens her and, following her inner voices, she steals out of the room to an abandoned upstairs room. In the room, she presses her ear to the wall, listening to voices emanating from behind it. She moves to the center of the room, falls to her knees in ecstasy, and achieves a sexual climax. Karin descends to her father's room, where he is still putting some last touches on his novel. He carries her to his bed, tucks her in, and she falls asleep. Minus appears standing on the window sill, and asks his father to come and join him in retrieving the nets. Some time after their departure, Karin awakens. Rummaging in David's desk, she finds his diary, which she opens toward the last written pages and reads, ""Her illness is incurableI'm horrified by my curiosity, by my urge to record its course, to make an accurate description of her gradual disintegration, to use her."" Karin is crushed by her discovery. She returns to her bedroom and tells her husband about some of her findings in David's diary. But she cannot bring herself to tell him that David is actually studying her descent into madness. Martin tries unconvincingly to reassure her.Second Movement. Karin and Minus are alone. Minus is ""studying"" his Latin book, into which he has hidden a girlie magazine. Karin uncovers the subterfuge and teases him about it. In this moment of familiarity, Karin tells Minus her terrible secret, her experience in the room upstairs, and takes him to the room. She explains her experience with the voices she hears from behind the flower wallpaper. She tells him how she passes through the wall into an adjacent room where people are waiting for ""Him."" Karin further confesses to Minus that she has sacrificed Martin for the ""other."" On the other hand, somewhat lucidly, she states she is not sure this is all real.Some time later, Minus is looking desperately everywhere for Karin, who has disappeared from his sight. At last, he finds her lying down inside the hull of a beached boat wreck. Minus approaches Karin, who is lying on the boards in a fetal position, and leans over her. Karin, with a devilish grin on her face suddenly reaches for him, and forces him against her in a passionate embrace. We guess from the next scene, where Minus is holding Karin in his arms that incest has occurred.Meanwhile, David and Martin, who went by motorboat to Gotland, have anchored the boat and are having lunch. Martin confronts David's having written in his diary about Karin and her sickness. What follows is a disturbing exchange of accusations. David admits to studying Karin and her illness as a subject for his next book, but doesn't Martin wish at times for Karin's death? David confesses that recently in Switzerland, he tried to commit suicide, but fate (God?) intervened and saved him. At that moment, David manages, for the first time, to communicate his inner most feelings:"" From the void within me, something was born that I can't touch or name. A love. For Karin. For Minus. For you.""David and Martin, returning to their island, are greeted at the pier by Minus, who tells them about Karin's latest crisis. They all run to the shipwreck. As Karin expresses her wish to talk privately to her father, Martin is vexed and possibly guesses what happened between the two siblings. He leaves to go get an ambulance for Karin. Karin tells her father that she is giving up ""living in two worlds,"" and wants to be committed. She also hints unambiguously at the incest. David's transformation continues as he confesses his guilt to Karin.Third Movement. Karin is in her room, packing her bags. As Martin goes to fetch some medicine for her, she slips away to the abandoned room upstairs. When David and Martin find her there, she is standing in the middle of the room talking to ""them."" Martin enters the room and Karin tells him to rejoice at God's imminent arrival. She tells her husband to come and kneel with her, to wait for God to appear. The helicopter ambulance arrives in a roar of engine and whirring blades that makes the house shake and the closet door open. Through the window, we catch a glimpse of the helicopter landing like a giant spider suspended by an invisible thread. Suddenly, Karin is overwhelmed by her vision of the spider-God. She run down stairs and is stopped by Minus, thus allowing Martin enough time to inject her with a sedative. As she calms down, she describes her vision of a horrifying ""spider-God"" who tried to penetrate her. The ambulance nurse knocks at the door. Karin puts on her sunglasses, as if they were a symbolic of cutting herself from the world, and calmly walks to the waiting ambulance.Following his sister's departure, Minus enters his father's room for the first time. Minus tells him of his panic over going on living, after the latest happenings. David's answer to his son is that he can live if he can hold unto something. ""I do not know if love is proof of God's existence, or if love is God himself,"" says David, but, ""that thought helps me in my emptiness and my dirty despair."" After some more exchanges, as David leaves the room to prepare dinner, Minus, in near ecstasy says, ""Papa spoke to me."""
"One, Two, Three",1961,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0055256/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"In West Berlin during the Cold War, a Coca-Cola executive is given the task of taking care of his boss' socialite daughter. Berlin is the epitome of political and economic polarization. A microcosm of that polarization is the life of American C.R. MacNamara, known as Mac to his friends. He is Coca-Cola's head of West Berlin operations, although he feels he deserves to be Coca-Cola's head of European operations based in London. His wife Phyllis wants him to get a steady, stable job back in head office in Atlanta. His West Berlin staff is still used to treating him like their old master, the Führer. The one exception is his secretary Ingeborg, who is the latest in his long line of secretary mistresses. And he's working on a trade agreement of getting Coca-Cola into the Russian market. His life goes into a tailspin when he hosts Scarlett Hazeltine, 17-year-old spoiled partygirl daughter of his Atlanta-based boss, Wendell Hazeltine. Unlike most of the stops she's made on her European trip, Scarlett seems to like West Berlin and stays longer than expected. On the day that Mac learns that Mr. and Mrs. Hazeltine will be in Berlin in 24 hours to retrieve their daughter, he learns that Scarlett has married Otto Ludwig Piffl, a staunch East German Communist. Mac feels this marriage will ruin his career and does whatever he can to get rid of Otto for good and wipe any record of the marriage off the official books. But when Mac further learns that Scarlett is pregnant, he must get Otto back, which is more difficult than getting rid of his was, and to make him respectable in Mr. Hazeltine's eyes. Meanwhile, Phyllis has her own ideas of what is right and wrong in both Scarlett's and Mac's lives and takes appropriate action.—Huggo C.R. ""Mac"" MacNamara is a high-ranking executive in the Coca-Cola company, assigned to the corporate office located in West Berlin. Mac's dreams are to climb the corporate ladder in the company to eventually become the head of Western European Coca-Cola Operations. One day, Mac receives a call from his boss, W.P. Hazeltine, to look after his 17-year old socialite daughter, who is coming to West Berlin, while he is on a trip. Soon enough, Mac finds himself in the undesirable circumstances of trying to take care of this young whirlwind and manage all of the problems she causes.—Kyle Perez In 1961, C.R. MacNamara is the manager of Coca Cola's West Berlin branch. His boss's daughter is on a European tour and ends up staying with MacNamara and his family for several weeks. One day she reveals that she has married an East Berlin communist. This will not be good for MacNamara's career, so he sets out to undermine the relationship.—grantss In post-WWII Berlin, C.R. MacNamara presides over the German branch of Coca-Cola and works hard and trying his very best to impress the Atlanta headquarters, since he's heard that European headquarters in London will soon be looking for a new head. Now, Coca-Cola boss Mr. Hazeltine asks MacNamara to take care of his daughter Scarlett, who is taking a trip to Europe. But Scarlett doesn't behave like a respectable young girl: instead of sightseeing, she stays out all night partying and finally falls in love with Otto Piffl, a flaming young Communist from East Berlin, and marries him. When MacNamara hears of this, he schemes mightily with his assistant Schlemmer to get Piffl into an East German prison, but when he then finds out that the Hazeltines are coming to Berlin to fetch their daughter, he needs to get Piffl out again, convert him to Capitalism, and present him as a noble young husband in order to get his London post, and all of that very quickly.—Julian Reischl <julianreischl@mac.com> In his last starring film, James Cagney plays Coca-Cola executive C.R. MacNamara. Assigned to manage Coke's West Berlin office, MacNamara dreams of being transferred to London, and to do this he must curry favor with his Atlanta-based boss, Hazeltine Thus, MacNamara agrees to look after Hazeltine's dizzy, impulsive daughter, Scarlett, during her visit to Germany. Weeks pass, and on the eve of Hazeltine's visit to West Berlin, Scarlett announces that she's gotten married. Even worse, her husband is a hygienically challenged East Berlin Communist named Otto Piffl. The crafty MacNamara arranges for Piffl to be arrested by the East Berlin police and to have the marriage annulled, only to discover that Scarlett is pregnant. In rapid-fire ""one, two, three"" fashion, MacNamara must arrange for Piffl to be released by the Communists and successfully pass off the scrungy, doggedly anti-capitalist Piffl as an acceptable husband for Scarlett. MacNamara must accomplish this in less than 12 hours, all the while trying to mollify his wife, who has learned of his affair with busty secretary Ingeborg. Seldom pausing for breath, Billy Wilders film is a crackling, mile-a-minute farce, taking satiric scatter shots at Coca-Cola, the Cold War (the film is set in the months just before the erection of the Berlin Wall), Russian red tape, Communist and capitalist hypocrisy, Southern bigotry, the German ""war guilt,"" rock music, and even Cagney 's own movie image. Not all the gags are in the best of taste, and most of the one-liners have dated rather badly, but Cagneys mesmerizing performance holds the whole affair together."

Sir Robert Cargrave, a London-based research physician, is known for his revolutionary work, mostly in what is considered the cutting edge treatment of paralysis. He rushes off immediately to the region of Gorslava on the central continent upon receiving a letter from a former love, Baroness Maude Sardonicus née Randall, in a request from her husband, the Baron, to meet him. Mr. Randall forbade Maude to marry Robert, he not yet having made a name for himself, in favor of someone of substance (i.e. with money), hence her marrying the Baron. The reason for Robert's haste in his reunion with Maude is her stating that her well-being is at stake. Upon arriving in Gorslava, Robert senses that the Baron evokes fear among those around him, and that even the Baron's faithful one-eyed servant, Krull, operates in that fear. Robert also learns that much of Krull's work is doing experimental research of his own on the Baron's directive, despite Krull having no background in such. The Baron is ultimately up front to him about the reason he summoned Robert. Beyond the threats he issues, the Baron displays a certainty that Robert will do what he wants.

Even Krull is not immune to the baron's cruelty; he is missing an eye, lost to Sardonicus' anger.Sardonicus tells his story to Sir Robert. He was born Marek Toleslawski, a farmer like his father Henryk (Vladimir Sokoloff). Marek and his wife Elenka (Erika Peters) lived a humble life with his father, but Elenka and Henryk wanted more. Henryk bought a ticket for the national lottery but died before the drawing; after his burial, Marek and Elenka discovered that the ticket won but had been buried with Henryk. Elenka insisted that Marek retrieve the ticket from the grave to prove his love to her. Upon opening the grave, Marek was traumatized by the sight of Henryk's ""grinning"" skull. His face was frozen in a horrifying grin, leaving him unable to speak intelligibly. Elenka, terrified by the transformation, committed suicide. The lottery prize allowed Marek to buy a title and a castle, but he had no one to share them with. Marek renamed himself ""Sardonicus"" and hired speech experts to retrain him to speak. He conducted experiments on young women to find a cure for his condition, but had no success. He learned from his new wife, Maude, that Sir Robert was a great doctor specializing in paralysis, and he had hoped Sir Robert could restore his face.Sir Robert agrees to try, but he is unsuccessful. Sardonicus demands he try more experimental treatments. When Sir Robert refuses, Sardonicus threatens to mutilate Maude's face to match his own. Sir Robert sends for a deadly South American plant and uses it to experiment on dogs. Sardonicus displays Henryk's open coffin, giving Sir Robert an idea: He will inject Sardonicus with plant extract, then recreate the trauma that caused Sardonicus' condition. The operation is a success, and Sardonicus' face is restored. Sir Robert advises him to not speak until his facial muscles have had time to adjust. The baron writes a note to Maude releasing her from their marriage, and another to Sir Robert asking his fee. Sir Robert refuses any fee, and Sardonicus lets them go.As they prepare to leave by train, Krull implores them to return. Sardonicus has lost the power of speech again, and he cannot open his jaw or lips. Sir Robert tells Krull that the injection was only water, and that the plant extract would have been lethal even in a small dose. It was a placebo, and Sardonicus' affliction was only psychosomatic. Once Sardonicus realizes that, he will be completely restored.Krull returns to the castle and tells the baron that he just missed Sir Robert's train. Krull sits down to eat his lavish dinner in front of Baron Sardonicus who is doomed to starve."

The police does what it can to stop these acts but the resources and manpower are stretched to the limit. Detective Inspector Sayers is in charge of the West End rackets investigation. But witnesses are afraid to talk to the police. The crime syndicate had some initial success and the money is flowing. Former cat burglar Paddy Damion is recruited by the mob to act as the syndicate's enforcer. His girlfriend, Sadie, is an attractive blonde but he prefers to court nightclub singer Anya Bergodin who is Waldo's mistress. Ever more greedy for money, Waldo wants to go into the big time rackets and starts putting the squeeze on major construction companies and land developers. Upset about this, one member of the crime syndicate, Alf Peters, quits the group. Annoyed by his departure, the other mobsters start a gang war against Alf. When the war escalates, the government takes notice and the pressure on the law enforcement forces the police to arrest and then recruit Paddy Damion to rat on the syndicate. Its days are numbered.—nufs68"

The story opens in 1843, New Orleans. Roguish gambler Paul Regret (Stuart Whitman) has a duel with a man over a woman and despite attempting to just try and wound him when he fires at him, Regret kills him. When he discovers that the man is in fact the son of a Louisiana judge, he goes on the run to escape the death penalty. Whilst on a riverboat, he is approached by a mysterious woman named Pilar (Ina Bolin), who has one of her men called Amelung (Michael Ansarra) find out who Regret is. Regret is originally suspicious but Pilar convinces him she is interested in Regret and not his money and they fall for each other.The next morning, Texas Ranger captain Jake Cutter (John Wayne) turns up in his room to arrest him. His assignment is to take him to the Texas Rangers headquarters to be handed over to a Louisiana marshal. Before they depart the boat, Regret wants to say goodbye to Pilar but she's gone. With Jake on horseback and Regret on a slower mule to discourage escape, the two travel across the plains. They come to a ranch that Jake used to own. After his wife died, he decided to sell the ranch to a family. As Jake is approaching the family home,he notices some smoke. The ranch has been attacked by Indians and the entire family have been massacred. After Jake gets him to bury the victims, Regret sees an opportunity to escape. He knocks Jake out with a shovel to the head and takes the horse leaving Jake with the mule.Back at Ranger's headquarters a man, Ed McBain, who was arrested for gun running tells Jake and Major Henry (Bruce Cabot) that he was on his way to a town called Sweetwater to sell the stolen army rifles to a contact that he's never met before. Jake goes undercover and takes the McBain's place as the gunrunner in order to go and meet the contact. He arrives at the hotel in Sweetwater to meet his contact who turns out to be Tully Crow (Lee Marvin). Crow tells Jake that his partial scalping was the act of a Comanche tribe and before he was killed he was saved by a group called the Comancheros - the group he's now working for. Crow searches the wagon for the guns and they are not there. Jake tells Crow that he buried the guns because he wasn't sure if he could trust his contact. The two go on a night out to get to know each other before they make a deal. First they get drunk in a saloon and Crow shoots the place up. Then they go on to a quiet restaurant and decide to join a group of men in a poker game. As they introduce themselves, Jake sees that one of the card players is Paul Regret. Regret looks uneasy and Jake is quick to introduce himself as Ed McBain. They shake hands and Crow appears suspicious of the two men. Jake wins a few hands and Crow becomes increasingly angry that he's losing. Crow accuses Jake and Regret of cheating. Jake tells him he's just drunk and tries to leave. As he walks away ,Crow pulls his gun and Jake whips around and shoots him. Jake thanks Regret for not giving his real identity away but he tells Regret he isn't off the hook. Regret is still a wanted man and Jake arrests him again. He takes him out to the desert and gets him to dig up the rifles that he'd buried.They arrive at a ranch where a family lives that Jake knows. The ranch is occupied by the Texas Rangers who are on a Comanche patrol. The major and the patrol pull out and leave Jake and Regret and a couple of injured Rangers behind. Regret and the Rangers share a meal inside with the rancher and his son while his pregnant wife rests in bed. The wife sees Comanches coming across the river to attack the ranch. Despite been outnumbered, Jake, Regret and the few rangers that are still there including the young Tobe (Patrick Wayne ,and the rancher and son do their best to fend them off. During the shootout, Regret gets away on an available Indian pony. Jake thinks he's escaped his custody again. Regret reappears with Major Henry and the rest of the Rangers to take care of the Comanches. Feeling like they owe Regret something, Jake asks the Major if he can have a word with the judge about a reprieve for Regret for helping to save their lives. Inside the cabin, the rancher's wife gives birth and the rancher suggests naming the baby Cutter after Jake. But Jake refuses and suggests the boy should be named after Regret for his good deed.Jake and Regret eventually arrive at the judge's office and Regret is told that the Rangers plan to commit perjury in order to prevent him from been sentenced. They make him a Texas Ranger with the understanding that he has actually been one for a couple of years so if anyone asks he couldn't have been in New Orleans for the duel and killing.Jake is assigned to go and track down the Comancheros and he requests that Regret be partnered with him. They wander the desert in a wagon with Tobe following in the distance on horse, ready to report back to the Rangers when they uncover the Comanchero hideout. Jake and Regret eventually attract a group of Comanches. They tell the Comanches that they have rifles for the Comancheros. The Comanches take them to the hideout where Jake and Regret discover a secret society of thieves and murderers. Jake tells them they have rifles for them but the firing pins are missing and they are just a sample of what they can offer. Aemlung, the man from the riverboat who saw Regret, orders that they be taken prisoner and tied up by their wrists. Pilar, the woman from the boat who fell for Regret arrives and instantly recognizes Regret and orders that the two men be cut down. The two of them are put on trial by the wheelchair bound but ruthless leader of the community, Graile (Nememiah Persoff), who is Pilar's father. Because of her personal feelings for Regret, she defends them stating that it would be best to let them live as they can provide them with a continuous supply of guns and also use their skills. Graile agrees and gives Jake and Regret a tour of his home and explains the society that he has created. He invites the Jake and Regret for dinner and they spend the time beforehand scoping out the hideout for a possible escape.As sunset approaches, Tobe is in the desert on his way to get help from the rangers but he is ambushed and killed by two Comanches. At Graile's hideout, Pilar tells Jake and Regret that she will have horses prepared ready for their escape. But Jake has no intention of leaving without arresting Graile and he steals a gun from one of the Comacheros and is ready to confront Graile at dinner. As they sit around the dinner table talking, Pilar tells her father that she plans to go away with Regret but she wants her father to leave as well before the Rangers arrive. Graile says he won't leave his empire that he has built and Jake pulls the gun on him. Aemlung walks in with the dead body of Tobe wrapped up in a blanket. Jake gets Regret to take care of Aemlung with his fists because he doesn't want to fire his gun and signal Graile's men. Regret subdues Aemlung and Graile calls in his huge henchman Gordo. After a struggle with Jake and Regret, Jake knocks Gordo out with the pistol. Regret and Pilar get ready to leave and Jake unwraps the rug to look at the dead body and tells Graile that he's going to take pleasure from watching him hang.Jake, Regret and Pilar get ready in the wagon to sneak out with Graile and Aemlung and Pilar's loyal man Esteban. But as they try to quietly depart, Graile shouts out and his henchmen wake up. The mother of a man who was earlier executed by Graile, runs up to the wagon and stabs Graile in the back with a knife. As Regret drives off, Aemlung jumps from the back of the wagon and is untied by his men. A chase ensues with the Comancheros who kill Esteban and later they run into a group of Comanches who join in. Jake is in the back firing his rifle and throws the cover off the wagon so it is dragging behind them and sets fire to it to stop the pursuit from getting too close. Riders get ahead of the wagon and Regret loses control and the wagon flips over. Jake, Regret and Pilar take cover behind the wagon. The Rangers arrive to rescue them. Pilar sees that her father is dead from the knife wound. Amelung tries to kill Jake but Regret shoots him. The story ends with the Rangers cleaning out the headquarters of the Comancheros. Jake says farewell to Regret who is riding south with Pilar."

Murder She Said,1961,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0055205/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"When Miss Jane Marple reports witnessing a murder through the window of a passing train, the police dismiss her as a dotty spinster when no trace of the crime can be found. Miss Jane Marple's (Dame Margaret Rutherford's) on-board a train when she sees what appears to to be, a murder - a woman being strangled - in a passing train. When the Police refuse to believe her story, she decides to do some investigating of her own. In this, Rutherford's first appearance (as well as her first on-screen appearance) as Dame Agatha Christie's beloved sleuth. Though fans of the stories can see instantly see that Dame Margaret Rutherford does not fit Dame Agatha Christie's physical description of her, and Dame Agatha was not a fan with the casting decision - at first. But, when the two women met, they became big admirers of each other (Christie even dedicated one of her books; ""The Mirror Crack'd From Side to Side"" - to her ""friend, Margaret Rutherford"".—Mattias Thuresson Miss Jane Marple (Dame Margaret Rutherford) witnesses a man strangling a woman through the window of a passing train. However, when Police cannot turn up any evidence of the homicide, they dismiss the amateur sleuth as a dotty old woman. She enlists the help of Mr. Stringer (Stringer Davis), the village librarian and a kindred spirit, to trace the exact point where the body was thrown from the train. After the location is pinpointed at Ackenthorpe Hall, she is able to insinuate herself into the manor house disguised as a maid. Although the Lord of the manor is a stingy but likable curmudgeon, Miss Marple suspects the body and the murderer can be found on the premises.—duke1029 On a train home after a shopping expedition, Miss Jane Marple (Dame Margaret Rutherford) sees a woman being strangled on another train that is travelling alongside her own. She reports it to the conductor and the Police investigate, but can find no evidence of foul play and no body. Along with her friend Mr. Stringer (Stringer Davis), she determines that if the body was thrown off the train, it would have to be in the vicinity of Ackenthorpe Hall. She wrangles a post as cook at the hall and soon becomes quite friendly with the youngest of the family, Alexander (Ronnie Raymond). Working there gives her plenty of time to search the grounds, and despite the crusty old Ackenthorpe's (James Robertson Justice's) complaints - he's under the care of the local Dr. Quimper (Arthur Kennedy) for any variety of ailments - she finds the woman's body hidden in one of the outbuildings. Having established that someone was killed, it's left to Miss Marple to determine who she is and who wanted her dead.—garykmcd While travelling back home by train, Miss Jane Marple (Dame Margaret Rutherford) witnesses a woman being strangled by a man in another train. She reports the murder to the Police. However, Inspector Craddock (Charles ""Bud"" Tingwell) does not find any corpse or evidence of the reported murder, and discredits the old lady believing that she is senile and a fan of detective stories. Miss Marple decides to investigate the crime and she concludes that the corpse was dumped at Ackenthorpe Hall and she gets a job of housemaid, cleaning and cooking for the Ackenthorpe family. Soon she learns that they are a dysfunctional family and the heirs are like vultures of selfish patriarch Luther Ackenthorpe (James Robertson Justice), waiting for their inheritance. Therefore, all of them may be the culprit for the murder, or not.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil This is based on the Agatha Christie book ""4:50 from Paddington"" and the opening locale is Paddington Station in London. The movie starts with Miss Jane Marple (Margaret Rutherford) being escorted with her bags, by a porter, onto a train car. While traveling through the countryside another train slowly overtakes and Miss Marple sees a murder being committed -- a man whose face she can't see choking a woman in her thirties.She reports the murder to the porter and although he is disbelieving, he reports it to the authorities at the next station, Brackhampton. At her home, she is interviewed by Inspector Craddock, C.I.D. (Charles Tingwell). He is skeptical, too, as they have done a search for a body and found nothing. Miss Marple informs him she is going to do her own investigation.She enlists the aide of her friend Mr. Stringer (played by Stringer Davis, Margaret Rutherford's real-life husband), the local librarian, and they do a search along the railroad line. There they find a piece of the fur from the murdered woman's fur collar at the top of a masonry wall that separates the rail line from a private estate, which Mr. Stringer identifies as Ackenthorpe Hall Estate. They have to take cover from a groundskeeper walking a fierce-looking dog and Miss Marple concocts a plan, which she subsequently carries out, to take employment at the hall to further investigate, for she is convinced that the murdered woman's body is on the hall grounds.As she arrives by a car driven by Mr. Stringer at the hall (which appears to be right on the edge of town), we see it as past its best days but still nice. It sits on grounds of five or ten acres. We see the staff which consists of Mrs. Kidder who comes in three times a week to do the ""rough work"" and some cooking, a gardener and groundskeeper, Hillman, and now Miss Marple as the main house-keeper and cook. She is greeted by the daughter, Emma, of the owner, Mr. Ackenthorpe (James Robertson Justice) . Also living there is Emma's nephew who is visiting while on school holidays. Mr. Ackenthorpe is an irascible old man, an invalid who spends most of his time in his room. He sneaks cigars and booze against doctor's orders. There's a verbal exchange and Miss Marples gives as good as she gets.Settling in, she meets the nephew, fourteen year old Alexander Easley, a good natured but mischievous kid. He describes the future heirs to Mr. Ackenthorpe's estate: ""Uncle Harold, stinking rich and just as mean."" ""Uncle Albert, deadly dull, poor fellow."" ""Uncle Cedric who paints, but not for art's sake."" ""There was an Uncle Edmond who was killed during the war."" and then there's Alexander's father Brian Eastley, ""the WWII fighter ace"". His mother is dead.The other major character is Mr. Ackenthorpe's house-visiting physician, Dr. Quimper,who it is apparent has a romantic relationship with Emma.Next day on the job, she investigates the grounds under the guise of practicing golf. We learn she won the ""Ladies Open Handicap in 1921"". Alexander accompanies her as she explores the outbuildings. Inside are old carriages and buggies, and a room which contains some Egyptian artifacts. They also find a music compact, which we later learn had fallen from the murdered woman's clothing. ""Jane"" claims it as her own. Hillman arrives and runs them off before they can explore the Egyptian room. That night Jane sneaks out to the Egyptian room and finds the murdered woman's corpse hidden in a sarcophagus. She has Mr. Stringer anonymously inform the police.As Inspector Craddick and his Sergeant are investigating the scene, the doctor arrives and suggests that the woman is French because of the clothes she is wearing. Miss Marple tells the inspector in private that she is the one who found the body, and now she has his respect.A day or days later, we see the heirs at dinner, as they are visiting for a weekend. There are the four men plus Emma. We learn each of the sons and son-in-law has some intrigue going on. There's also speculation that the murdered woman could have been ""Martine"" a French woman they've never met who supposedly married the son who was killed during the war in France. Emma had earlier received a letter from this Martine saying she was going to visit. If this Martine had arrived and shown proof of the marriage, she would have been entitled to a share of the estate, thus each heir would have had a financial incentive to murder her.Next we learn that the compact has been stolen from Jane's room and thus it is believed that this was done by the murderer and her life may be in danger. It also turns out that old Mr. Ackenthorpe had had an attack of indigestion some months prior. The doctor had had some suspicion of arsenic poisoning but hadn't mentioned it to the police. Emma takes the letter she received from Martine to the police.That night, after supper, several of the members of the family get seriously ill, and one, Albert dies.The next night, Harold is found dead with a shotgun wound, on the grounds.The compact is found -- young Alexander has taken it -- thus ending that line of investigation but Miss Marple announces she thinks she knows who the killer is, and has a plan to catch him, which she gives to Inspector Craddock, but which is kept from us.That night, everyone is gathered in the drawing room, and Alexander comes in showing off the music box, which he says belongs to Miss Marple, and which he had borrowed and will drop off with her on the way to bed. Later, Miss Marple is in her bedroom, knitting, when the killer enters -- it is Doctor Quimper. He had a plan to marry Emma and acquire a share of the inheritance but he was already married (unknown to everyone), so he had murdered his wife. His suggestion that the murdered woman was French was just to throw off the police and direct suspicion on the rest of the family. Miss Marple gets him to confess as he doesn't intend to let her live, but the police are in hiding and prevent the murder. Doctor Quimper is placed under arrest.The next day, Jane is giving her notice to Mr. Ackenthorpe and he proposes marriage, which she declines.The movie ends with Mr. Stringer taking Miss Marple home in his car. Alexander has affixed a bunch of cans on strings to the rear bumper along with a ""Just Married"" sign to the rear trunk deck. Alexander laughs and waves as he runs after the car."

Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea,1961,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0055608/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"When the Earth is threatened by a burning Van Allen Radiation Belt, U.S. Navy Admiral Harriman Nelson plans to shoot a nuclear missile at the Belt, using his experimental atomic submarine, the Seaview. Admiral Nelson takes a brand new atomic submarine through its paces. When the Van Allen radiation belt catches fire, the admiral must find a way to beat the heat or watch the world go up in smoke.—<GM.Augusta@worldnet.att.net> US Navy Admiral Harriman Nelson evokes extreme views. Some believe he is the greatest scientific mind around, while others see him as a lunatic. His latest project, an atomic submarine, the Seaview, which he designed and built, is evoking as many divergent views. The Seaview is going through its final tests in the Arctic region. One day, the Seaview unexpectedly goes through a dangerous underwater ice shower - the ice pieces the size of large boulders - which Nelson and his crew ultimately learn is due to the Van Allen Radiation Belt being on fire, causing the break-up of icebergs on the surface. If the fire is not contained, it could mean the destruction of the Earth. At a UN meeting in New York to discuss what to do, Nelson states that he believes the fire will not burn out as many other scientists believe, and that he can extinguish the fire by shooting a missile at the belt in exactly sixteen days from the region of the Marianas Trench in the Pacific. His view is supported by his friend, fellow scientist, retired Commodore Lucius Emory. Unable to get orders for or against from the US government, Nelson proceeds to sail the Seaview to his intended destination, which is against the wishes of the UN. Despite being generally loyal to the admiral, many aboard the Seaview believe his action is irrational, foolish and/or reckless. Among those are: Captain Lee Crane, the sub's commanding officer; Dr. Susan Hiller, a visiting psychiatrist on board to do research of the effects of stress on the crew; and Miguel Alvarez, a civilian scientist and religious zealot, who believes that if the world is to end that it is God's fate. Caught in the middle is Lieutenant Cathy Connors, the admiral's secretary, who is still seemingly loyal to her boss, but who is also engaged to Captain Crane. These internal struggles are not the only obstacles Nelson faces, but also the regular perils of the ocean, the UN who they learn has issued a seek and destroy order of the Seaview, and a potentially mutinous crew, one of who seems to be sabotaging the mission even at the expense of some of the other crew member's lives.—Huggo The Seaview is an atomic submarine designed by Admiral Harriman Nelson. On its initial launch some politicians are visiting it to see if all the money they poured into it is worth it. It is while they are at sea that they learn that the belt of radiation covering the Earth is on fire. Nelson is asked to attend some kind of international conference to determine what to do. It is while on route that Nelson comes up with a plan which he presents at the conference. Nelson proposes that if an atomic missile is launched from the Seaview at a precise moment, it will cause it to blow up. Another scientist claims that the belt will burn itself out when it reaches a certain temperature. But Nelson says that if they wait for his proposal, they will miss the window of opportunity that he told them of. Nelson leaves, boards the Seaview, and heads off to make his rendezvous with radiation belt. However, Nelson's driven manner, causes friction between him and Captain Crane, whose relationship with him is more paternal. As they push on, some of the crew members don't want to follow the admiral, and if that wasn't enough, there appears to be saboteur on board.—rcs0411@yahoo.com The new, state of the art nuclear submarine Seaview is on diving trials in the Arctic Ocean. The Seaview is designed and built by scientist and engineering genius Admiral Harriman Nelson (USN-Ret) (Walter Pidgeon). Captain Lee Crane (Robert Sterling) is the Seaview's Commanding Officer. One of the on-board observers is Dr. Susan Hiller (Joan Fontaine), studying crew-related stress. The mission includes being out of radio contact for 96 hours while under the Arctic ice cap, but the ice begins to crack and melt, with boulder-size pieces crashing into the ocean around the submarine. Surfacing, Admiral Nelson and Captain Crane discover fire burning in the sky. After the rescue of a delta flow scientist, Miguel Alvarez (Michael Ansara), the sub receives radio contact from Mission Director Inspector Bergan at the Bureau of Marine Exploration. He advises that a meteor shower pierced the Van Allen radiation belt causing it to catch fire, resulting in a world-threatening increase in heat all across the Earth. Nelson's on-board friend and scientist, retired Commodore Lucius Emery (Peter Lorre) concurs that it is possible. Bergan informs Nelson that the President wants him at a UN Emergency Scientific Meeting as soon as possible.Nelson and Commodore Emery calculate a plan to end the catastrophe. The USOS Seaview arrives in New York Harbor in two days. At the meeting Nelson informs the UN that according to their calculations, if the heat increase is not stopped, it will become irreversible and Earth has ""a life expectancy of about three weeks."" The Admiral and the Commodore have come up with a plan to extinguish the Skyfire. He proposes firing a nuclear missile at the burning belt from the best calculated location, the Marianas. Nelson posits that when fired at the right place and time, 1600 hours on August 29, the nuclear explosion should overwhelm and extinguish the flames, away into space, essentially ""amputating"" the belt from the Earth. The Seaview has the capability to fire the missile.But the Admiral's plan is rejected by the chief scientist and head delegate, Emilio Zucco (Henry Daniell) of Vienna. His reasons are that he knows the composition of gases in the belt and he believes the Skyfire will burn itself out at 173 degrees. Zucco's plan is to let the Skyfire do just that and he feels the Admiral's plan is too risky. Nelson claims that Zucco's burn-out point, however, is beyond that date and time if the current rise rate is maintained. But at Zucco's urging, Nelson and Emery are shouted down and the plan is rejected. Despite the rejection, the Admiral and the Commodore quickly leave the proceedings, advising that his only authorization will be from the President himself.It is a race against the clock as the Seaview speeds to reach the proper firing position, above the trench in the Marianas in the Pacific. During this time Nelson and Crane agree on tapping the Rio-to-London telephone cable to try to eventually reach the President. However, an unsuccessful attempt on the Admiral's life makes it clear that there is a saboteur on board. But the confusion over who the saboteur might be revolves around rescued scientist Miguel Alvarez, who has become a religious zealot regarding the catastrophe, and Dr. Hiller, who secretly admires Dr Zucco's plan. Other obstacles present themselves: a minefield and a near-mutiny. And Crane himself begins to doubt the Admiral's tactics and reasoning. During the telephone cable attempt, Crane and Alvarez battle a giant squid. Although the London cable connection is made, Nelson is told there's been no contact with the States for 35 hours. Also, a hostile submarine follows the Seaview deep into the Mariana Trench, but implodes before it can destroy the Seaview.Near the end of the film the saboteur is revealed to be Dr. Hiller. Captain Crane happens by as she exits the ship's ""Off Limits"" Nuclear Reactor core, looking rather ill. She has been exposed to a fatal dose of radiation: her detector badge is deep red. Walking over the shark-tank catwalk, she falls in during a struggle with the Captain, and is killed by a shark. The Admiral learns that temperatures are rising faster than expected. He realizes that Zucco's belief that the Skyfire will burn itself out is in error.
At the end, Seaview reaches the Marianas. There, in spite of the threats and objections of Alvarez, Seaview launches a missile toward the belt and it explodes the burning flames outward, saving the world."

When Penny runs into her Father's CORPSE yet again, this time sitting upright in his study, Penny wonders if she's going mad. Penny begins to suspect her stepmother Jane and Dr. Gerrard. She's convinced they're having an affair and that they've killed her father, hiding his body somewhere in the house.With chauffeur Bob now an ally, Penny and Bob decide the body must be hidden somewhere in the house. Late at night, they locate a meat freezer, but when Bob pries it open, they do not find her Father's body. Only later, staring at the swimming pool, does Penny realize that the body might be kept down in the icy water. Bob dives into it, swimming through the weed-infested water, and indeed he sees the old man's dead eyes staring at him from his watery grave.Now, Penny and Bob decide to drive to the authorities, as Jane has left for the evening. Bob places Penny in the backseat of the limo and they start out. On a deserted road, they see Jane. Bob gets out of the car to talk to her, but the car begins to roll with Penny helpless in the backseat. Panicked, Penny leans across the seat to stop the car, and then sees her Father's CORPSE slumped down in the front seat. She screams before the car plunges into the waterBob and Jane, secretly lovers, have watched the whole accident. It was all a plot to make it appear as though Penny and her Father died in the same car accident, thus getting the estate for themselves.Jane gets a visit from her Father's SOLICITOR. When she inquires about the chain of inheritance, since both the Father and Penny were killed, the Solicitor is surprised. He says there was only ONE body in the car - the Father.

Before the Solicitor leaves, he points out the young girl at the edge of the cliff outside the house who's sitting in a wheelchair!Jane goes up to the wheelchair, and indeed it's Penny, still alive. But Penny reveals that she is not Penny at all. She is Penny's best friend, EMILY FRENCHEM. She's also not paralyzed, rising out of the wheelchair. Penny is the girl who committed suicide in France, the one whose body they dragged out at the beginning of the movie. Emily knew something was wrong at the estate because Penny's Father had called his daughter about it. That's why Emily came investigating, and now she knows the truth-Penny's Stepmother Jane and the Chauffeur murdered Penny's Father. Emily had aligned herself with Dr. Gerrard to trick Jane and Bob into revealing their guilt. She was able to leap from the car before it plunged into the water.Emily walks off to call the police, Jane sits wearily in the wheelchair. In the meantime, Bob, having found out Penny's alive, rushes into the house, searching for Penny. He sees the wheelchair, kicks it off the cliff, but, of course, it's Jane who falls to her death.

Victim,1961,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0055597/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A closeted lawyer risks his career to bring a blackmailer to justice. A plea for reform of England's anti-sodomy statutes, Melville Farr (Sir Dirk Bogarde), a married lawyer, tries to locate a blackmailer who has photos of Farr and a crying young gay man (who is being blackmailed and later commits suicide) in Farr's car. After the suicide, Farr tracks down other gay men being extorted for money by the same blackmail scheme. Worldly Police Detective Inspector Harris (John Barrie) considers the anti-sodomy law nothing more than a license to blackmailers, and eventually is contacted by Farr to capture the malicious blackmailer. The movie, far ahead of its time, ends with Farr and his loving wife coming to terms with his homosexual tendencies in advance of the public exposure he will face in the team of blackmailers' trial.—Mike Mills <mills@colorado.edu> ""Boy"" Barrett, a young English construction worker, is arrested for stealing a large sum of money from his firm. When he learns that the police know he used the money to pay a ring of blackmailers who threatened to expose him as a homosexual, he hangs himself rather than endanger the career of Melville Farr, a successful barrister with whom he had become emotionally, but not sexually, involved. Farr does become implicated, however, when the police discover that the blackmailers were using a photograph of them together to extort money from Barrett. Filled with remorse and angered by the existence of a law that makes homosexuals criminals, thereby making them easy prey for blackmailers, Farr decides to jeopardize both his marriage and his career by bringing those responsible for Farr's suicide to justice. Before his marriage Farr had admitted to his wife, Laura, that he had homosexual tendencies; now, forced to confess that these tendencies still exist, he offers Laura her freedom. Despite pressure from both the blackmailers and their victims, Farr cooperates with the police in tracking down the blackmailers--a sadistic young hoodlum, Sandy, and an embittered spinster, Miss Benham. Though fully aware that the scandal will ruin him, Farr insists upon prosecuting; as he prepares his case, Laura, who still loves him, realizes that her husband's need for her is stronger than any passing emotion he may feel, and she intimates that she will return to him when the trial is over. Jack Barrett (Peter McEnery) is found dead in his jail cell. He was being held for embezzling money from the construction company where he worked, and that he admitted to the Police to doing it. He committed suicide rather than admit the truth of why he took the money, because he was being blackmailed for being a homosexual, at a time in 1960s England when anti-sodomy laws were still in place. The other person involved and photographed with Jack, is married barrister Melville Farr (Sir Dirk Bogarde). Barrett tried to contact Farr, but the lawyer thought the young man was trying to blackmail him. Farr comes to realize that Barrett was trying to warn him. Farr decides to risk his own high standing in the community, and recent appointment to the Queens Council, by tracking down the blackmailer. Farr enlists the help of Barrett's gay friend Eddy Stone (Donald Churchill) to try to find someone else who is being blackmailed so he can make contact with the blackmailer. Farr knows his career is over if he involves the Police. Through this turmoil, Farr must deal with the fallout with his loving wife Laura (Sylvia Syms), who knew of her husband's tragic college homosexual experience before they were married. Farr discovers the blackmail scheme involves several acquaintances and gets an offer of assistance from sympathetic Detective Inspector Harris (John Barrie). Farr is challenged to find those responsible before anyone else is hurt and he breaks the law through his involvement with the embezzlers.—Huggo"

Top scientists at the Meteorological Center refuse to give any official explanation, which makes the newspaper editor suspicious. He orders science reporter Bill Maguire and alcoholic columnist Peter Stenning to dig for information. When Peter begins a romance with Met Center secretary Jeannie Craig, he learns from her certain clues that there has indeed been a cover-up, and he begins to sober up, so that he may win her love.

They also meet three more men named Judge Hamilton (Joby Baker), Larry Neal (Don Edmonds), and Wally Hodges (Bart Patton). Abby enjoys the fact that they will all be at the same hotel but Gidget barely reacts. Abby figures out that Gidget has just broken up and asks her to tell the story. Gidget does, but in an overly dramatic way. She says it was love at first sight then she went overboard and ""surrendered herself completely,"" which Abby misinterprets as ""she went all the way"". As the kids mingle, Gidget's parents and Abby's parents Monty Eddie Foy Jr. and Mitzi Peggy Cass are enjoying each others company.On the beach, Abby toys with all the boys' emotions, but appears to like Eddie best. Eddie, however, finds an interest in Gidget, who is still in a foul mood. Russ feels bad and decides to send a message to Jeff, suggesting that he come out to Hawaii to surprise Gidget and make her feel better. He immediately accepts.That night, Abby visits Gidget and invites her to dine with her and Eddie and the rest of the gang. Gidget declines at first, then agrees after her mother convinces her that she should enjoy her time there and have fun with Abby and the boys.At the restaurant, Abby is annoyed that she can't be alone with Eddie, so she finds two other girls named Barbara Jo Wells (Jan Conaway) and Dee Dee Waters (Robin Lory) to accompany them. At another table where Gidget's and Abby's parents are, Russ receives a telegram that Jeff is taking the first plane out to Hawaii. Gidget finally arrives, all dressed up, and joins the group.

Later that night, Abby lets Gidget know how annoyed she was about her making such an entrance.The next day, we see Gidget surfing with a very annoyed Abby (who is afraid of the water) looking on from the beach. The guys watch in amazement as Gidget shows off her surfing moves, prompting Eddie to ask her for surfing lessons.

For this, Gidget tries to make Jeff jealous by flirting with Eddie. The gang begins a conversation about things being tame with Judge suggesting to Gidget that she should try water skiing (which at the time was really risky).

Jeff soundly chides Gidget for letting the ""game"" get out of control, but he backs off when she tells him that she won't tolerate such a scolding from anyone...except a husband.Meanwhile, Abby is fed up with Gidget and decides to take her down a notch by spreading a wanton rumor about her. She implies to her mother that Gidget has slept with Eddie and other guys, rationalizing that it is half-true because Gidget had said that she gave herself ""completely to that Moondoggie person"". Mitzi relays this to Dorothy, who refuses to believe it. Even after Gidget herself denies even the thought of such a thing, arguments about it break out between the adults. Russ and Mitzi end up down at the hotel bar where they realize they see eye-to-eye on things; they decide to go to the Mauhana Room. At the same time, Monty and Dorothy (who had been talking upstairs in the hotel room) also decide to go to the Mauhana Room.At the Luau that night, Abby is the center of attention and is happy about it, especially since Gidget isn't there. Eddie decides to go for a walk and runs into Gidget. He tells her of the rumor then confesses he's in love with her. A crestfallen Gidget tells him that she doesn't love him but they agree to be friends. However, Gidget still can't bring herself to go to the Luau since she doesn't know how far Abby's rumor has spread, so she goes for a walk alone on the beach and pictures herself promiscuous and pregnant.Back at the Luau, Abby tells Jeff about the rumor that Gidget sleeps around, admitting that it's a lie and that Gidget only had one affair with a guy named ""Moondoggie"". Jeff then realizes how much he cares about Gidget, so he puts Abby in her place by telling her that he likes her and to call him what everyone at home calls him: ""Moondoggie"". Jeff and Gidget reconcile on the beach and head back to the hotel to straighten everything out with the adults. When the hotel clerk informs them that Russ and Mitzi left the hotel from one way and Monty and Dorothy left from another exit, Gidget and Jeff wait for them in her parents' suite.At the Mauhana Room, the adults also reconcile after discussing the situation; Mitzi assures Russ and Dorothy that Abby will be punished for her misdeed. They return to the hotel and find that Gidget is not in her suite. Word of Gidget's disappearance gets around to her friends and Abby, who shows deep regret for the trouble she has caused. Soon, everybody is gathered in Gidget's room; they express deep worry and concern, completely unaware that Gidget is just down the hall in her parents' suite with Jeff.Worried that her parents are cheating on each other, Gidget and Jeff make up a plan. As she and Moondoggie embrace and kiss on the couch, Russ enters and expresses shock, then relief. Gidget tells her father that Mom is asleep but she fixed it so his bed looks slept in; she suggests that he stay in Jeff's room for the night and come back in the morning so she won't suspect anything. Russ plays along and goes to tell Dorothy to ""get your half of what I got"". Gidget tells her mother the same thing she just told her father, but Dorothy goes into the bedroom anyway. To Gidget's surprise, her father is in bed and appears to be asleep. She taps him and he jumps up and yells ""Boo!"" Jeff and the rest of the gang come in. Gidget embraces Jeff and all seems to be well now...with the exception of some unfinished business which is taken care of the next day.In the final scene, the guys drag a screaming Abby into the ocean and place her on top of Gidget's surfboard. When the surf comes rolling in, Abby frantically clings on for dear life while Gidget and Jeff enjoy riding the waves."

Through everything, Kathy in particular holds steadfast to her faith in him, even when things logically don't add up to him being Jesus. Those things not adding up is because he is really Arthur Alan Blakey (Sir Alan Bates), wanted for murder. Kathy's faith affects what ultimately happens.—Huggo"
The Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone,1961,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0055382/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"An aging actress travels to Rome with her husband; after he suddenly dies during the flight, she begins a passionate affair with a young gigolo. Critics and the public say Karen Stone is too old -- as she approaches 50 -- for her role in a play she is about to take to Broadway. Her businessman husband, 20 years her senior, has been the angel for the play and gives her a way out: They are off to a holiday in Rome for his health. He suffers a fatal heart attack on the plane. Mrs. Stone stays in Rome. She leases a magnificent apartment with a view of the seven hills from the terrace. Then the contessa comes calling to introduce a young man named Paola to her. The contessa knows many presentable young men and lonely American widows.—Dale O'Connor <daleoc@interaccess.com> In Rome, the Contessa Magda Terribili-Gonzales is able to live a lavish lifestyle by foisting her small stable of young gigolos on wealthy and unsuspecting lonely women, or perhaps not so unsuspecting. She has a 50/50 agreement with those gigolos for any moneys received. One of those women is middle aged Broadway actress Karen Stone, who is at an age where she can no longer play the ingénue roles that made her famous. In combination with the recent death of her husband en route to Rome, Karen is feeling insecure in her career and life because of her age. The Contessa's choice for Karen is Paolo di Leo. Although Karen is wary of Paolo, her loneliness does get the better of her as she embarks on a relationship with Paolo. In her somewhat outward happiness, Karen begins to sever ties with her old friends, who she believes will be judgmental. But Paolo is slightly different than the Contessa's other gigolos. He in turn has an infatuation with Karen, who doesn't lavish him with money as do most of the other women. This lack of money places a strain between Paolo and the Contessa, who wants her fair share and will do anything needed to make sure Paolo does his ""job"", even at the expense of Karen's mental state.—Huggo"

DOCTOR BLOODS COFFIN-synopsisA surgeon is operating on a patient. He removes the lid from a container, and inserting a syringe, fills it from the contents. Professor Luckman (Paul Hardtmuth) enters and warns the surgeon he must not carry out the experiment. It is revealed that the surgeon, Dr. Peter Blood (Kieron Moore), was the brilliant and vain student of the professor but wanted to carry the experiments on animals further by involving humans. Peter insists the professor wanted to see the experiment go further but needed his help and inspiration. Luckman tells him that no one has the right to kill another for any reason and for him to get out. Peter is warned that he will be reported to the police if not. He leaves reluctantly.Peters father, Dr. Robert Blood (Ian Hunter), drives to work in the village of Porthcarron where a group of people have gathered. His nurse Linda Parker (Hazel Court) approaches the car and informs him that Hanson (John Ronane) is missing from the village and that Sgt. Cook (Kenneth J. Warren) wants to talk to him. He hands over the replaced supplies that were stolen from his office to Linda to carry in. As she enters the office, Peter is seen taking a bottle of glucose from the refrigerator. Because she almost caught him, he had to quickly hide behind a door. She enters and sees the fridge door left open. Looking around the office, she is unable to locate the bottle and goes outside to tell Dr. Robert, who announces the theft to the men discussing what has been happening. Peter watches from a window.It is suggested that the supplies may be hidden in the old tin mines which spread for miles. George Beale (Andy Alston) is nominated to lead a search of the tunnels since he is most knowledgeable. Seeing them coming, Peter retreats to his new laboratory in the mine tunnel where one or more bodies are waiting on slabs. He connects the bottle of glucose to one of them. He then prepares a syringe and takes a bottle of chloroform and his container of curare (which causes paralysis) and goes to the home of George, rendering him unconscious and injecting him.The used syringe falls to the floor and breaks. In the lab, as Peter turns out the light to leave, we see George looking around, though unable to move.The next morning Peter arrives at his fathers office and introduces himself to Linda. Once she realizes he is the son who was expected, she goes to announce him but is stopped by Peter who wants to surprise his father. Robert is seen playing chess with G.F. Morton (Gerald Lawson), the local undertaker. Peter knocks and enters and is greeted and introduced to Mr. Morton. Peter and his father discuss what Peter will likely do now and Morton leaves. Linda enters and announces Sgt. Cook wants to talk to them. Cook enters and is introduced to Peter. Cook produces the broken syringe and asks Dr. Robert to identify it and its contents. He announces the disappearance of George, saying it might be a kidnapping. Upon hearing that the culprit may be hiding in the tunnels, Peter offers to help search. He is careful to pick up the syringe so his fingerprints will be found but discounted since the police know he handled it.Peter directs the men into one of the tunnels and goes with Sgt. Cook into another. Telling Cook to search one tunnel, Peter goes in the other (heading for his lab). Meanwhile George having regained some mobility crawls through the tunnel to escape.Peter reaches the lab and sees that George is gone. He begins searching for him but is distracted by Cook who calls his name, causing him to miss seeing George. Having reached the connecting tunnel, Cook has summoned Peter, who reports he has seen nothing. They emerge and join the others who have also found nothing. Peter tells them they have covered every inch of the mines and goes to talk to Linda who is waiting in Dr. Roberts car. She tells him his father wants Peter to help identify what was in the syringe.They drive back to the office with Peter driving hurriedly. Linda begins talking about the mines, saying she has never seen the inside of them. Noticing Peter is distracted, she accuses him of not paying attention. She tells him she has never been inside the mines, to which he replies she would likely get lost.Dropping her off at her home, Peter drives to his fathers office. Meanwhile George is still crawling through the tunnels, trying to escape with all his might. That evening Peter rushes back to the mines to look for George.By morning George has made it outside. Peter emerges and begins searching along the shoreline. Peter is just about to discover George, who suddenly rolls downhill and is unnoticed.Returning to town, he passes Morton, who invites him to visit the mortuary again. He promises to do so and leaves.Entering the office cautiously, Peter sees Linda in the next room and takes flowers from a vase, pretending he picked them for her. She remarks how they look just like the ones she picked this morning. She tells him to take the tray of coffee in to his father, who is in with Sgt. Cook.Dr. Robert tells Peter he has only partially analyzed the compound and is unable to make any conclusion. Peter offers to take the sample to Plymouth Hospital for spectral analysis (hoping to give a false report) but is overruled by his father, who leaves right away with Cook walking him to his car. Peter asks for coffee and Linda comes back with a cup, serving it to him. She sees the container of curare and picks it up, asking what it is. Peter makes an awkward story about getting it from a witch doctor. When she asks what is in it, he puts his finger in and licks it, saying  pure honey.  She refuses to taste it, saying she is going to leave for the day.Suddenly Cook rushes in, calling for Peter to accompany him. He explains that George has been found. Peter, asking if he is alive, gets together a kit and asks Linda to bring adrenaline. He fills a syringe with curare for an injection. Getting into the police car, they drive off.On the way, Peter presses Cook for the condition of the patient. He wants to know what George said and if he recognized anyone. Cook says George was mumbling something but they couldnt understand what.When they arrive on location, George is mumbling weakly. Peter gives him an injection, causing him to collapse and die. He tells Cook he will do a post-mortem at the mortuary.George is laid out on a slab and Peter calls Morton from the other room. He tells Morton he is there to do a post-mortem and that no embalming must take place until after the autopsy is completed. Morton leaves and Peter prepares an injection of curare, giving it to George.Peter and Linda spend some time together, walking along the hillsides and talking. He begins ranting about how his professor prevented him from completing an experiment on skin grafting and saying no one would stand in his way. Linda suggests that he contact Plymouth Hospital as his father would have him. He asks if she is trying to get rid of him, which she denies. He tells her he hadnt planned on meeting her and they kiss, lying down.That night Peter returns to the morgue. Uncovering the body, we see that George is still alive but paralyzed. Peter goes quietly upstairs to where Morton is sleeping. Satisfied that Morton is sound asleep, Peter goes downstairs and prepares to operate. Meanwhile, Morton awakes and looks at his watch, going back to sleep.Peter prepares for surgery, removing the heart as George is still conscious. Knocking over a metal pitcher, Peter realizes this may wake Morton. As Morton goes downstairs to investigate, he sees that George is still alive. Peter tells him to go back upstairs. An argument ensues and Morton is pushed back onto the stairwell and dies. Georges heart dies and Peter is angry. He takes out a body box and places both bodies inside.The next morning Linda walks to work. Preparing the coffee, she calls upstairs to Peter. He walks in looking haggard and says he had to do the embalming himself and that Morton didnt show up. Lying down on a couch, he falls asleep from exhaustion.The next day Peter drives to Linda (who has the day off) and picks her up. They drive to the mines and he encourages her to go in. After ranting about his boyhood mine fantasies he tells Linda that she must remain there for all eternity. Just as she is getting afraid, Tregaye (Fred Johnson) appears, saying he has been living there for some time. He shows them the way out.Sgt. Cook enters the mortuary and looks around, going upstairs to Mortons quarters. Finding nothing significant he comes out just as Peter drives up to meet Linda. Cook asks what time Peter came to do post-mortem and is told 9:30 to quarter of 10. He wants to establish a time of the disappearance of Morton. Linda gets into the car and Cook tells him not to keep her waiting. As they drive past the mines, Tregaye is seen standing outside the entrance.A graveside service for George is conducted with a priest, attended by several people who then file out solemnly. Cook offers Peter a ride, but he says he is waiting for Linda. She is seen visiting the grave of her late husband Steve Parker. As they walk back, Peter asks Linda about the death of her husband.Tregaye is seen moving a wheelbarrow of dirt outside the mine when Peter approaches. He asks about working the mines and Tregaye says he still makes a meager living. Saying he might discover something valuable, he invites Peter to join him for some lunch.Meanwhile, Dr. Robert returns and finds Peter in the local pub. Bragging about the facilities at Plymouth, he urges Peter to go when he has time. When asked about the test, Robert reveals it was curare. Peter remarks that he was just talking with Linda the other day about curare that a former student had given him. Suddenly Sgt. Cook interrupts, telling them that Tregaye was found dead at the mine with a gashed head. Peter goes to determine time and cause of death. Dr. Robert informs Cook that the test revealed curare. Linda is shown thinking about this news.Peter is seen examining the body. Meanwhile Linda goes to the office library, looking for a book on poisons. Cook tells her he has it and is reading about curare. She takes the book and reads how it paralyzes when it reaches the bloodstream but is harmless when taken by mouth. Cook leaves to search the crime scene and Linda thinks about when Peter tasted of the curare (claiming it was honey).Dr. Robert enters the mortuary and talks to Peter about the death of George. The certificate (filled out by Peter) claims death by heart malfunction. Robert says he knew George for years and that his heart was in good shape. Peter swears that no curare was found in Georges system and that the certificate is correct. Robert suggests that maybe Peter made a mistake and that he should intern for a year at Plymouth Hospital. Peter is angry, ranting about how no one will be patronizing and ordering him around and he must be free to conduct his experiments. Cook enters and asks for the report on Tregaye. When given the report, Cook notes that it was multiple fractures and Peter says he was dead about three hours when the body was examined. Cook asks about George, whether curare was found and is told no. Peter suggests a retesting at Plymouth, but Cook says no and thanks him.The office phone rings and Linda answers, telling the caller that the doctor is not receiving calls this evening. She goes and tells Dr. Robert a lady called about her son. He is visibly upset about the conversation with Peter but gets up to go on call. She insists that he is too tired to go, suggesting that she will contact Peter.Linda walks over to the mortuary and walks in to find Peter preparing to inject curare into a live Tregaye. Horrified, she notices the open bamboo curare container. She looks at Peter with a knowing look and he also returns a sinister look. When she goes to leave, he stops her and explains that he was on the brink in Vienna of a great discovery but was stopped by his professor. He tells her that Tregayes heart will be used to give life to someone else who is more valuable to society. She tells him that no one should have to die and that no one should play God and decide who is to live and die. He demands that he have the right to decide because he is a scientist. She tells him that Lucifer wanted all attention for himself and was damned for it. She says that Peter wants everyone to bow down to him and that any body raised to life would not be alive but an evil creation. He admits that he will call upon evil to accomplish his purpose. He tells Linda that she still loves Steve and thinks of him as still alive. Suddenly a noise is heard and Peter rushes in to find Tregaye having knocked the curare container to the floor. When he goes back, Linda has left and runs back to the office.Peter takes the body to the mine. Sgt. Cook and Dr. Robert and Linda arrive at the mortuary to find it empty. Linda, finding the container on the floor, gives it to Cook, who tells Dr. Robert he will have to issue a warrant for Peters arrest.Cook is seen phoning for help to set up roadblocks. Meanwhile Peter, who has disinterred Steve Parker, prepares to operate. He cuts out the living heart of Tregaye (who is seen clutching the wooden operating table in pain) and implants it into Steves corpse.Linda is told to go home by Dr. Robert. She does. Meanwhile Peter tells the corpse (Paul Stockman) that he is Steve Parker. Repeating this, he commands the corpse to speak. When it answers  Linda,  Steve goes and fetches Linda and brings her to the mine to see his creation. Cook is seen calling a second time for reinforcements. He leaves the mortuary and, hearing some noises, he goes to Lindas, finding no one.Peter takes Linda to see the now resurrected body of Steve, who turns to look at her. She screams and tells Peter he hasnt brought back Steve, he has created a monster from hell. All at once Steve approaches to choke Linda, but Peter intervenes. The corpse turns on Steve and a massive struggle ensues. Chemicals are spilled onto the ground and vapors begin to fill the cavern. When the struggle is over, Peter is dead and the corpse has collapsed.Linda, who has escaped during the struggle, makes it outside and meets the search party and points the way for Cook and his men.

Creature from the Haunted Sea,1961,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0054768/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A crook decides to bump off members of his inept crew and blame their deaths on a legendary sea creature. What he doesn't know is that the creature is real. American crook Renzo Capetto sees a chance to make a bundle when a Caribbean island has a revolution. He plans to help loyalists (and the national treasury) escape on his boat, then kill the men and blame their deaths on a mythical sea monster. Trouble ensues when the _real_ monster shows up!—Paul White <pwhite@bigfoot.com> After the Cuban Revolution, the mobster Renzo Capetto and his lover Mary-Belle Monahan transport a group of exiled Cubans led by General Tostada to the United States with a Cuban treasure to finance a counterrevolution against Castro. However, Renzo and his gang formed by Pete Peterson Jr., Happy Jack Monahan and Sparks Moran, who is indeed the American Agent XK150, plan to steal the treasure from the Cuban people. They fabricate a sea monster to change the course to San Juan and kill Cuban soldiers. However they discover that the creature does exist and is attacking them all.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Inept government agent XK150 is on the trail of mobster Renzo Capetto, a Bogart wanna-be who is transporting General Tostada, a group of exiled Cuban nationals, and a large portion of the Cuban treasury out of Cuba. Renzo is also accompanied by Mary-Belle Monahan (an infamous gangster moll), Happy Jack Monahan (her dim-bulb gangster-in-training brother) and Pete Peterson Jr. (a hoodlum/animal impersonator). Agent XK150 assumes the identity of ""Sparks Moran"" and somehow convinces Renzo to add him to the gang. Renzo concocts a plan to ""invent"" a sea monster, so that the Cubans will allow him to change their course. The phony sea monster will allow him to eliminate a few of the Cubans, and get himself closer to the treasure. Unfortunately, someone else invented the monster first.—Robert Stanfield <rstanf1@tandy.com> CIA agent XK-150 (Robert Towne) is working undercover in a Cuba-like small Caribbean island nation that is undergoing a revolution when he discovers that notorious international playboy, promoter and mobster Renzo Capeto (Anthony Carbone) is planning something with a group of military types loyal to the deposed regime. XK-150 learns that the loyalists leader Colonel Tostada (Edmundo Rivera Alvarez) has liberated the contents of the national treasury and plans to flee the country with the money so that he and his fellow loyalists can plan a counter revolution. Capeto is providing the boat with which the Colonel, his men and the money can leave the island. So, XK-150 posing as Sparks Moran, a notorious gum machine burglar from Chicago, infiltrates Capeto's gang as he manages to get a job on board the boat. The other gang members include Capeto's lover Mary-Belle Monahan (Betsy Jones-Moreland) - a notorious moll who used to push hard drugs to schoolchildren. Her brother Happy Jack Monahan (Robert Bean)- a tennis bum and hired killer who has developed a muscle spasm in his cheek from watching too many Humphrey Bogart movies and finally Pete Peterson Jr. (Beach Dickerson) - Capeto's top henchman who was discovered at Jones Beach where he worked as a pickpocket and has an incredible ability to mimic animal noises.The gold is loaded onto the boat along with the Colonel and his soldiers and they set off headed for the United States. However, Renzo Capeto and his gang have other ideas. Sparks discovers that they plan to make up a story about the fantastical Creature of the Haunted Sea in order to persuade the Colonel to allow them to divert the boat towards San Juan. The Capeto gang will then bump off the Colonel and his men so that they can steal the money for themselves. Agent XK-150 constructs a radio out of hot dog sausages and pickled gherkins in order to relay a message about their plans to the CIA, but sadly has to eat it in order to avoid detection. The Colonel is suitably frightened by their stories of a legendary sea monster and agrees to the ship changing course. The gang's plan seems to be working as they begin to eliminate the Colonel's men and blame their deaths on the creature.However, unbeknownst to anyone aboard the boat the Creature of the Haunted Sea is actually real and following them. When the boat moors off a small, remote tropical island called Isla de Barracho (Island of the Drunk) deaths start occurring that have not been carried out by any of Capeto's gang. Once he realises that the creature is real Capeto is forced into a sudden change of plan. He evacuates his crew to the island and sinks the boat in 30ft of water so that he and has gang can wait the creature has moved on then use scuba gear to go and retrieve the gold.

Erik the Conqueror,1961,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0055022/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Two estranged brothers confront each other as rivals when war breaks out between Britain and the Vikings for control of England. In the 9th century, two Viking children, separated since their early childhood with one raised by the British and the other by Vikings, meet after nearly 20 years as rivals when war breaks out between Britian and the Vikings for control of England.—Anonymous A voice-over narrator explains that in the year 786 A.D., three large Viking ships landed in the British isles, heralding the beginning of an attempted invasion. More ships followed, and within a few years, an all-out war is instigated. King Harald, the only Viking chieftain interested in maintaining peace, makes a plea to King Loter (Franco Ressel). The English king sends Sir Rutford (Andrea Checchi), the commander of the British sea forces, to work out a deal with the Vikings. However, Rutford is not interested in making bargains, and stages a surprise attack on the Vikings, thus opening the movie. In the ensuing battle, many Vikings are killed, most of them women and children. King Harald and a few Vikings fight bravely, killing a number of English knights, but he himself is felled by an arrow fired by Rutfords chief assassin. During the battle, Harold's two young sons, Erik and Eron, are whisked away by one of his chiefs. But in the attempt to escape from the beach where the battle rages, Eron is rescued by a few Vikings along with some women and children, but Erik is left behind in the chaos.Later, King Loter arrives on the scene where he threatens to strip Rutford of his title and of his command of the sea forces for the indiscriminate killing of Viking women and children. But Rutford retaliates by having his assassin kill Loter with an arrow, and making it seem that a wounded Viking killed him. Loter's wife, Queen Alice (Francoise Christophe), is greatly distress by the sudden death of her husband, and wonders away. She finds the young Viking boy, Erik, on the beach hiding away from where the carnage happened. Figuring out that he's a Viking, the queen decides to raise Erik as her own son, and takes him back to her castle residence, not realizing that a small tattoo on the boy's chest is a family crest which adorns the chest of both boys. Eron, in the meantime, is returned to the land of the Vikings and vows to spend the rest of his life plotting revenge against the British for the death of his father, and brother.20 years later, the Vikings once again wage war against the British. The adult Eron (Cameron Mitchell), has fallen in love with a vestal virgin named Daya (Ellen Kessler), the identical twin sister of the vestal virgin Rama (Alice Kessler). But because of the pagan Viking custom, she is promised to the gods, and they cannot reveal their love out of fear of being executed. Eron knows that only a king is permitted to marry a vestal virgin, and so he plans to take advantage of the forthcoming war with England to prove his valor and leadership abilities.King Olaf, the leader of the Vikings, makes a pack with Iceland, Norway, and Sweden to form an alliance to invade Britain once again for control of the North Sea. Because of his old age and physical infirmity, Olaf determins that a younger man will have to lead the attack in his place. Olaf chooses Eron, but his choice is resisted by Garan, who fears that Eron will lose sight of the objective by seeking out personal glory. Garan wishes to be elected leader, and a vote by the 20 field chieftains is taken. When the vote is a draw, Olaf determines that they will have to fight to the death. In the ensuring swordfight, Eron is victorious, but refuses to kill his opponent, and asks Garan to lead with him side-by-side. Eron is clearly a man of passion and valor, and although hot-tempered, he has compassion. But his major flaw is that Eron is too trusting.In England, the adult Erik (Giorgio Ardisson) is appointed as Duke of Helford, and leader of the British sea forces, replacing Sir Rutford. Erik's first duty by his mother, Queen Alice, is to stave off the impending Viking invasion. But Rutford is jealous of the young man, and plots to sabotage the mission by planting a spy on board who will set fire to Eriks ship while at sea.The two Viking and English fleets meet in the North Sea, and a sea battle begins. The Vikings board Erik's flagship, just as the spy begins to set fire to it. In the battle, Erik and Eron meet and engage in a swordfight, neither of them aware of their blood kin relationship. However, as Rutford planned, Erik's ship catches afire, enabling the Vikings to advance upon England. Erik jumps overboard, and later washes ashore in Viking land. He is found by Rama, and is immediately smitten with him, but she does not understand the significances of the cross he wears around his neck, and especially when he asks her if she's an angel. Fearing discovery and execution for interaction with a male, Rama points Erik in the direction of a local Viking fishing village and agrees to secretly meet with him later. Because of his blond, Nordic features, Erik is accepted by the Vikings as a ship-wrecked fisherman. One of Erik's crewmembers, also shipwrecked, recognizes him and plots to help him escape when the time is right.Back in England, Sir Rutford proposes marriage to the queen. He accepts the fact that she cares nothing for him, but claims to see the marriage as an opportunity of uniting the country. However, it is apparent that he is only interested in becoming king for his own self-interest. Queen Alice immediately sees though his deception and refuses by saying. ""your ambition shows. It devours you.""When the Vikings arrive, Rutford grants them admission into the castle. Eron and his men take over with little difficulty, and Rutford is appointed Regent, with the objective of ruling in Eron's absence. Eron then takes Queen Alice as a hostage back to Viking land, promising to kill her if anybody in England rebels against Rutford or his men.In Viking land, Rama is assigned to look after the captive Queen Alice. Rama happens to notice that the queen also wears a cross, and she mentions this to Erik when they secretly meet again. Demanding to know the prisoner's name, Erik is shocked when Rama mentions that its his 'mother'. Erik surmises that his presence in Viking land is an act of fate to rescue his mother, and also find happiness with Rama.The next day, Eron and Daya are to be married, while Rama and Erik plan to take advantage of the ensuing ceremony to flee to England with Queen Alice. As Erik, standing anonymously among all the other Vikings, watches the wedding ceremony, is mistakenly believes that it is Rama who is being married. Enraged by this imagined 'affront', Erik confronts Daya, who doesnt know who he is, and as a result, gives his true identity away when Eron recognizes him. Erik is then locked away by Eron to be executed the following morning.After drugging the men who are guarding Erik, Rama explains to him that the woman he saw married was her twin sister, and not her. Erik is relived to hear this and escapes from his prison with Rama. However, Eron and a horde of Vikings give a pursuit. Chasing them across a rickety bridge, Eron nearly falls to his death. Encouraged by Rama, Erik, rescues Eron from certain death. Undaunted by this act of kindness, Eron continues to peruse them, but Erik and Rama, meet up with Queen Alice and they safely sail away back to England.Upon their return, Erik is pleased to discover that the Scots have volunteered to help defend England against the Vikings. Before Erik and his combined English-Scots forces can attack the castle and reclaim it from Rutford, Eron and the Vikings arrive. Eron leaves Daya in Rutford's castle, while he accepts a direct challenge from Erik. In the ensuing swordfight, Eron catches sight of the tattoo on Erik's chest. Recognizing it as the same mark which adorns his chest, he comes to finally realize that Erik is really his long-lost brother.Reunited with his brother, Eron declares a ceasefire. This upsets Rutford, who respons by having his henchman fire an arrow at Erik. Eron throws himself in the path of the arrow, and is fatally wounded. The enraged Vikings attempt to storm the castle, but Rutford raises the drawbridge, and promises to kill Daya by the next morning if the Vikings to not disband.As Eron lies dying, he names Erik as his successor as King of the Vikings. Becoming more and more delirious, he asks to see Daya one last time. Erik determines to do this by breaking into the castle and retrieving her. With the help from Viking arch men, Erik begins to slowly scale a wooden tower alongside the cliff waterfront of the castle, as the Vikings shoot arrows into the wooden frame which he uses as grappling instruments. When Rama realizes that the dying Eron will not last much longer, she poses as her sister to him. Eron is oblivious to the deception, and upon declaring his love for her, he finally dies.In the meantime, Erik has scaled the wall, and makes his way into the castle. He rescues the captive Daya, killing Rutford's henchman guarding her. At dawn, the combined Viking, English and Scots armies attack the castle. Despite heavy casualties, the Vikings succeed in scaling the walls, and fighting the defenders. Eron manages to fight his away out of the castle and lowers the drawbridge, allowing the rest of the armies to advance into the fortress. All of Rutford's men are killed with Rutford himself being the last to fall when he attempts to shoot an arrow at the escaping Eron, and he is pierced with at least a dozen arrows by the Vikings and falls off the castle rampart to his death.With peace restored, Queen Alice reclaims her throne and allows Erik to leave England to claim his title as King of the Vikings. Erik returns to Viking land with Rama, while the dead Eron is also returned to Viking land with the mourning Daya to have a traditional Viking burial."

However, the spy went to inform Karabine's men discreetly while the gang along with Snowy the Dog (French: Milou) goes to the Greek capital to seek info. At one point, Tintin recognizes one of Karabine's henchmen seen in Istanbul, and along with a local, goes to a nearby village to pursue discreetly the bandits.At the village, Tintin and Snowy fetch for some clues as Haddock and the Thompsons are in a middle of a traditional Greek wedding party, where Angorapoulos is playing clarinet with the gang. However, Tintin recognizes him and tries to reach, but the villains take over the musician and drive him away. As the car is not available, Tintin takes a motorbike with Haddock and Snowy and pursues them. The car misses a turn and crashed on rocks. As the Karabine gang flees the car on fire, Tintin saves the poor musician in time from the burning wreck.Trying to question the musician who remembers absolutely nothing from the past, a simple bribe makes him remember that he, Paparanick and his gang were involved in this coup, and there was gold involved. He also mentions the fifth person is a reclusive monk, named Father Alexandre, living in a monastery in the Meteor mountain range. As they leave him away, Tintin and Haddock continue their journey to the Meteor mountains.After a rough trek, the duo arrive at the monastery and meet Father Alexandre, which remembers the coup and also mentions that they stole gold from a bank in Tetaragua before leaving after 11 days in power, before being overthrown by a guerrilla. He told that Paparanick took half of the loot and the rest was shared with the others. He remember also that Karabine was not happy with the share and wanted to do everything to get it for himself. However, a few days before he left for Turkey, Paparanick left him a bottle of alcohol, which he kindly gives to Haddock, as the monk does not drink anymore. Tintin and Haddock leave him in peace.On the way back, Haddock breaks the bottle by accident, and Tintin finds there is a map in the back, mentioning the location where the gold bars are. Back in Piraeus, where they picked up the Thompsons on the way (they were punished by the motor bike owner for KP as they were partly responsible for his stealing), they meet professor Calculus (Tournesol), who wanted to test his fuel booster pill that he invented. And the occasion is there since Tintin discovers the hefty Karexport spy who was emptying the fuel in the tanks and throws him out after a big fight. As Haddock finds out there is not enough fuel to go to the treasure site, Calculus convince him his fuel booster would compensate for the loss, which it does, and with a red smoke coming from the chimney, the ship goes to the location of the gold case.On location, Karabine's helicopter flies over them and lands on the island nearby. While the gangsters sneak in the back of the ship to surprise the crew, Tintin goes underwater and finds the crate with the gold bars. However, when he is back, a Karabine henchman welcomes him, while the rest of the crew is locked in the captain's cabin and Snowy attached to a pillar on the deck. Tintin is apparently shot by one of them and falls into the water. Karabine orders his men to blow up the ship with dynamite ignited with a fuse.While the crew is trying to get out of the locked cabin and Snowy chewing on his cord, Karabine and his henchmen are trying to reach the helicopter with the crate. However, policemen of Interpol along with the Thompsons, arrive to arrest the henchmen, but not before a firefight. Karabine goes alone in the helicopter leaving his gang with the cops, but was surprised by Tintin, who subdued the original pilot. Both are fighting until Karabine is knocked out partially, but not before sending the crate by a trap under the helicopter, sending it in deep sea.When the helicopter lands, Karabine and his gang are arrested. Haddock discovers that one of his crew is an undercover cop named Attila, who did made the phone call in Piraeus earlier, and was on the lookout for Paparanick and Karabine regarding the lost gold smuggled from Tetaragua. Though he was told the gold is lost at sea, Calculus with his pendulum examines the bars on the ship and discovers something special. Tintin remembers in the late captain's will that the ship is a ""jewel of the sea"" and as he scratches the apparent oxidation, he finds that the bars are made of real gold, and those in the crate are made of copper. The crew celebrates the finding.A few weeks later in Marlinspike (Moulinsart), Haddock has received a message from the Government of Tetaragua, thanking him for the gold restitution and making him a member of a supreme order. The postman also brought the local band to celebrate with champagne.At the end, Calculus invents an helicopter for the parrot that Haddock brought from the ship, telling the story is over...The end credits show art from Tintin's author, Hergé."

When he finally meets her, he winds up involved in a Satanic cult. Rick Turner is engaged of Donna Trent and is having nightmares with a beautiful blonde woman dancing in the sky. One night, he is mysteriously driven to a doll shop, and in the next morning he returns to the place with Donna.

Rick looks for Bianca and is seduced and convinced by her to join a sect that worships the diabolic Camba, while the health of Donna is threatened by Francis and Bianca.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil THE DEVILS HANDDonna Trent (Ariadna Welter) is feeding ducks in the local park. Rick Turner (Robert Alda) approaches and remarks about her friends (the ducks). She says she has been waiting and that she shouldnt marry someone who is always late. He reassures her that she has been waiting years for the right man and can wait another twenty minutes. Turning away, he appears concerned. She asks whats wrong, to which he answers nothing. I didnt get any sleep last night. She suggests he see a doctor or get sleeping pills. He says it wouldnt help. He also informs her that he has quit his job. She is surprised and reminds him that he wanted the job so he could develop his own interests and provide security for their pending marriage. He asks for her patience.That night Rick is troubled in his sleep. He awakens in the dark to see the vision of a woman dancing in the clouds. The image fades and he dresses and goes out for a walk. We hear his thoughts as he confesses the same woman appears every night in his dreams, becoming more real each time and leading him to a certain location. He is drawn like a magnet to a courtyard of shops where he spies a doll in the window looking exactly like the woman.Rick shows the doll to Donna the next day, explaining it looks like the woman in his dreams. She remarks that its likely a coincidence and that they can ask who posed for it. At this moment a man inside, Francis Lamont (Neil Hamilton), takes up the doll. They enter the shop where the man calls him Mr. Turner and says he has the doll ready for him. Rick looks bewildered and Donna looks at him puzzledly. He is surprised and remarks that the man knows his name. Lamont assures him that he knows his customers well and shows them the photo Rick brought in to make the doll. Rick says there must be some mistake. Lamont goes to the back to check the order. He assures Donna that he didnt order any doll and she says its probably a misunderstanding. He protests that he doesnt sleepwalk and is not living a double life.Suddenly Donna notices another doll on a shelf that looks like her. She picks it up and thanks Rick for having it made. He confesses that he didnt have anything to do with it. Lamont returns and says the order is complete, signed by Mr. Turner. Rick asks about the doll resembling Donna and is told it was ordered by the woman in the photo. Lamont takes the Donna doll and says he knows the lady who ordered it. Rick says there must be some mistake; he didnt order the doll and has never been in the shop. Lamont tells him the doll is paid for and that he will send it to the lady, Bianca Milan (Linda Christian). Rick asks to buy the Donna doll but is told that it is not for sale. Lamont suggests a photo be brought in so that a doll may be made in Donnas image. Donna insists that the doll is her image. Lamont looks at her and says irately   No, it is NOT!   Donna is incensed and leaves.Lamont takes the Donna doll back and downstairs to a chamber where a man beats drums. Putting on a mantle, he takes a voodoo pin and stabs the doll. At this moment Donna feels a pain in her stomach and is helped to the car by Rick. He takes her to Belmont Hospital. Lamont comes back to the shop with the pierced doll and pins it to the wall on the shelf.At the hospital, the doctor (Roy Wright) comes out and tells Rick that Donna has a problem with a muscle spasm near the heart. Rick remarks that it came on suddenly. The doctor admits that the whole thing is somewhat suspicious and suggests that she is resting now, sedated, and that Rick can see her tomorrow.That night, Rick is awakened by the image of Bianca calling his name. She speaks to him and he rubs his eyes bewilderedly. Asking what she wants, he is told that she wants him. She tells him to come to her and vanishes.The next day the nurse (actress not identified) tells Donna that Rick can only stay three minutes or she will get too excited. Donna says she always gets excited when she sees Rick. The nurse agrees and admits Rick to the room. Donna tells him she feels like a steamroller ran over her. He confesses another dream with the woman talking to him. He tells Donna that he must see the woman and find out the truth. She believes him and warns him to be careful.Going back to the doll shop, Rick asks to see the name on the back of the photo of Donna. Lamont explains that the doll and picture were picked up by the owner that morning. Rick asks for the other doll and is presented with it, completely wrapped with the address on it. Reassuring him the doll is completely paid for, Lamont gives it to Rick. After Rick leaves, Lamont looks over to the shelf where the Donna doll is still pinned to the wall.Rick knocks on an apartment door and it is opened by Bianca, who calls him by name and invites him in. He gives her the doll and she opens it up, remarking how much it looks like her. She offers him a drink. He says he wants answers. She tells him there is plenty of time and he pours a drink. They sip their drinks and she mentions eating. She rings a bell and explains that her servant will prepare it. She explains that her servant lost his tongue as a sacrifice in a group that worships an ancient deity. As they take seats at the table, he asks how she knew he was coming. She tells him that she invited him, and he came. It was a matter of thought projection, she tells him. He is surprised that she was able to project her thoughts and images from her apartment to his.After dinner they take coffee on the sofa and he asks her why she chose him and such a strange manner of contact. She states simply that she wanted him and has been working to wear down his resistance. He tells her that he is going to be married. She says that she always gets what she wants and moves to kiss him. Rising, he asks more about the thought projection. She rings for the servant and asks for drinks for them. As the drinks are brought, she opens a cabinet and produces a doll of Rick. He recognizes his image and she places it on an altar. They drink their drinks and she tells him to sit and relax. She lights a candle and kneels before the doll and focuses her attention on it. Rick closes his eyes and she tells him to look and describe what he sees. He tells her of a vision of her in clouds surrounded by storms. She tells him to turn and look at her. He says he knows what she is: a sheena; a witch. She tells him she belongs to a cult that worships Gamba and that she can control her destiny. He confesses that he is strongly drawn to her and that she is definitely a witch. They embrace and she tells him he must swear an oath to Gamba that night. Taking the doll of him, they leave to go to a ceremony at midnight.The servant drives them to the doll shop where Bianca hands the dolls to Lamont, telling him that Mr. Turner wants to join them. He says he will perform the ceremony after the sacrifice. They go back to the ceremonial room, where a number of people are seated on pillows. The voodoo drums play ominously. A woman rises and begins dancing to the drumbeat. Bianca explains that it is the full moon and a human sacrifice must be made. She points out a wheel above with apparent blades hanging down. One of the blades is real and the others not. The wheel is spun and lowered on the sacrifice. If the blade pierces the heart, Gamba has chosen. If not, the sacrifice is spared. She tells him all must pass a loyalty test this way and that she has been proven loyal.The dancing ends and Lamont comes out in ceremonial robes carrying the two dolls. He places them on a high shelf alongside dolls representing others in the room. One fat man, Lindell (actor not identified), is seen nervously operating a hidden camera inside his coat. Lamont announces that Gamba the great devil god calls for a sacrifice. They bring in a girl who appears to be in a trance and lay her on the altar. Lamont gets a striped pole and begins spinning the wheel containing the knives. The wheel stops spinning and Lamont operates a lever which lowers it close to the girl. Suddenly it drops into position. The girl has been spared; Gamba has protected her. Those present praise Gamba.The girl is released and leaves. Bianca tells Rick that it is their turn. Lamont tells them to kneel and asks Bianca if Rick has been informed of their beliefs. She assures him that he has. Rick is asked if he pledges himself to serve Gamba, if he will obey Gamba no matter what and if he will keep the cult in secret from others. All of which he answers that he will. Bianca is charged with being his sponsor; she agrees. He is pronounced a member by Lamont and they leave. Lindell nervously marks something inside his coat.Back at the apartment, Rick relaxes on the sofa. Bianca comes in and tells him that although he does not fully believe, she will bring him in and that he cannot ever escape from her. He confesses that he wants it that way.Next they are seen at the horse races, where they win eight races in a row. Rick visits a broker, who has been successfully investing according to tips from Rick. Rick credits Bianca as his advisor.Returning at night to his own apartment building, he finds a note on his mailbox from Donna, telling him how much she misses him and wants him to visit her. Smiling, he wads up the note.Lamont is seen having a drink with Bianca. He tells her that Rick has successfully completed all tests so far and that her relationship with him has lasted longer than previous relationships. She professes her allegiance to Lamont and he urges her to keep the affair brief. Next, Rick will have the loyalty test.As he goes out to his car that night, he is approached by a blonde member of the cult (Jeanne Carmen as Jeannie Carman) who appears to be drunk but wants to talk in private. They go up to his apartment where she wants a drink but he offers her coffee. She confesses she wishes she were free from the cult and wants her life back. Rick tells her she is drunk and doesnt know what she is saying. Finally he urges her to leave.At Biancas apartment, Rick fixes drinks for them and confesses that a female cultist may be unfaithful. Bianca tells him that he must report her or they both will be punished.Waiting at the doll shop, Lamont comes out with the blonde cultist and informs Rick that he has passed the loyalty test. He asks Bianca to come to the back with him, leaving Rick alone in the shop. He begins looking at the dolls and finds the Donna doll with the voodoo pin through it. Before he can do anything, Lamont and Bianca return. He steps back where he was and they suspect nothing.That night in his bed, he thinks about Donna and looks at her picture. The next morning he visits her in her hospital room. He tells her that at midnight she will be free of her illness and to trust him. Donna tells him that the nurse is no longer on her case but a new nurse is now. As Rick leaves, the new nurse watches him carefully.At Biancas place she and Lamont discuss whether Rick can be trusted any further. The new nurse Mary (Gere Craft) reported that Rick came to visit Donna. Bianca recommends that Donna be eliminated.Rick goes to the shop to remove the pin, but hesitates. Meanwhile, Lamont suggests that they wait a few days and see what happens. Bianca agrees and Lamont leaves, saying he has to return to the shop for something.Back at the shop, Rick removes the pin from the doll at midnight and tries to stick it back into the wall underneath the dolls arm. The doll sags down, so Rick uses some tape to hold it up. As he is leaving, he sees and hears Lamont coming. He goes to the ceremonial room to hide. Lamont enters the shop and hears noises coming from the ceremonial chamber. Rick operates the foot levers that raise the spinning wheel. Pulling the curtains down, he finds a doorway and enters in. Lamont comes into the ceremony room and looks around. On the floor he finds a note written to the newspaper editor, promising photos and names of the cult.At the hospital Donna receives a call from Rick. She tells him the pain is gone and she feels fine, other than being a little weak. Mary enters with a tray of coffee and sets it down. Donna asks Rick if she will see him again. Her reaction shows the answer is no. She hangs up and the nurse asks how she feels. Donna lies down and the nurse goes out to call Bianca.When Rick sees Bianca at her apartment, they have a drink and talk. She informs him that his association with Donna could be misconstrued. He assures her that it is over between him and Donna. Bianca questions that and Rick moves in to kiss her. He confesses that his love and desire for her is like an addiction that he never wants to lose.That night at the ceremony, Lamont announces that there is a traitor among them and that Gamba will have retribution at midnight. They are told to return at 12:30. Lindell looks nervous.Driving in his car afterward, Lindell looks cautiously behind him. Rick looks at the clock at Biancas and notices it is five minutes before midnight. At the ceremonial chamber Lamont selects the doll of Lindell and sticks it with a pin in the head. He places it in an incense burner. At the same time, Lindell cries out in pain and his car goes over a cliff, crashing and burning.As the cult members return to their places, Lindells sponsor (Bruno VeSota as Bruno Ve-Sota) looks nervously at the spot where Lindell sat earlier. Lamont announces that Gamba has taken revenge and the traitor Lindell eliminated. He was planning an exposé of the cult.As cult members leave, Lamont detains Lindells sponsor and speaks to him from the podium. The sponsor insists that he knew nothing of Lindells plan and that he also had been lied to by Lindell. Lamont shows him the paper that was found. The sponsor nervously looks it over and apologizes again. Lamont asks him to retrieve his doll from the shelf. The terrified sponsor backs away and falls over pillows.Lamont answers the phone in the doll shop. It is Mary, who is calling for Bianca. She informs Bianca that Donna has been released and that Rick has just come to pick her up.Bianca picks up the Donna doll and sees that the pin was removed. She shows it to Lamont, who asks what she wants to do. Bianca tells him she has her own plans for the doll.Rick and Donna get into Biancas car and he tells her that she must leave town and go far away for her own safety and his sake. He is unable to explain why. She reluctantly agrees and they drive off.Bianca has the doll at her apartment and sets it up. She begins calling Donnas name as Donna is packing to leave. Hearing the voice, Donna sits and responds.At the ceremony, a man and woman do a ritual dance. Rick approaches Bianca, asking where she has been for several hours. She tells him she has been busy. They take their places as Lamont calls for a sacrifice to be made. They bring in the subject. Rick notices that it is Donna. He comes forward and claims he has done nothing disloyal. He denies removing the pin from her doll. Lamont says Gamba will decide if he is guilty or not and that he must spin the wheel. Very reluctantly he spins the wheel. Lamont operates the pedal to lower it.Rick blames Bianca and denounces the cult as murderers. He grabs Donna from the altar and puts her to one side of the room. A struggle breaks out between Rick and Lamont. The censer falls, igniting the curtains. Rick forces Lamont onto the altar, where the wheel falls, killing him. The fire spreads as cultists try to escape. Bianca picks up the Donna doll and leaves.Rick and Donna get into the car and she asks how she got there. He tells her that what matters now is that they are both safe and free. They drive away as the building burns.Bianca is seen in a vision as if responding to what Rick has said. She says   thats what he thinks."

Bert and the seven who are sent on the service calls by the elderly office manager, Miss Cooling, get into one misadventure after another due to the nature of the calls, some of the work not being quite what they expect, some disorganization, some confusion, some misunderstanding, and/or more often than not pure ineptitude on their part. But when the agency is in jeopardy of closing for no fault of their own, they may face their biggest service challenge, completing the work to the client's satisfaction which may mean staying open or closing for good.—Huggo Down at the local labor exchange, everyone is moaning about the lack of decent jobs, unaware that nearby Bert Handy (Sid James) and his secretary Miss Cooling (Esma Cannon) are attempting to fill vacancies, at a new enterprise called Helping Hands.

He thinks he's on a top-secret spying mission but due to a mix up all that is required of him is to make up a game of bridge.

Sam's next job is at an exclusive men's club, where no matter how hard he tries he can't keep silent, which is a strict rule of the establishment.Miss Cooling decides on a new filing system, for a more streamlined operation and job cards are put in proper holes for each of the workers. Disaster strikes when the cleaner knocks the box down and puts the cards back all mixed up. Everyone gets someone else's assignment, with misunderstandings all round.

Due to a show of unity by all the staff, the landlord agrees that they can stay, on the provision that they do something for him.

As the morning wears on and as Fordyce follows Hepburn's unbending instructions ""or else"", Fordyce may have some issue carrying out those instructions because of the strained relationship he has with his staff.—Huggo It is the morning of 23rd December at the City & Colonial Bank in Haversham, England, and the staff are arriving for work. They make small talk and contribute to a collection for their Christmas party that evening. When manager Harry Fordyce [Peter Cushing] arrives, he cleans the bank plaque outside and then, after entering the bank, points out that Christmas cards should not be out on display. He inspects the bank to ensure everything is clean and in place and reprimands chief clerk Pearson [Richard Vernon] because the nib of a pen is not in optimum condition.
Fordyce calls Peter [Barry Lowe] into his office to question him about an irregularity in the balance of his till. Peter protests his innocence but Fordyce is suspicious that Peter may have deliberately falsified the books with Pearson. Peter claims it was all an innocent mistake and the money was later returned. Fordyce questions Pearson about it too. Pearson is more relaxed compared to Fordyce's strict personality and following the accusation Pearson requests a transfer to another branch. Fordyce refuses, claiming it would be dishonest given this irregularity in the books and suggests he may even have to sack Pearson, which would ruin Pearson's career.
When the bank opens for business, the first person to arrive is Colonel Gore Hepburn [Andre Morell] who asks to see the manager. Fordyce reluctantly agrees so Pearson shows him into Fordyce's office. Hepburn tells Fordyce and Pearson he is from head office, specifically the bank's insurers, and it is his job to visit the banks to ensure that all proper security is in place. Hepburn reprimands them for letting him in to the manager's office without checking who he is first, saying he could be a gunman. Fordyce and Pearson agree to be more vigilant next time and Pearson leaves the office. Fordyce tells Hepburn he is thinking of letting Pearson go, and Hepburn expresses surprise and says he knows how long Pearson has worked at the branch.
Fordyce's telephone rings. It is his wife; she sounds desperate and tells Fordyce to ""do whatever he tells you"" before Hepburn cuts the call off. Hepburn tells Fordyce there are two men at his house with his wife and child and they will electrocute his wife if Fordyce does not comply with his demands. Hepburn tells Fordyce to call Pearson in, and instruct him to move Hepburn's car into the car park and bring his luggage in.
After the luggage has been brought in, Miss Pringle [Edith Sharpe] brings in some tea. Hepburn asks her if they are having a Christmas party and gives her a £5 donation towards it. After she has left, Hepburn asks Fordyce if he ever contributes to the Christmas party but Fordyce says he does not ingratiate himself with his subordinates. Hepburn tells him he does now and demands his £5 back.
Hepburn and Fordyce leave the office to inspect the bank's alarm system. They check the alarms at the tills of Peter and Sanderson [Norman Bird]. After they have moved on, Sanderson asks Pearson if he has checked with head office if Hepburn is really who he says he is. Pearson hasn't, so Sanderson makes the telephone call to head office. However, the lines are busy and he can't get through so he asks to be called back.
Back in the manager's office, Fordyce tries to convince Hepburn that the bank does not hold a lot of cash in stock. Hepburn slaps Fordyce and tells him this operation has been a year in the planning and he knows they have about £97000 in stock to pay various company wages before Christmas. Hepburn explains his plan for going to the strong room, but before they go Hepburn asks for a drink. While they have a whiskey each, Hepburn points out the uncharitable characteristics of Fordyce's personality. Fordyce tries to defend himself and becomes angry but Hepburn quickly defuses the situation and ensures Fordyce can repeat the plan for going to the strong room.
They call Pearson in to go to the strong room together because Pearson and Fordyce each have one of the two required keys. Pearson switches off the magic eye alarm system and they go downstairs. Fordyce and Pearson unlock the strong room door and Hepburn pretends to start his inspection. They dismiss Pearson and once he has returned upstairs, they retrieve Hepburn's luggage from Fordyce's office. The bags are full of books which Hepburn empties out while Fordyce tries to open the safe. Initially, in his panic, Fordyce is unable to remember the combination but manages to compose himself and after a few attempts he opens it. They take out the wads of money and pack them into Hepburn's bags. Unknown to Fordyce, Hepburn slips one of the wads of money into Fordyce's suit jacket pocket as they pack the last bag.
As they exit the strong room, they forget to close the inner door before they close the outer door. A light flashes to indicate they only have 30 seconds to reopen the outer door and close the inner door before the alarm goes off. Fordyce starts to panic but just manages to unlock the outer door in time to close the inner door before the alarm sounds. They quickly return to Fordyce's office with bags.
Hepburn explains to Fordyce it is now time for him to leave. He says one of his accomplices will be watching the bank, and if there is any sign of the police or any alarms for one hour, they will kill Fordyce's wife. Meanwhile, back behind the tills, the telephone call from head office has finally come through but gets cut off before Peter or Pearson can verify Hepburn's identity. Peter brings Hepburn's car back to the front of the bank while Fordyce helps Hepburn out with his bags. Hepburn drives off and as Fordyce returns to his office the telephone call from head office comes through again, which Pearson answers. Pearson enters Fordyce's office and confronts Fordyce, asking what is going on. Head office has confirmed Hepburn was not genuine and Pearson is suspicious of Fordyce's nervous behaviour. Fordyce tries to protest his innocence but Pearson knows now the bank has been robbed. Fordyce finally admits what has happened but explains he is unable to do anything because his wife and child are being held hostage. However, Pearson has already rung for the police. Fordyce begs him to stop them but Pearson says all the other staff also know what is happening because they heard Pearson call the police. Fordyce says the staff must help him because his family are all he has got.
The police arrive: Det. Sgt Collins [Charles Morgan] and Det. Constable Kane [Alan Haywood]. Fordyce claims there has been a mistake and Pearson goes along with him, saying they made a mistake with Hepburn's identity and there is not a large sum of money missing after all. Peter also joins in, saying it was partly his fault for not telling Pearson and that Pearson panicked. They say if Hepburn is stopped, the entire bank staff will be in trouble for their mistake. While the constable goes back out to radio through the mistake, Fordyce invites the Sergeant into his office for a drink since it is Christmas time. Fordyce nods his thanks to his staff who have supported him.
As Fordyce and the Sergeant have a drink, Fordyce is on edge but the Sergeant explains they arrived without any sirens. He also mentions they have a new Inspector who was very keen to get going when the call came in from Pearson. As the Sergeant goes to leave Fordyce's office, Det. Inspector Mason [Kevin Stoney] arrives with Hepburn in handcuffs, much to Fordyce's shock. Fordyce still tries to maintain that Hepburn is with the bank's insurers at head office and there has been a mistake and he can vouch for Hepburn. However, the police bring in Hepburn's bags and open them to reveal the money. Hepburn says he and Fordyce planned it together. Mason has arrested Hepburn before so the Inspector accuses Fordyce of being involved as an accomplice. Fordyce breaks down and explains he was forced into it and his wife is being held hostage. Mason calls Fordyce's home number; his wife and son are there and everything at home is fine and they have not been held hostage. Fordyce still tries to protest his innocence but while trying to explain, the wad of money falls out of his pocket. Mason wants to take Fordyce and Hepburn to the police station but before they leave, Hepburn explains the voices of Fordyce's wife and child on the phone were false ones on a tape recorder. Hepburn says his accomplice is not Fordyce because he would use a better man than that. Fordyce still has to go to the police station to make a statement but before they leave, Fordyce calls Pearson over. Fordyce now realises how he has treated the others badly and admits failing completely in his duties. He thanks Pearson and says he will see him later at the Christmas party. At the door of the bank, Fordyce turns and again acknowledges the support his staff have shown him."

A woman disappears and suddenly her pet cat seems to harbor ill will to everyone in the house--everyone except for her niece, Beth. The missing woman's husband announces that the woman had rewritten her will, leaving everything to him, just before her disappearance. Meanwhile, everyone in the house is either afraid of the cat or just wants it gone, especially after it leaves deep scratches in the side of the butler's face. Beth disagrees, as the cat is always sweet around her, and she thinks that it's foolish for anyone to fear a cat. After a meeting where everyone but Beth agrees that the cat must be caught--and killed--people start dying. The cat is captured in a cage and the butler puts it in a bag, vowing to drown it in the river. The cat escapes and leads the butler out on a branch over a mire, where he loses his balance and sinks to his death. After muddy footprints in the kitchen cause the maid to chase after the cat, it jumps on her at the top of the stairs, causing her to fall and break her neck. How many more will become victims of the cat before they can kill it, or the reason for its attacks revealed?—antigrace It's late 1904 at a vast British country manor. The manor's wealthy owner, Ella Venable, has gone missing. Her favorite niece, Beth Venable, has been dispatched to the manor during this trying time, including to look after her uncle, Ella's husband Walter Venable, who has become largely bedridden in the emotional distress just having suffered a heart attack. Walter, Andrew the butler, and Clara the housekeeper seem further distressed by Ella's cat, Tabitha, who they believe is terrorizing them. As such, Walter also dispatches his brother, Edgar Venable, and Edgar's son and daughter-in-law, Jacob and Louise Venable, to the manor to help him and the two servants find and kill Tabitha. Beth cannot understand their fixation with Tabitha who is sweet on her whenever she sees her. In reality, Walter forced Ella to update her will leaving everything to him, nullifying her original will which left everything to Beth, after which Walter, Andrew and Clara killed Ella and buried her body deep in the woods on the manor's grounds, the two servants to share in the inheritance. The only witness to the murder was Tabitha. For their assistance, Walter, forced to tell them what he did, is also cutting Edgar, Jacob and Louise in on the inheritance. They are also tasked with finding and destroying the only copy of Ella's original will supposedly hidden somewhere in Ella's sanctuary of the attic. One wrinkle which may raise suspicions for Inspector Rowles who is leading the investigation into Ella's disappearance is that Jacob is an ex-con only recently released from prison. As the six become increasingly paranoid in their inability to kill Tabitha, with Tabitha only raising fear in them, Beth is not aware that her own life may be in danger from the six who will stop at nothing to ensure they get all of Ella's money. Michael Latimer, Beth's childhood friend and a newspaper man, as a proverbial outsider may be able to see things a little clearer in his suspicions that Walter, Andrew and Clara fear the cat in Tabitha knowing what they did to Ella, especially in Michael having no doubt about the validity of the rumors that Walter only married Ella for her money.—Huggo"

During WW2, 17-year-old Ira Hamilton Hayes, a Pima Indian from Arizona, enlists in the Marine Corps. During boot camp at Camp Pendleton in San Diego, Ira strikes up a strong and long-lasting friendship with fellow marine, Jim Sorenson. Shipped to the Pacific Theatre of Operations, the two marines fight on Mount Suribachi at Iwo Jima. They are among the six marines who raise the U.S. flag on Suribachi. Soon afterwards, Sorenson is killed by enemy fire in front of a stunned Ira. Later on, the surviving three marines who helped raise the flag at Iwo Jima are ordered back to the USA to participate in a war bond drive. They tour the country, surrounded by the mass-media and the adoring crowds. They participate at rallies, meetings, media-events and parades. They are asked to make public speeches to persuade the citizens to buy war bonds. However, heartbroken over his friend's death, Ira often turns to booze to give himself the courage to continue. His drinking worsens and he is sent back to his unit at the front lines. After the war his fame and notoriety makes it impossible to lead a normal life of anonymity. Many people, organizations, charities, causes and events ask for his participation, as a War Hero, for publicity purposes. But Ira, who still grieves his friend's death and doesn't consider himself a hero, is tired of all the publicity, the attention, the demanding fans and the numerous favors he's being asked for. He also feels guilty of having survived the war while his friends died. He drinks until he hits rock bottom. Vowing to stay sober, he returns to his tribe in Arizona where he lives with his family. He gives up booze and runs for election to the tribal council. Devastated by the loss in elections, Ira gets drunk one last time. He climbs the nearby mountain which, in his mind, is his personal Mount Suribachi at Iwo Jima. At the top, he finally takes his rightful place among his fallen comrades.—nufs68 A semi-fictional account of the exploits ofIra Hayes, a Native American of the Pima Nation of Arizona, during WWII and immediately following to his death in 1955 are presented. As he was underage at the time, his parents needed to sign the papers to allow him to enlist in the US Marine Corps, they doing so despite their fears of he being treated differently than other recruits because of his native heritage, and with many of those within the Pima Nation seeing the war as that of the white man who they feel disrespect them in not even providing the Pima with water while the new city of Phoenix is springing up with water galore for their residents' needs and wants. Indeed, he is both treated differently because of his heritage, and is ill-prepared for some of the most basic of tasks at boot camp, partly due to his youth and partly due to his lack of experience being Native American. Working hard to prove himself, he is ultimately able to earn the respect and friendship most specifically of fellow private, James Sorenson, arguably who was and is the most battle ready among those at camp. Being on the battlefield may be a different situation where no one will check one's background as mortar fire is blaring around them. A specific incident that happens when he, Sorenson and some of their fellow boot camp mates are in battle in Iwo Jima will forever affect his life, that incident to which he is inextricably tied and which he will never be able to fully deal with emotionally.—Huggo"

After a decade of bloodshed, the city is left in ruins only to be ""discovered"" again in 1893. The entire story focuses on Aeneas, played by Steve Reeves who is the star of the movie. Aeneas fights many battles during the movie. He even travels abroad and brings back an entire foreign army to defend his city. Aeneas leads the desperate final battle to defend Troy but all is lost. After the fall of the city, Aeneas leads the 600 survivors to Italy and founds the city of Rome. Many ancient Romans would take pride in their lineage to Aeneas. Steve Reeves also starred in the sequel, The Avenger (The last Glory of Troy). Larry Anderson.—Larry anderson"

CONTAINS SPOILERS Originally released in 1961 as Five Minutes to Live, this low-budget crime drama was later re-released as Door-to-Door Maniac. Fred narrates the film in flashback, detailing a suburban bank robbery that goes awry. In his simple plan, he hires a hard-up hood, Johnny Cabot to take the wife of the bank's vice president hostage. Cabot will hold her until he gets a call alerting him that Fred has been successful in getting ransom money. Cabot waits, and watches the Wilson house as the husband leaves for the bank and their young son heads off to school. Posing as a door-to-door guitar instructor, he forces his way into the house and takes Nancy Wilson hostage. At the bank, Fred talks his way into Ken Wilson's office, and presents his personal check for $70,000, intending that Wilson will withdraw the funds to cover the check as a ransom for his wife. He has Wilson call home to prove that Nancy is being held by the unstable Cabot, and gives Wilson 5 minutes to make his decision. If Fred fails to call the house back, Cabot is to kill Nancy. Wilson confesses to Fred that he has been planning to run off to Las Vegas with Ellen, the woman he has been having an affair with, and Fred will be doing him a favor by getting rid of Nancy. But as the minutes tick by, Wilson cracks and agrees to give him the money. Fred makes the first call to save Nancy. The clock starts ticking again, another 5 minutes, for Fred to collect the money and get out of the bank safely. While Fred is working on Wilson, Nancy is terrorized by Cabot-- manhandled and shot at, invited to slip into something more comfortable (which she does in a futile attempt to distract him) and finally forced to listen to him serenade her with ""Five Minutes to Live"" and ""I've Come to Kill"" while he waits for the second call. The call hasn't come as Fred has been overpowered by the police, who were alerted by the bank's silent alarm. Cabot is getting more and more stressed.

Cabot panics, grabs Bobby and runs into the yard under police fire. Bobby fakes his death to save himself, and Cabot is shot by a cop in the yard. Nancy is reunited with her now-contrite husband, who decides he will still go to Las Vegas, but with Nancy.

Antigone,1961,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0055375/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Antigone defies her uncle's decree that her traitorous brother should go unburied and therefore find no rest in the afterlife; however, her actions have tragic consequences. In the Ancient Greek city of Thebes, King Oedipus killed his father and married his mother Jocasta, having two sons - Eteocles and Polynieces - and two daughters - Ismene and Antigone. King Oedipus died a beggar in the exile after gouging out his own eyes, and Eteocles agreed to reign in Thebes in alternating years with Polynieces. However, Eteocles refuses to resign after the first year and Polynieces is exiled. Polynieces raises an army and attacks Thebes, and the two brothers kill each other. Crean, the new ruler of Thebes Creon decrees that Eteocles should have an honorable burial while the body of the traitor Polynieces should be left on the battlefield to be eaten by jackals and vultures. However, Antigone, who was betrothed to Creon's surviving son Haemon, defies Creon's orders and buries her brother. When Creon is reported of the attitude of Antigone, he sentences her to be sealed in a tomb alive. Antigone hangs herself in the tomb and Haemon tries to kill his father first and then he kills himself with his sword. When Creon's wife Eurydice is informed of the death of her son, she also commits suicide, leaving Creon alone.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil King Oedipus, the ruler of Thebes, blinds himself after learning that he inadvertently killed his own father, and got married to his mother. From this unholy union, Oedipus had four children: two sons, Eteocles and Polynices, and two daughters, Ismene and Antigone. After a tragic clash between brothers for the throne, the new monarch of Thebes, Creon, decrees that the body of the traitorous Polynices should be left unburied--a royal order which Antigone chooses to defy. Now, a cruel fate awaits the rebellious woman in the castle's cold and dank dungeons, as Apollo's blind prophet, Tiresias, warns the king of the Gods' wrath. Alas, an irreversible chain of events is already set in motion.—Nick Riganas After Oedipus is persecuted, he leaves the throne of Thebes to his two sons, Eteocles and Polyneices, who must take it in turns to rule. Eteocles rules first but the two become enemies after Eteocles refuses to give up the throne, and Polynices is exiled. He returns to attack in the Seven Against Thebes campaign. At the beginning of the play, both brothers are dead, apparently slain by the other's hand. The current ruler, Creon, has made a decree: Since Polynices fought against Thebes and betrayed his motherland, he shall be left unburied, without the proper burial rites. Meanwhile, Eteocles is to be buried with full military honors.Antigone, the youngest daughter of Oedipus and the sister of the dead brothers, believes this proclamation to be against the will of the gods (which she describes as ""...the unwritten and unfailing statutes of heaven. For their life is not of today or yesterday, but from all time, and no man knows when they were first put forth."") She confides her plan to bury Polynices herself to her sister Ismene, but Ismene, being more timid, refuses to take part. Ismene admits to her fear, but agrees with Antigone's motive.When Creon is informed that someone is trying to bury Polynices, he orders the body to be uncovered. Antigone is caught returning to her brother's body, and brought before the furious king. She proudly accepts her death as she sees no wrong in honouring her ""...unwept, unburied"" brother. Ismene claims that she also took part in the crime. But Antigone tells her to stay out of the matter, since she had chosen to have no part in the actions.Antigone's fiancé, Haemon (also Creon's son), arrives talking about how the whole city thinks Antigone did the right thing. Although he claims to be 'neutral' on the matter himself, he tells his father that he is on the side of the state. Creon, however, keeps yelling, saying that Haemon has sold out to a woman. Finally, Haemon states that Antigone's death will cause another. When Creon scoffs at the seeming threat on his own life, his son tells him it is not Creon who will die. Enraged, Creon decides to let Antigone starve to death in a sealed cave. The chorus persuades him to let Ismene go, as she is innocent.The blind prophet Tiresias then tells Creon that his actions are not right. Creon sneers, mocking Tiresias with how prophets have always loved gold. Tiresias tells him that soon his own flesh and blood will die, and his actions are causing a miasma (pollution). Faced with this terrible prophecy, Creon is torn but comes to the conclusion that Polynices must be buried and Antigone must not be killed.He finds that his anagnorisis (discovery) has come too late. Antigone has already committed suicide in the cave, hanging herself as her mother Jocasta had (in Oedipus the King). Haemon makes his way to save Antigone, but finds only her dead body in the cave. Creon also makes his way to Antigone but is confronted by the sight of Haemon leaning over Antigone's body. Haemon threatens Creon, before stabbing himself and taking his own life. Creon's wife, Eurydice, also kills herself in grief over the death of her son.Creon, having lost his family, lets himself be taken away. His hamartia (mistake) has come back with a vengeance, taking from him all that he loved."

Scientist Dr. Meeker, who has been doing tests on animals exposed to the primary nuclear fallout of Chemical X, is certain that iron has fused onto Eddie's internal body, literally making him a seemingly indestructible iron man.

Kipling's Women,1961,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0142453/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"One of the first of the Nudies to gain wide-spread showing in the U.S., although still relegated mostly to the grind houses or, in some situations, long-time schlock distributor Kroger Babb ""four-walled"" it, by renting the theatre for a flat fee and taking all of the proceeds including, according to one exhibitor, the theatre rental fees. This film purports to be ""A Picturization of Rudyard Kipling's Immortal Poem---The Ladies."" It starts with retired soldier and world-traveler Tommy Atkins in a pine lodge enjoying his pipe and 4-fingers of Scotch, and there to provide other creature comforts is the voluptuous Cameo Girl, while Tommy opens a Kipling volume that he allows is an account of his own experience with women around the world. The selling point in the ads is that all the women shown ""are wearing the wind"" and nothing else. Very true. Very naked. In addition to showing some nude shots in the press book, co-producer Harry Smith has inserted a plea to the projectionists to please don't snipe the film frames.

Bloodlust!,1961,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0054691/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A crazed hunter kidnaps people and turns them loose on his private estate, where he hunts them for sport. A group of teen-agers vacationing in the tropics take a boat out to a seemingly deserted island. They soon find, however, that the island is inhabited by a wealthy recluse and his staff. While their host is initially hospitable, he quickly reveals his true purpose: to hunt down and kill each of his visitors, as he has done with everyone unlucky enough to set foot on his island.—Jean-Marc Rocher <rocher@fiberbit.net> The movie opens with title and credits shown over an oil painting of a human skull and clawing hand. A fishing boat sits on a calm ocean. Two couples amuse themselves while on vacation. Johnny Randall (Robert Reed) and his girlfriend Betty Scott (June Kelley) are skeet shooting using empty liquor bottles for targets. Pete Garwood (Eugene Persson) and his girlfriend Jeanne Perry (Joan Lara) are fishing. The captain, Tony (Troy Patterson) is an unreliable drunk. Johnny is a good shot, but they are out of targets, so he decides to get amorous with Betty. Betty, the daughter of a Judo expert, demonstrates that she can handle herself in the clutch. Pete notices an island that was obscured earlier by clouds and mist. They decide to take the launch to the island and ask Tony to maneuver closer. Tony has passed out from drink, so Johnny maneuvers the boat closer to the island and the four take the launch to the beach. Tony wakes to see them leave and screams, ""Come back. Come back you fools. Don't land there. Come back."" The four land on the beach and go exploring. They do not see a man creep out from behind a rock and take their boat back out to sea. Johnny finds a large crab and they decide to have a clambake. The four head inland to gather banana leaves and Johnny falls into a large pit covered by brush. Betty eases her way into the pit to secure vines around her boyfriend so Pete and Jeanne can pull him out. They are interrupted by Dr. Albert Balleau (Wilton Graff) and two of his nautically dressed staff (uncredited). He directs his men to pull Johnny and Betty out of the pit.In a well-appointed trophy room, Balleau explains how he came to the island after the war. The walls of the room are covered with the heads of wild beasts. The two couples listen with interest, unaware they've entered a trap that will nearly cost them all their lives. Balleau explains he has developed a passion for hunting, ""As other men collect fame and riches, I collect trophies."" A very drunk Dean Gerrard (Walter Brooke) bursts into the room and says, ""I thought you had visitors. I hear these strange voices."" He dismisses himself and stumbles out of the room. Balleau apologizes for his house guest, explaining that he is a brilliant man when not drinking and an excellent chess player. When Johnny explains that they should be leaving, Balleau informs all four that it will not be possible to leave tonight. The jungle is far too dangerous to wander through at night. Johnny is concerned that when Tony finds them missing he might just return to the mainland and forget to return to find them. Pete proudly announces, ""Don't worry about that. Tony won't be going anywhere without us. I made sure of that before we left the boat by taking the rotor. He won't be able to start the engine without it."" A well-dressed woman wearing pearls and bracelets enters the room. Balleau joins her and grabs her arm. ""May I present my wife,"" he announces. Sandra Balleau (Lilyan Chauvin) is obviously terrified of her husband, but does manage to speak politely with the new guests. Sandra escorts Betty and Jeanne to a guest room. Jondor (Bobby Hall) enters the room and escorts Johnny and Pete to their room. Before they leave, Balleau tells them, ""Goodnight. Don't worry, everything will be taken care of."" Balleau pours himself a drink. Sometime later, in the same room, and at the same table, Sandra and Dean embrace and kiss. Sandra warns her lover that her husband could walk in any time and that there are spies all over the house. Dean tells Sandra they must try again, but Sandra warns, ""But how Dean, how? He can never allow anyone to leave this place alive. And he has made sure no one ever will."" Dean explains that the arrival of the four kids may provide a chance. Balleau walks in and snidely asks his wife, ""Sandra, entertaining our guest?"" He invites his wife and guest to join him on a stroll of the grounds, but they beg off and return to their rooms. Before they leave Balleau warns them that the presence of the four new guests does not change the situation for them.Betty and Jeanne sit on their beds in the guest room. There is a knock on the door. Johnny and Pete enter and discuss their curious circumstances. They decide to split up and explore the house. Pete and Jeanne head in one direction while Johnny and Betty take another. Johnny and Betty only get a few feet when they are intercepted by Dean and Sandra who cover the youngster's mouths. Dean tells them to return to their room. Once there, Dean tells Johnny and Betty, ""Something I want to tell you. Unless you do exactly as I say, you'll never get off this island."" Pete and Jeanne take a stairway down to a storage room. They spot rats scurrying among skeletal remains of a human. Jondor enters carrying a package, but does not see the couple hiding behind crates and barrels along the wall. Pete and Jeanne enter the preparation room. A large tank is bubbling in the center of the room. Jondor re-enters the prep room and opens the blinds on a tank. A woman's body is floating inside. Jondor pulls a human foot from a sink and places it on a table. He pulls the skin of a human head out of the sink and stuffs a towel into the cavity. Jondor throws the remains from the sink into the boiling tank, and then departs the prep room. Pete and Jeanne leave and return to the bedroom upstairs. By this time, Dean and Sandra have finished telling their story to Johnny and Betty. Johnny concludes they must leave tonight, but Dean explains that he and Sandra have been trying, unsuccessfully, for a year. Dean explains that he has a plan. He wants to meet with Johnny and Pete in the trophy room. He tells the boys that Balleau is out hunting and that Tony is probably one of the targets. His plan is to swim out to one of the boats moored offshore with Sandra and return with help. Dean and Sandra escape the house and exit through the main gate, but Balleau knows their plan and follows them.Two days later, Johnny and Betty meet in the trophy room. Jondor enters the room and exits through a section of the wall that opens. Johnny and Betty decide to explore the hidden room. Behind the wall is a large grotto--a cave that Balleau has turned into his human trophy room. Balleau is sitting in a large, wooden chair in the center of the room. He invites the young couple in and tells them, ""I have something I'd like to show you."" He flicks on a light in one of the niches and the stuffed body of a man (an uncredited Harry Wilson) is seen. He is looking up with his hands up in the air. Betty screams and Balleau explains, ""Welcome to my private trophy room. I had intended to show it to you in time, but why not now?"" Balleau lights a second niche and explains that the man on his knees with an arrow through his hands covering his head was a convict. He tells Johnny that during the war he was a sharpshooter. He enjoyed the work so much it became a passion, then a lust. A third niche contains the stuffed remains of Dean and Sandra. Before he leaves, Balleau lights another section of the cave and explains that it can hold three or four trophies.The four young guests gather around Balleau's desk. He has explained what is to follow. Johnny is horrified, but Pete thinks it is just a joke. The girls will remain in the house while Balleau will hunt Johnny, Pete, and one more man. Jondor drags Tony into the room and places him in a chair. Balleau tells the third man, ""Tony, you've outlived your usefulness to me. I paid you well to provide me with subjects in the past. I warned you not to use your boat for other purposes. But since you've been so foolish as to allow these young people to find their way here without my knowledge, I think it only right that you should share their fate."" Balleau demonstrates the lethal power of the crossbow by destroying a stone horse on the mantle. He reveals his plan for the girls, then tells Jondor to lock them in their room. He tells the three men he will supply them a chance and the starting point is the Tree of Death in the center of the island.The three men arrive at the Tree of Death and find one single bullet for the gun Tony is holding. Tony decides to take the bullet and go his own way. This leaves Johnny and Pete to head for the beach and try to work their way back to the house to rescue the girls. At the house, the girls try to figure a way out of their locked room. Betty has an idea. She stages breaking a vase to muffle the sound of breaking their bedroom window. Betty and Jeanne take the ledge to an open window in another room. In the jungle, Balleau and Jondor hunt the three men. Tony sits on a log to rest and hears Jondor fall and reveal their position in the jungle. Tony runs, doubles back, and gets the drop on Balleau. He takes careful aim, and fires the gun, but nothing happens. Balleau delights in explaining that the gun has no firing pin. After toying with the unreliable drunk, Balleau shoots and kills Tony. Pete and Johnny hear Tony's scream, but continue on towards the beach. The girls find their way to the prep room to find a weapon they can use. One of the staff enters the room. He disarms Betty of her knife and lunges for her. She employs her training in Judo to toss the man into the tank of boiling liquid. The skin on his face peels away as he screams. He falls back into the tank and dies. The boys stop to rest near the beach and hear Balleau and Jondor approaching. They encounter an insane man (Bill Coontz) in tattered clothes wandering around screaming. Pete manages to fall into a swamp of quicksand and is easily pulled free. Pete is covered quickly with leeches, which he and Johnny pull off.The girls make it to the front gate and escape the residence. Jondor steps into the quicksand to retrieve the jacket Johnny left. He sinks quickly and silently, as he is mute. Instead of helping his hunting partner, Balleau laughs and tells the sinking man, ""I'm grateful your own stupidity will save me the trouble of getting rid of you. It's sad the leeches will do their work so well. You might have made an interesting specimen for my museum."" The insane man confronts the girls. Their screams draw the boys to their location and assistance. The man's screams draw Balleau. Johnny manages to knock the insane man out with a tree branch. The four escape into the jungle. Balleau kills the insane man with a bolt from his crossbow. He retrieves the bolt from the body and returns to the house. The four have hidden up in a tree and decide to return to the house to find weapons. They make their way back to the trophy room and force open the gun cabinet. Unfortunately there is no ammunition in the gun case. Balleau returns to the house and finds the guard at the gate dead; his neck is broken. The four enter the human trophy room with two empty guns. Balleau notices the forced gun cabinet and enters the human trophy room. Balleau sits and taunts his four young guests until they reveal themselves. After Pete tells Balleau they had nothing to do with the guards death, Balleau panics. He asks Pete to light the final niche. Jondor, covered with leeches, approaches Balleau. Balleau empties three bullets into the mute, but he still has the strength to crush Balleau in a bear hug and impale him on his own tableau. He pushes Balleau's wrists through the spikes on the wooden display rack. The two wrists and the neck bleed profusely as Balleau dies on his own display. Johnny tells his girlfriend, ""Take it easy Betty. It's all over and we'll be safe now."" They stare at Balleau's body as Johnny further observes, ""I guess Balleau never thought he'd be the prize exhibit in his own museum."" We close with a final shot of Balleau hanging on the display rack and a man screaming."

Two pathologists -- a veteran department head (Fredric March) whose perspective has been shaped by years of red tape and day-to-day frustrations, and his new assistant (Ben Gazarra), a young, somewhat aggressive man who is more up-to-date but who lacks his colleague's personal touch -- clash in a small hospital's lab. The gulf between their approaches is dramatically illustrated by two critical cases that both are intimately involved in.—alfiehitchie Dr. David Coleman has just started working as the Assistant Pathologist at a county hospital in New York state, he working under the Chief Pathologist, Dr. Joseph Pearson. Both men know, spoken or not, that younger Dr. Coleman has been brought in as older Dr. Pearson's heir apparent, which does not sit well with the latter who will not be forced out, and who will run things his way without challenge as he has always done until he himself is good and ready to retire. In the process, he will not allow Dr. Coleman to make any fundamental changes to the department without his approval. While both doctors realize that things could be better with the department, Dr. Pearson sees most of the problems stemming from the tight financial constraints within he has always worked, and although Dr. Coleman agrees with that assessment to some extent, he also sees inherent problems in the way Dr. Pearson runs things regardless of the finances. Dr. Coleman also believes that certain up front outlays for equipment for example would make things more efficient leading to cost savings in the long run and more importantly better patient care. These issues place the two doctors at loggerheads with each other. While many issues arise, it may be two specific cases that show both doctors where they fit within the hospital especially in relation to each other. The first concerns the pregnant wife of intern Dr. Alexander, who has both personal and professional knowledge concerning what needs to be done for her in light of the death of their first child. And the second concerns the diagnosis for Cathy Hunt, a student nurse who Dr. Coleman has been dating, the tumor in her knee which is unclear if benign or malignant. In both cases, the work done in the Pathology Department is not only a matter of life or death, but that space in the middle of the possibility of a much reduced quality of life if unnecessary procedures are conducted the result of a misdiagnosis.—Huggo"

During the 1950s, in a small isolated Mexican village, the local Roman Catholic priest, Father Gomez (Leslie French), is an older man with a broken spirit. During his tenure in the village of Quantano, he fought hard to keep his flock of parishioners, in spite of threats and intimidation from the part of local bandit Anacleto Comachi (Sir Dirk Bogarde) and his men. The atheistic bandit has imposed his tyrannical rule over the region for many years. The local Police cannot find any witnesses to come forward and testify to any wrongdoing from the part of Anacleto. Therefore, they cannot charge him or arrest him. The Catholic Church replaces Father Gomez with a younger, more energetic priest, Father Keogh (Sir John Mills) from Ireland. Before departing the village, Father Gomez warns Father Keogh of the dangers of defying Anacleto Comachi's authority. But Father Keogh openly defies the bandit and administers his daily priestly duties at the village church. He even manages to persuade some of the villagers to start attending church again. In retaliation, Anacleto tries to intimidate the priest by starting to murder the villagers in alphabetical order. He also plans a few attempts on the priest's life. Coming between them, Locha (Mylène Demongeot), the beautiful daughter of the major local landowner, brings a bit of reason, sanity, and innocence to this violent world. Anacleto promises to Father Keogh to mend his ways and embrace religion if Father Keogh can persuade him that it's the religious message and teachings, not the personality and charisma of the priest that drives the faith.

She leaves feeling contented with herself.Keogh walks, carrying his small suitcase, to town. Children run after him and adults spit from behind drawn curtains. Father Gómez tells him that he has to be careful with his laundry, and tells the story of Malo - he is a bright young man who happens to hate the Church, because in his mind it represents all the corruption of politics. Father Gómez is stressed and anxious because he is afraid he's going to miss his coach out. Gomez says that he tried to become Malo's friend to bring him back to church, to no avail. Then, he complains that he - Father Gómez - should have died in defense of the Church, but he didn't, as Malo killed other people, innocent people just to terrorise all the townsfolk. Malo killed people in alphabetical order making everything look as accidents.At that moment Malo arrives. He's an attractive young man dressed in leather. He loves cats but is unkind. He says that the townspeople didn't welcome Keogh because nobody knew that he was coming.

Hegives stupid excuses not to go to church; also he is worried that his 6-month-old baby, Silvanito, is his wife Silvia's son, but not his. Jefe, the Police Captain (John Bentley) tells Keogh that Malo doesn't usually even have to use violence, as it came to the point when everybody is so terrified that nobody would dare oppose him. Jefe says that he needs proof, but nobody wants to become witness against him. Pedro de Cortínez (Roger Delgado) is a man who doesn't want to know anything about reality, he hides behind his books, and Lucha's mother is a disinterested woman, egotist and bored to death in this sleepy village, who would like to have been an international socialite. Pedro admits that he pays Anacleto for protection. Pedro also admits that Lucha behaves like a wild person. Lucha's mother, Doña Marian (Jacqueline Evans) offers Keogh a cup of hot chocolate. Lucha encounters Keogh later; she had already guessed that Keogh was looking for allies against Malo, but Pedro can't be bothered. Lucha says that god doesn't worry about Quantana at all. Keogh just wishes to see Lucha at church soon.A gang member (Larry Taylor) is setting some haystacks in fire in front of a rebellious farmer (Arthur Brough), who didn't pay for Anacleto's protection. Keogh appears and asks what's happening. Anacleto says that he and Marco (Frank Sieman) are trying to put off a fire. The farmer is so frightened that won't dare to contradict Anacleto.Keogh has visited a boy who was sickly. He notices Lucha staring at a car which won't start. Keogh solves the problem and starts the car. Lucha asks Keogh to teach her to drive - he is surprised that she is driving a car without really knowing how to, and he suggests that he become a sort of nurse in his dispensary.Keogh makes the bells sound. Many people go, but some of them are scared off by Malo's men. Lucha is defiant and looks at Malo's eyes before entering the church. Keogh starts preaching in the middle of the main square of the town. He tells everybody to kneel down and pray with him to fight the fear. Anacleto and his men appear, so that people stand up and leave while Keogh is left on his own still preaching on. Old Uncle finishes the prayer with an ""Amen"" on his own. Keogh says that he's prepared to suffer because of his faith. After Keogh has left, Anacleto asks what day he goes over the mountains to confess - it's on Wednesdays. Anacleto says that it's a pity that he has to be killed, because he likes him.Keogh gives first aid to the villagers with Lucha's help. Lucha realises that it's at that moment when Father Keogh is most vulnerable, and tells him so. Father Keogh tells him that nobody is ever on his own, smiles and leaves anyway, leaving her worried about him. Father Keogh is driven away. Lucha writes the names of Anacleto and Keogh in two pieces of paper, puts them in a small box, shakes it and picks one without looking - it says Anacleto. It looks like she doesn't like what she's chosen herself.Keogh arrives to a cross in the road. The driver puts water to the radiator of the car. The road is not very good, and the brakes of the car do not work. The car is moving faster and faster. Father Keogh sees a small mountain pathway and steers the car in that direction.Lucha goes to fix a glove. Anacleto lets her be tended to first. Lucha asked Anacleto not to harm Father Keogh. She tries to remind him that, a long time ago, he promised he would do anything for her; but Anacleto answers that she's right - that was a long time ago.Keogh tells Jefe, but he can't prove that Malo or any of his men cut the brakes' cable. The police officer offers police protection for him, but the priest refuses, as he can't be an example to the rest of the people if he's afraid himself. That night, he tolls the bells again, so that Anacleto realises that he's still alive. Lucha goes to visit Keogh at church. Lucha was hidden in the church, frightened. There's a noise outside, but there looks that nobody is there. Somebody with a machete attacks him, but the machete cuts on his bible. Keogh thinks that god has protected him, Old Uncle thinks it was the devil. Old Uncle offers to kill him. Anacleto says that they can't afford to fail one more time. He also knows that the bishop who sent Keogh to Quantana are watching for him - even in Rome they are aware of whatever happens to him. Pablo thinks that Anacleto admires Keogh too much, but Malo dismisses it, as it's only natural that one appreciates his enemies in their own value. He intends to use Michael Keogh's kind heart against him. Anacleto writes in a piece of paper a big ""D"".Chela (Selma Vaz Días) is Keogh's maid. She is serving dinner speaking about pythons when somebody knocks on the door. She complains that it's not civil hours - she gives Father Keogh what she found: the piece of paper with the letter D. The narrator says that D was for Domínguez, and we see the dead body of a man in the local river, E was for Elizondo, and we hear the scream of a man thrown down from a steep cliff, F was a young boy (Nyall Florenz), whom the audience sees still alive strolling around on his own. Keogh tells Jefe that he should arrest Anacleto, but the honest police officer cannot arrest Anacleto only on the ""alphabet"" clue - he needs a witness, or some evidence. Keogh believes that he's between the devil and the deep blue sea. A police officer (Jan Muzurus) arrives at that moment saying that a young boy was found run over, and that his name was Victorino Fernández. The child was only seven. Keogh gets really worked out on Anacleto, but then he restrains himself. Revenge is not the way, he says.Keogh leaves in anger and faces Anacleto, and wants to speak with him face-to-face. Anacleto asks him to be quick in a nonchalant way, because he's going to celebrate with his friends. Anacleto says that it had to be an accident. Keogh tells him to repent.Keogh visits Francisco Goya (John Steed), who works as Anacleto's messenger. He gives Father Keogh the letter in which somebody whose surname begins with ""G"", González, who will be killed in the early hours of the following morning. Jefe is positive that the following morning they may have at last proof against Anacleto. Jefe will hide in the farm of Anacleto, and threatens González in case he wants to tell Anacleto of the trap. Anacleto arrives with some of his men. Anacleto arrives with a paper and tells González to sign. The, he asks Keogh and Jefe whether they can breath hidden away. Anacleto says that he was only doing some business with González. However, Malo was about to leave. Jefe tells Keogh that it's not normal to do ""business"" at two in the morning.While they are coming back to Quamala, Francisco Goya, the messenger, was killed. Apparently, he was sleepwalking and fell from the window of his bedroom. Keogh officiates the funeral.Old Uncle thinks he's dying and calls for a priest. When Keogh arrives, he realises that Old Uncle's problem is that he's completely wasted. Old Uncle wants to confess. Pablo laughs and says ""Tell him about María, that's a good story"". Old Uncle still remembers when he was a boy and used to help the priest to celebrate mass. Anacleto arrives and inquires what's happening. He tells Keogh that he's sorry he's being played a joke. Keogh says that Old Uncle has some things on his conscience, but that there's no use hearing his confession in Old Uncle's present estate, and he leaves. When Father Keogh leaves, Anacleto tells off Pablo and Marco, calling him a fool. Anacleto throws some water to Old Uncle's face and asks him what he confessed to the Father, but the drunken old man says he can't remember, but then he says that Father Keogh wants to absolve Malo because Old Uncle loves Anacleto. Malo is furious that Old Uncle still wears a Catholic cross around his neck, but the old man says that he only wears it for good luck. Anacleto is angry because that cross proves that the Church and Keogh still have a little power over Old Uncle. Old Uncle throws it away through the window because he has never betrayed Malo, and he considers him as a son. Old Uncle drinks some more while Anacleto doesn't say anything else. Old Uncle leaves and almost falls down the stairs. Anacleto realises that the old man is going to look for the crucifix among the rubbish of the canteen.Anacleto pulls out his gun and goes to speak to Keogh. Chela sees him and runs to tell Jefe. Anacleto is not going to kill Father Keogh himself, though. All the opposite, he tells the priest that Old Uncle is coming to kill him. Malo asks Keogh what the priest told the old man; he says that he offered absolution to Anacleto if he confesses and repents, and that he wouldn't tell the police.Old Uncle arrives and Anacleto points his gun at the drunkard. He shows the necklace he found on the street. Old Uncle pushes Anacleto out of the way and goes for Father Keogh. They fight. Malo recovers and takes Old Uncle away from the priest, and finally shoots him on the back. Old Uncle cannot believe it. He tries to aim again and Malo shoots him twice. Old Uncle falls to the floor. Anacleto is hurt and Father Michael is OK. Jefe, the police officer and Chela arrive. Jefe now has the evidence that Anacleto tried to kill the priest, and nobody believes Keogh when he says that Anacleto was trying to protect him. Keogh insists that Anacleto is innocent, but nobody would believe him. Old Uncle came to kill the priest by Malo's orders. Jefe gives Anacleto 12 hours to leave town, or he'll go for him, thinking that Father Keogh wants to fight at both sides of the war. Anacleto says goodbye to Malo. He says that it must be irritating and fascinating at the same time to be a really good man. Chela is left with the body of Old Uncle and prays for him.The Presidente is celebrating the anniversary of Father Keogh's coming to Quantana. Anaclato comes back that very same night. He looks like a small-time squire. The priest asks him if he thinks it's wise to came back to the town. Anacleto says that he's thought about it, and that if the Catholic Church satisfies a man like him, it may also satisfy himself. Anacleto wants to believe and learn if it's the Church (the song) or the Singer (the people who believe) which make the message good. Anacleto wants to learn and be convinced. Father Keogh will try to convert him. Anacleto proposes to stay at the priest's house, as he doesn't have any friends anymore. Chela is outraged about the idea, and refuses because she had been eavesdropping. Chela wants Malo to sleep outdoors, but Keogh reprimands her and prepares a bed for him.Lucha doesn't want to hear how her mother tells her to enjoy life with boys, as the mother herself used to do when she was younger. She wants her to go to Florida and stay with Philip ""Phil"" Brown (Philip Gilbert), his rich cousin. In the ensuing argument, the mother finds some letter which she thinks they are love letters to Anacleto; she runs to show them to Father Keogh. The mother asks the priest to convince her to go to Florida. Keogh really thinks that Anacleto may convert.Anacleto reads the Bible. Father Keogh inquires about Lucha. Malo can't believe that she's in love with him. Malo thinks that if Lucha has a passion, it's not going to be for him, although the priest doesn't really understands what Malo means. The priest leaves, Anacleto looks out of the window and he sees Lucha arriving by car.Lucha enters the dispensary. Keogh is not there, but Anacleto is. Anacleto kisses Lucha, but she seems to reject him. Lucha says that she doesn't love him. Anacleto shows her one of her own letters and tells her that her parents and Keogh reached the obvious conclusion; he says that he is a modest man and that after the kiss he knows it's not him whom Lucha loves, and that realises that it must be hard for her to love a man who can't be hers. Anacleto says he understands her, which gives hopes to Lucha that Malo won't try to hurt him again.Father Keogh arrives. Anacleto leaves. They have no patients so far. The priest encourages Lucha to go to Florida. Lucha says that her mother wants her to marry Phil, but Lucha would prefer to become a spinster. Anyway, she'll go to Florida if Father Keogh thinks it's a good idea.Pablo asks Anacleto why he stays with the priest. Lucha has got engaged in the USA and will get married in Quantana in three weeks' time with Phil. Chela wishes Lucha happiness. Before, Lucha used to dress like a child, now she dresses as an old woman. Keogh is happy to see Lucha again, as nobody had told him that she was coming. Suddenly, Lucha doesn't look as happy. She says that Phil loves her and that she loves him as much as she could possibly love a man she could marry. That makes Father Keogh suspicious. Anacleto asks Keogh if he has ever loved a woman; he says that many years ago, before he got his vocation. Anacleto hasn't married because of his vocation as well.Lucha is running after her cat Lucky, which is in Anacleto's arms. He tries to convince her of not marrying Phil. Phil really loves Lucha. Phil has liked Father Keogh as well, who speaks wonders of Lucha. Michael Keogh marries Lucha and Phil. Lucha has a face of somebody who is going to be fed to the lions in her wedding dress. Anacleto arrives to see the wedding in his new fancy car. Keogh is terribly happy to marry her off, but suddenly he realises she's not happy at all. Lucha runs away without saying anything and leaves in Anacleto's car.Her father wants to police to rescue her, but Jefe tells him that she left to her own accord, she wasn't kidnapped and everybody has seen it. He also adds that it's Father Keogh's fault, because el Jefe himself would have never allowed Malo into the town again.Keogh is hearing a confesion (Eileen Way), and then Anacleto says he wants to confess. He tells Keogh that Lucha loves the priest, not him, which outrages Keogh, as he thinks he's lying. Anacleto says that the song is worthless. Anacleto thinks that Keogh will sacrifice the community of Quantana because he is in love with Lucha. A distraught Keogh prays in desperation.Lucha is being serenade, but she doesn't really appreciate it. Malo finally takes Father Keogh to Lucha. She hugs him and feels relieved he's OK. Lucha tells him that he's an egotistic man who never thinks on her. Finally, Lucha and Michael french-kiss. She is left even more distraught as Keogh doesn't love her.The bells in the tower toll. Anacleto goes to church with his friends. The rest of the townsfolk look at them with contempt. Father asks them to accept Anacleto if his repentance is honest, but he says that he'll denounce Anacleto's fake conversion. Finally, the priest denounces Malo. Anacleto runs from Jefe and his men. Malo is finally shot, although Louis keeps on helping him giving him a gun. During the shootout, Lucha takes cover while Father Keogh tells Jefe to take Malo alive. Finally, he shoots Anacleto twice and he dies.The priest runs to Anacleto, who's died. Pablo shoots Father Keogh, but he's shot by Jefe. Lucha cries and leaves. Father asks for an act of contrition from Anacleto, but he refuses. Keogh can't hear him, so he says that if he is repeating an act of contrition, he should press his hand.Anacleto says it's the singer, not the song, and presses his hand. Both die in each other's arms.---written by KrystelClaire"

Hand in Hand,1961,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0053889/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A little Roman Catholic boy and a little Jewish girl become best friends despite the prejudice that surrounds them. In the town of Springfield, England, adolescents Michael O'Malley and Rachel Mathias strike up a friendship despite their less than friendly first meeting at school. That friendship becomes so strong that they spend whatever time they can together, Mike even forgoing playing his regular games with his old friends just so that Rachel won't feel left out. Their friendship is primarily based on reaching for somewhat collective dreams, those that seem to be at the top of the list being going to London to have tea with the Queen, and going big game hunting in Africa. They feel they are stronger as a pair than they are as individuals. Their respective parents support the friendship, which they may not have if it was ten years later and the friendship was a romantic one, their parents who would like their respective offspring to marry within their own religion, Mike's family who is Catholic, Rachel's being Jewish. The first test to their friendship is the possibility of Rachel's family moving away to Marlow, thirty miles away. The second and arguably bigger test is when a classmate points out a fundamental difference between their two religions. By this time, Mike and Rachel have become what they consider blood brothers who cannot be separated. But they have to test whether their blood tie is stronger than their individual ties to their respective religion, the outcome of the test which may have unintended tragic consequences.—Huggo Michael O'Malley (Philip Needs), rushes to his priest to tearfully inform him that he has accidentally killed his closest friend, Rachel Mathias (Loretta Parry). The story is told in flashback as Michael recounts their friendship, when he first befriended Rachel after she was bullied at school. They quickly become the best of friends. The young children decide to become ""blood brothers"" by pricking their fingers and rubbing the blood together. They set off for an adventure, hoping to go to London to visit the queen, but instead are picked up by a kindly elderly lady (Sybil Thorndike) who takes them to her home for tea, pretending that she is a princess and that her mansion is one of the queen's homes, but that the queen is currently away. Her amiable deception goes over perfectly, and the children have a great time visiting with her.
Michael and Rachel are aware that they go to church on different days and their religions are somewhat different, but they do not ponder the specifics. However, when a somewhat overbearing and destructively-outspoken classmate informs Michael that Rachel is Jewish and that ""the Jews killed Christ"", an outraged Michael rushes to Rachel at their clubhouse and angrily confronts her, ""Why did you kill Christ?"" Rachel is shocked and insistently denies it: ""I didn't kill him. I don't even know him."" Michael and Rachel conclude that God is angry at them for becoming friends, but they are not sure if He will forgive them. They decide to attend church with each other to see if God is mad at them, believing they will die if He does not want them to go to each other's church. Michael sneaks into the synagogue with Rachel the next Saturday and is somewhat puzzled and intimidated by the ceremony, but he stays and seems to like it as time goes on, especially after a kindly rabbi shows him a passage in the Torah that speaks of God's love shielding him from all fear. The next day, Rachel goes with Michael to his church, and while Rachel is initially somewhat unnerved by the style of the services and the austere-looking statues, she too feels more comfortable after a while.
Having concluded it is acceptable to God that they remain friends, Michael and Rachel decide to take an inflatable raft on the Thames River for their next adventure, a trip to Africa. All goes well at first as Michael paddles and the raft drifts leisurely and makes smooth ripples on the calm water, but then when the raft enters a dangerous area of the river with a swifter flow and strong rapids, Michael loses control of the raft, and Rachel is knocked overboard. Due to the stronger current and the riverbank's dense underbrush in which Rachel has become entangled, Michael has great difficulty reaching Rachel, but at last pulls her out of the river; however, she is limp and unresponsive. Fearing the worst, Michael frantically rushes to get help, and adults in the area call for an ambulance. The film then returns to the present moment with Michael in his grief-stricken state, and telling the priest that he's killed Rachel. The priest comforts him and tells him that Rachel may be all right, and then accompanies him to Rachel's home to see how she is. They are met at the front door by Rachel's rabbi who is leaving, and he informs them that Rachel has pulled through and is recovering well, but that perhaps it would be better to wait till tomorrow to visit her. Michael, immensely relieved, rushes home happy that his little friend is alive, and the priest and the rabbi --- acknowledging that their respective religions hold more in common than they may have realized before --- speak warmly to each other before walking away in different directions."

February 10, 1960: MurderOn a dark night (February 10, 1960), Thomas Morely (Robert Colbert), gardener, dressed in pinstripes, reconnoiters the home of one of his clients, Paula Thornwall (June Blair). He enters the house and confronts her in her bedroom. He's ""looking for a little action"" and has some reason (how good a reason, we'll learn later) to believe that she might favor him with some. But of course she thinks he is beneath her, so she tells him to get out of there, or she'll call the police. Morely puts his lighted cigarette into her ashtray and otherwise does not move. So she picks up the phone. He takes the phone away from her and assaults her. She bites his hand, and he hits her hard enough to knock her out and lay her out on the floor. Now thoroughly angry, Morely picks up the nearest handy object, a pillow, and smothers her with it. Once she is dead, he puts the pillow back onto the bed, picks her up, lays her out on the bed, takes the cigarette from the ashtray, and places it in her hand. Then he leaves the house, just as the smoldering cigarette catches the sheet on fire. But on his way out, he is nearly blinded by the headlights of a car, and hides in a hedge, causing it some minor damage. (That will come out later in court.)In the next scene, Judge Leland ""Lee"" Hoffman (Efrem Zimbalist, Jr) and District Attorney Dan Callahan (James Kelly) are shooting ducks in a swamp. Matt Keenan (Carroll O'Connor), the local newspaper publisher, gives a shout to the other two and asks them who shot down a duck. The three gather inside a nearby cabin, which Hoffman owns. There Hoffman tells the other two that a political operative called him and told him that he could have the gubernatorial nomination in his party if he wanted it. Hoffman would like Callahan as a running mate, but Callahan demurs. Matt tries to persuade Callahan, without success (though Callahan won't say his preferences out loud). As the three are talking, a messenger arrives with a telegram to Callahan: get back to town to handle a murder case. Callahan send back another telegram, insisting that he will finish out his vacation, and unless Assistant DA Gorman was the murder target, he will not come back.The next morning (February 12), Police Sergeant Mickey Beers (Jesse White) drives up to Judge Hoffman's cabin and raps on the door. He is looking for Callahan. He tells Callahan that he has a perfect prime suspect: Walter Thornwall, ex-husband of Paula and nephew of ex-Govenor Oliver P. Thornwall. Callahan pays his respects to Hoffman and leaves without telling Hoffman the nature of his errand.Callahan returns to town and calls on Walter Thornwall (Rhodes Reason) at a project site that his contruction firm is working on. Callahan questions Thornwall about his marital status and his whereabouts on the night of his wife's death. What develops is that he has no alibi, for he has no one to vouch for him. Callahan then, in a blaze of publicity with cameras flashing, arrests Thornwall.Political Operative Charles Bosworth (Parley Baer) confers with Callahan and mentions a mutual friend and political operator: US Senator Alex S. Simon (Don Ameche).Simon is staying at the Dome Hotel, the most prestigious hotel in Capital City. Callahan goes to see Simon and boasts that the case of State v. Thornwall will be his ticket to the nomination. The reason: by prosecuting without hesitation a man connected with the Party, Callahan comes off as not ""putting in the fix."" Senator Simon expresses doubts. Callahan cites a rumor that Walter Thornwall once attacked his wife with a carving knife. To be more specific, Paula Thornwall called police, accusing Walter of the threat, but recanted when police arrived. Simon insists that such hearsay would never stand up. (Paula obviously cannot substantiate it, because she's dead.) Simon then drops a bombshell: he wants to run for governor himself. Callahan can't understand why any US Senator would ""step down"" to become Governor. Simon, unmoved, insists that he will run. He offers Callahan the bone of filling out his (Simon's) unexpired Senate term. Callahan refuses. The battle lines drawn, the two men part bitter enemies.As Callahan and Bosworth walk out of The Dome, they run into none other than Judge Hoffman. Callahan now reveals to Hoffman that he's running for Governor. Hoffman takes it with slightly more equanimity than Simon did, but reminds Callahan that he, Judge Hoffman, will try the case of State v. Thornwall.Hoffman checks in at The Dome (where he has a permanent suite of rooms) for messages. In the meantime, Cathy Simon (Angie Dickinson), Alex' wife, enters the hotel and chats with the keeper of the gift shop. She and Hoffman know one another from before her marriage to Alex and are close friends. That's all they are to one another, but Cathy's demeanor suggests that she is sorry she married Alex Simon and not Lee Hoffman. In fact, Hoffman married another woman, but she fell ill and finally died. That happened two years before and Cathy has never really gotten Lee Hoffman out of her heart.That night, Hoffman talks to Simon about his governorship run. Simon dishes out the ""good for the Party"" line. Hoffman isn't buying. Hoffman reveals that his late wife steered him into politics. Simon wants Hoffman for his running mate, but Hoffman refuses to enter the race for any office until the trial concludes.March 10, 1960: TrialAs the trial begins, the older neighbor, Emma Jensen (Louise Lorimer), who saw the assailant, misidentifies Thornwall as the man. Thornwall blurts out that she's lying, and Hoffman chides Defense Attorney Clem Marker (Ray Danton) on controlling his client in court. Mrs. Jensen tells the court that she drove to the corner drugstore before she saw the smoke from the fire that nearly destroyed the bedroom before the firemen arrived. On cross-examination, Marker establishes that Mrs. Jensen has grounds to resent Walter Thornwall over a neighborly dispute over land on their adjoining estates. Specifically, Walter Thornwall refused to grant an easement to a developer for the building of a subdivision.The next witness is the medical examiner (Maurice Wells). (Note: the title of ""coroner"" is misleading. A ""coroner"" is an elected law-enforcement official having the power to inquire officially into a person's death. A medical examiner merely performs an autopsy and offers medical evidence only.) He testifies to finding a bruise on Paula Thornwall's left temple, and the absence of any indicators of asphyxia. ""In all probability she was dead before the fire started,"" he concludes. Callahan then asks the medical examiner how many sexual partners Paula Thornwall had in the twenty-four hours preceding her death. Now we know the motive that the prosecution is alleging: that Paula Thornwall was a sex maniac, and Walter Thornwall killed her in a jealous rage. (We also know, now, why Tom Morely thought he could ""score a little action"" from Mrs. Thornwall, not realizing that she could be pretty stuck-up about class distinctions.) Judge Hoffman finds that evidence distasteful, but in the absence of any objection to it by the defense, he cannot exclude it.At Simon's campaign HQ, Simon receives the newspapers playing up the adultery angle. Now he knows the kind of candidate (i.e., Callahan) he's up against.Next day, Callahan calls several male witnesses, all former lovers of the late Paula Thornwall. As he wraps up for the day, he takes more campaign advice from Bosworth. Judge Hoffman retires to his chambers, where Alex Simon is waiting. Simon insinuates that Callahan is risking making Thornwall sympathetic to the jury. (And an all-male jury in that day, in some jurisdictions, might have reduced the charge on a man who killed his wife in a jealous rage, if she were the type who ""slept around."") Simon then reminds Hoffman of an elderly federal judge who died recently by accident. Simon is offering Hoffman an appointment to replace the late judge, in return for any help he could give the defense so that Callahan would lose the case. Specifically, he wants Hoffman to call a mistrial of the case on any pretext that comes his way. (Simon anticipates, but does not tell Hoffman, that Callahan will try to introduce the questionable prior domestic disturbance in the Thornwall home.) Hoffman, now furious, throws Simon out of his chambers for attempted bribery. Simon, unflapped and unrepentant, reminds Hoffman that he could become a Justice of the US Supreme Court if he ""plays ball.""That night, in a driving rain, Cathy Simon comes to see Hoffman. Cathy pleads with Hoffman not to hold Simon's bribery attempt against him. Hoffman cannot let it go, but Cathy pleads with Hoffman not to accuse him. Then she reminds Hoffman that Simon's heart is not up to par. But that's not why Simon wants to be Governor. Simon wants to control the delegation to the party national convention. He wants to run for President of the United States, in the belief that only in that way can he hold Cathy's love. Aiex, simply put, is jealous of Lee Hoffman's earlier association with Cathy, though Hoffman has never pressed the point. Hoffman, against his better judgment, agrees to let the matter drop.The trial resumes, and Tom Morely takes the stand. He is so nervous that Judge Hoffman has to calm him down. (Of course he's nervous; he's testifying at a trial in a death he himself caused!) Morely reveals that he had worked for the Thornwalls for six months. He testifies to damage to the hedge that he ""found"" (har-de-har-har) on the day after the murder. The defense stipulates to the damage to the hedge, but no one knows why Hoffman has to remind Morely twice that he can stand down.That evening, Callahan listens to an angry ultimatum from a campaign contributor who wants a favor. Callahan squeezes the contributor for as much as he can before he guarantees him an appointment that he wants.The next day, at trial, old Governor Thornwall (Herbert Marshall) himself testifies from his wheelchair. He testifies for the defense that he last saw the Thornwalls at his home. He tried to reconcile the two, but failed. They did not discuss divorce, nor did Walter criticize Paula at all. Callahan declines to cross-examine.Then Callahan asks to reopen his case. He calls Laura Mayberry (Andra Martin), who takes the stand after the bailiff calls her name twice. Walter denies to his lawyer that Ms. Mayberry can give any relevant evidence. She testifies that, after attending every session of the trial and appearing on time, she came in late this morning. Callahan draws out that she went to a beauty parlor, and then withdraws his question and gets to the point: she is Thornwall's private secretary, and often worked late with him and ate out at out-of-town restaurants. Callahan then presses her to say that she is not only in love with Walter Thornwall, but carrying his child. She refuses to admit to either, and the defense calmly declines cross-examination.Next, Callahan calls Mickey Beers. Beers testifies that he investigated the relationship between Laura Mayberry and Walter Thornwall. Beers says that he found no evidence that the two had any relationship other than professional. But he also testifies to her getting a hairdo that morning. Beers then reveals that the beauty parlor owner was a contact for an abortionist. In front of everyone, Walter Thornwall desperately tells Laura not repeat not to have an abortion, no matter what happens to him. (This film uses the euphemism ""illegal operation"" to refer to abortion, doubtless one of the last of the concessions to the old Hays Code.)Marker stands up to cross-examine Beers. He lays into Beers with both barrels, revealing that Beers took pains to summon Callahan (by telegram) the day after the murder. Marker draws out who told Beers to send the telegram: Charles Bosworth, Callahan's campaign manager. Marker forces Beers to reveal that he and Callahan have been friends as boys. Callahan repeatedly objects, and Hoffman cautions Marker not to press Beers further on Callahan's motives for prosecuting the case.Marker then turns to the statistics on smoking in bed. The point: this is the first time in recent memory that the police have suspected murder in a smoke-in-bed death. Beers pleads a hunch, but he can't explain why he thought that murder had been done. Marker lays into Beers with a proverbial rubber hose, and then Beers blurts out the history of Thornwall trying to kill his wife before.Triumphantly, Marker moves a mistrial. Hoffman strenuously gavels the courtroom to order and has the jury taken out. In the absence of the jury, Hoffman hears arguments on the mistrial motion. Marker's argument is simple: bringing prior history before the jury is needlessly prejudicial, and hearsay. Marker even accuses Callahan of coaching Beers to introduce the evidence; that causes Hoffman to threaten both men with sanction.Callahan stands by the allegation and gives the full history of the complaint, which Paula Thornwall recanted later. Callahan also says that Marker made the mistake of asking Beers specifically what made him suspect murder in a smoke-in-bed death.Hoffman, possibly looking for a reason not to declare a mistrial (and thus benefit Simon), says that he will deny the mistrial, but instruct the jury to disregard the question and the answer.That evening he checks in at The Dome, having sent the case to the jury. Alex Simon has left him a message. Then Cathy Simon greets Hoffman and gets him to admit that he overruled a perfectly sound mistrial motion just to send a message to Alex Simon that he, Hoffman, could not be bought. The two of them lamely discuss the prospect that Walter Thornwall, if convicted, could appeal his case, and the appellate court can remand the case for a new trial if Hoffman has committed reversible error.The note from Alex is brutal: Alex has submitted another man's name for consideration for the vacant federal judgeship.Hoffman then goes to see Callahan and asks him what he would do if Thornwall is acquitted. Callahan is confident that he will not lose. Hoffman reminds Callahan that the State Supreme Court might still remand the case for a new trial on account of the mistrial question. Hoffman offers to support Callahan if the verdict is guilty--but if it is not guilty, Dan should support him. The reason: Hoffman wants to stop Alex Simon at all costs. Callahan demands that Hoffman support him no matter what verdict the jury brings in.Callahan gets a telephone message from Bosworth to tune in the TV. On the channel, Oliver Thornwall is publicly telling Callahan not to run, and that he would not vote for either ""active candidate."" In fact, Oliver Thornwall wants Judge Hoffman to stand for the nomination. Hoffman renews his offer, and Callahan shakes on it.The next day, the verdict comes in: ""Guilty."" Laura Mayberry, of course, is crushed, even more than is Walter Thornwall. Hoffman, now that the crunch has come, is not sure that he wants to go through with his deal with Callahan.July 4, 1960: The PicnicAt the Independence Day picnic, Alex Simon is pressing the flesh. Cathy comes to see Hoffman to tell him that the appellate court refused to remand the case. Hoffman knows that he did wrong, and decides that he must get Thornwall a new trial no matter what it costs him, or anyone else. Hoffman goes to Callahan and tells him about the bribery attempt by Simon. Callahan, desperately afraid, doesn't want Hoffman to speak up. Hoffman thinks only of Thornwall, but Callahan thinks only of himself. Callahan offers to make the announcement himself, but Hoffman says that Hoffman, and only Hoffman, can break a thing like that.Callahan goes to Mickey and asks him to drive him to the TV station in town. The two get into a police car and start to drive. Tragedy strikes: the two men strike a boy on a side street. (The boy will survive, but those two men can't predict that then.) So the two men collaborate on a false story to give to the papers: that they were on official business, trying to arrest a drug pusher after Mickey had gotten a tip over the telephone in the park.Callahan does get to the TV station, to announce that he repudiates Judge Hoffman's suggestion that Alex Simon tried to bribe anyone. He then says that if Hoffman presses the matter further, Callahan will push to have him disbarred.Alex Simon, in his rooms in The Dome, gives his own statement that Callahan and Hoffman are playing with fire, all in the name of politics. He suggests that Hoffman didn't do anything about the bribery attempt then because he had no evidence. Cathy, listening to him talk, can't take it anymore, and retires to their bedroom. Alex then dismisses his campaign advisers, saying that he doesn't feel well. But when he goes into the bedroom to talk to Cathy, the two argue about Hoffman. Cathy accuses Alex of destroying Hoffman for ignoble reasons, and then says that Alex seems to have no self-respect. Alex then returns to his old theme: he is jealous of Hoffman. Finally Alex blurts out that he wants to make her the first lady in the land. And then, so saying, he has a heart attack.Cathy summons medical aid, and has Alex taken to a hospital. Alex summons Hoffman, who comes to Alex' side. Alex lives long enough to confess to his campaign adviser, in front of Hoffman, that Hoffman was correct ""from his point of view"" in his accusation about the bribery attempt. Simon throws all his support to Callahan, who ""knows all the rules of the game."" His last words are to his wife, to ask her to remember him properly. So saying, he dies.Cathy flies back to Washington, DC for the funeral, and to arrange with a real-estate agency to sell the Simons' house (presumably in Northern Virginia). Hoffman decides to run for the Party nomination for governor against Callahan. He didn't like Simon, and now he likes Callahan even less.Hoffman goes to see a man named Earl Miller (Leonard Bremen), a private eye who taps telephones. He hires Miller to tap the telephone of Mickey Beers. Then Hoffman goes to see Beers, and to lay on him some information that he knows will frighten him: that he knows that the story that he and Callahan gave to the press, after the accident to the boy in the side street, was false. And how does he know? Because the park telephone, that they were supposed to have used, was out of order. Beers could get two years in prison for misprising official business. After Hoffman leaves, Beers calls Callahan. Outside, in a disguised van, Miller records everything.Two days later, Hoffman calls an unusual hearing with Callahan and Marker. Callahan objects, pleading politics, and Hoffman threatens him with contempt of court if he doesn't shut up. Hoffman calls Miller to the stand, and gets Miller to lay a foundation for the tape recording. Hoffman admits for the record that he hired Miller. Callahan and his assistant try to leave, but Hoffman orders the bailiffs to stop them, and the two to return to their seats. Then Hoffman orders the first part of the recording played. Marker wants to know whether the proceedings will serve his client's interests, and Hoffman assures him that they will.Hoffman plays enough of the tape to show that Sergeant Beers had called Callahan. But then Hoffman has a change of heart. He stops the tape, excuses Miller, and admits that he might have acted beyond his authority. He orders all remarks to and from the bench stricken. Then he orders everyone out of the courtroom except Callahan.Now, one-on-one with Callahan, Hoffman plays the rest of the tape. Clearly Hoffman has enough to ruin Callahan, including the key fact that Beers introduced the prejudicial evidence against Thornwall to do Callahan a favor. Hoffman gives Callahan an ultimatum: get Thornwall a new trial, and Hoffman will send him the tape.Callahan goes outside and tells the press that Thornwall should get a new trial, because he and the Judge were both candidates for governor.The State Supreme Court grants the remand. Tom Morely, his conscience never clear, hears that on his truck radio. He flees to his apartment, and suffers an acute upset stomach when two detectives come for him. All they want is to inform him that he will have to testify again, but of course he thinks they're there to arrest him. When the detectives leave, he flees the city--and the highway patrol chases after him for speeding. The patrolmen summon an interceptor. Morely leaves the road, but must stop for a moving train. He tries to hop the train, but the HP fire their guns in the air to stop him.Callahan gets Morely to confess, and so the headlines read: CALLAHAN CLEARS THORNWALL. But publisher Matt Keenan goes to Judge Hoffman to urge him to run for governor anyway. Hoffman, frustrated, packs a bag to go fishing; Matt can't stop him. But Matt does take a call from his editors: the bar association censured Hoffman for failing to report the bribery attempt, and suggested that he resign from the bench.The State nominating convention is in deadlock. Callahan is one of four candidates, none of whom can get a majority, even after twenty-nine ballots. In the middle of this, Cathy Simon goes to Hoffman's cabin and pleads with him to come to the convention. Hoffman is afraid to show his face, but Cathy insists that he come anyway.When Hoffman shows up, the delegates, as soon as they recognize him, stand up and cheer. Governor Thornwall, on the stage, introduces Hoffman and nominates him. Then county after county abruptly give all their votes to Judge Hoffman. Finally, another delegate asks to suspend the rules and nominate Hoffman by acclamation."

In order to terrify them even further, he warns each one when he is coming for them. The Professor, dedicated to the belief that supernatural beings such as vampires and werewolves do not exist, has been re-elected chairman of a local committee dedicated to proving this to the masses. But that night he finds a visitor inexplicably in his study, who claims to be the 400 year old son of Nostradamus the Alchemist and demands that he be acknowledged publicly as such so that he may rebuild his father's cult. When the Professor refuses, Nostradamus, as he also calls himself, proceeds to predict the death next day of an admirer of the Professor's work; and the man indeed dies - buried alive while in a death-like paralysis, as the Professor later discovers. Meanwhile, Nostradamus withstands six point-blank bullets fired by the Professor, then becomes a bat and flies away.

No Love for Johnnie,1961,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0055234/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"After winning re-election, British Labour Party M.P. Johnnie Byrne faces a series of setbacks in his political career, as well as in his marriage, and must act wisely in order to save both. Johnnie Byrne is a member of the British Parliament. In his 40s, he's feeling frustrated with his life and his personal as well as professional problems tower up over him. His desires to win the next election are endangered by his constant looking for love and he is faced with the choice of giving up a career in politics or giving up the woman he loves.—Lars Skogan Representing the Labour Party, popular forty-two year old politician Johnnie Burke has been reelected with a larger majority as a Member of the British Parliament, this time on the governing side. Many speculate that Prime Minister Stephens will offer him a high ranking position in government, but that is not the case. As an ambitious politician, he is privately disappointed, but initially shows public support for his leader's decisions. At home, he is in a long time loveless marriage to Alice, who leaves him, he thinks because he didn't get a post within government. Her departure highlights how much he really craves female companionship, both physically and emotionally. The first woman available to him in both capacities is his lonely but willing neighbor, Mary. But Johnnie eventually meets twenty year old model Pauline West, to who he is immediately attracted. But a married man carrying on with a woman young enough to be his daughter is not compatible with the life of a politician, especially one who is contemplating making an opportunistic move in government. Johnnie has to decide if his personal or political life is more important, especially as women enter and exit his life.—Huggo The film, black and white starts off up north in Earnley and a quick summary of presumably a long General Election shown, returning Johnnie Byrne(Finch) to Parliament. Even before he leaves he is sneering of those who voted for him and disappointed in his anticipation of some sort of job in Government. Goes home to his Communist Party supporting wife and generally feels sorry for himself. Then he prowls around looking for ""love"" or some sort of extra marital relationship and in between, plans with other MPs to challenge his own leader, the Prime Minister.Meets Mary (Billie Whitelaw) a nice neighbour but mishandles the situation and goes onto a girl at a party Pauline West(Mary Peach) who is way too young for him. His plans to scupper the Government gets lost in a lovers tryst with Peach but they drift apart almost immediately.Johnnie Byrne is ""found out"" by his party and his own constituents and gets a severe warning. But is in luck as there is a terminally ill Minister and Johnnie Byrne gets a job as a result. One proviso from Prime Minister (Geoffrey Keen) - no wife with such views needed. So the good chance of a reconciliation with wife (Rosalie Crutchley) is missed and she is ""dumped"" without a moments hesitation and Johnnie gets his love ""for power"".The self satisfied putting up of his feet on the bench in front of him by Peter Finch at the end was rightly thought chilling back in the day. In the Ralph Thomas' directed film, for the fictional Members of Parliament it seemed the only way to sit comfortably in those front benches. But more recently in real life, at least metaphorically, would I be correct in suggesting it seems required?Peter Barkworth, Stanley Holloway, the Cutty Sark area and Peter Sallis give telling cameos and Donald Pleasance is - well, Donald Pleasance. He is not stroking a pussy cat and sitting in a volcano but he may as well have been.Film was released 1960/1. The by then, late Wilfred Fienburgh's take (as a MP himself (1951-58) at the time the book of the same name was written - published 1958) is so cynical and so the year 2000 +"

Za dvoma zaytsiamy,1961,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0055635/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Madcap comedy set in early 20th century Kyiv about a barber whose fondness for drink, gambling, and women lead to bankruptcy. He marries an ugly rich woman to solve his financial woes, but pines for a virtuous beauty who despises him. In the early 20th-century Kyiv, a young rascal named Svyryd Holokhvostyi (Not-A-Penny) owns a barbershop, which is on the verge of bankruptcy. Holokhvostyi spends most of his time drinking, gambling, and chasing women. After his shop is seized by the police for unpaid debts, Holokhvostyi decides to marry a rich but pathetically ugly Pronia and thus to solve his pecuniary woes.Pronia, ashamed of her unfashionable Ukrainian origins and her simple Ukrainian parents, is easily beguiled by her suitor's ""aristocratic manners"". She eagerly accepts his marriage proposal. In a parallel line of action, Holokhvostyi proposes to the beautiful but poor Halia who rejects him. By pretending to be rich, he persuades Sekleta Lymerykha, Halia's mother, to marry Halia off to him. His pursuit of wealth and love quickly proves to be a recipe for his own undoing.It creates a lot of hilarious situations for today's viewer who immediately recognizes in this movie some of the perennial themes of the Ukrainian condition: the laughable imperial arrogance and artificiality of high Russian culture imposed upon common Ukrainian folk, the futility of chasing it, of pretending to be what you are not. It is thanks to this continuing resonance with specifically Ukrainian sensibilities that the story enjoys an undiminished popularity even today.The movie is based on the stage-play by Mykhailo Starytskyi ""Za dvoma zaytsiamy"" (Chasing Two Hares), 1883. The play was a theater adaptation of the story ""Na kozhum'yakakh"" (In the District of Kozhum'yaky) by another Ukrainian classic Ivan Nechuy-Levytsky."

Two Loves,1961,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0055557/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"American Anna Vorontosov teaches in a rural school on New Zealand's North Island. Her class of younger students is comprised largely of Maoris. She feels that western methods are not the most appropriate in teaching her students, for who concepts such as ""see Jane run"" have no cultural context. She wants her students to ""feel"", from love to pain to joy, and as such her classes are outwardly disorganized and chaotic. Her livelihood is potentially threatened with the arrival of a new senior inspector of primary schools, a Brit name William Abercrombie. To make her classes seem more organized to Abercrombie, Anna enlists the help of one of the older students, fifteen year old Maori, Whareparita. Anna's students, including Whareparita, see her as their guardian angel. Anna's burgeoning friendship with Whareparita may show her that although she has her students' best interests at heart, she may also not fully understand the culture within which she now lives. Teaching is her life, which leaves no time for men, sex about which she has repressive views. These views affect her relationship with two very different men who fall in love with her. The first is fellow teacher, Paul Lathrope, a brash Brit. He is a lost soul with self-destructive tendencies. The second is married Abercrombie himself, whose marriage is albeit unsatisfying and long-distance.—Huggo American Anna Vorontosov (Shirley MacLaine) teaches the younger children, mostly Maori, at a rural school on New Zealand's North Island. She has made teaching the focus of her life. Her classroom is disorganized and chaotic, which she believes gives these children the freedom to learn. She arrives at her class one morning to learn from her students that a new superintendent of schools stopped by earlier. Worried, Anna talks to the school's headmaster, Mr. Reardon (Ronald Long), about how she can best present her class as she wants to the new superintendent without he firing her. They decide that getting one of the older girls in the school to help her for a few weeks is the appropriate solution. That girl will come from the class of fellow teacher, motorcycle riding Paul Lathrope (Laurence Harvey), a brash Brit who has been at the school now for six months. As Paul and Anna scope out the girls for the assistant position, he asks her why she has not yet made any attempt to get to know him better outside the school confines, implying that he is attracted to her. She innocently brushes off his advances, as she is inexperienced and prudish about sex, especially out of wedlock. As her assistant, they choose 15 year old Whareparita (Nobu McCarthy), a Maori girl who is honored as she idolizes Miss Vorontosov. As Anna and Whareparita go back to her classroom, Anna is amazed to see her students quietly sitting at their desks. They tell her it's because the new superintendent, William W.J. Abercrombie (Jack Hawkins), who told them to do so, is in the back room of her class. Meeting him, Anna, without being asked, immediately goes into a diatribe of why she does the things the way she does in her classroom, all in not having any rules that come between her and her students. Abercrombie seems confused, he only interested in a book she has, it a work composed by the children but compiled by her. He would like to borrow it. She believes its contents will shock him as unorthodox.During recess, Mark Cutter (Neil Woodward), one of Anna's few Caucasian students, enters the classroom while she is relaxing at her desk. He initially refuses to remove his shoes as she asks, since his mother told him that only uncouth Maoris do so. Anna is able to convince him to do so regardless. He then tells her that his best friend, a Maori boy named Matawhero (Edmund Vargas) ran away and will not be returning to school, Matawhero who often helps her in class. Incensed that Matawhero has dropped out of school, she rushes off to the Maori compound where Matawhero lives, and which is led by his grandfather, the largely westernized Chief Rauhuia (Juano Hernandez). The Chief believes Miss Vorontosov a saint since she has taught Matawhero to read and write. She learns directly from Matawhero, who was hiding in the room listening to the conversation, that he ran off because someone at school hit him with a big stick. He refuses to tell who, she only hoping that it was not one of the Caucasian children, which would cause problems. She is able to persuade Matawhero to return to school with her. As they arrive back at the school, she can tell by Matawhero's reaction that the person who hit him was Mr. Lathrope. She begins to berate Paul for using fear as a method of discipline, especially on a little boy. Paul admits to her of his insecurities: that he doesn't do his job well, this being his first ever teaching job, and that he plans on quitting at the end of term. He further tells her of his dream to be a singer. This discussion softens her perspective of him. They agree to a date this evening at her place, where he will sing for her, as he knows she has a piano as he has often heard her play as he passes by her house in the morning.Later at her house, Paul sings a German song for Anna while she accompanies him on the piano. His rendition of the song is ballsy and obvious. He believes it was great, he always singing with whatever emotion he is feeling. She tries to provide him with some constructive criticism, which he does not take well. He admits that anything he touches figuratively turns out badly. She tries to show compassion, which he wants to believe is romantic interest. When he approaches her romantically, even stating that he would like to stay the night, her prudish self retreats. As he storms off, he tells her that she is already in a relationship: with her students.During the middle of one of Anna's classes, Abercrombie arrives, wanting to speak to her about the book he borrowed. He reads one of the stories included, in which a student talks about a jailed father, a knife fight and the family having no money. He is amazed that children that young even know the word knife when seen as spelled. Anna passionately tells him that the children will learn only if they feel, and not reading about ""Tom having fun"" as is the case with most western readers, such stories which have no cultural context for her children.Anna continues to have encounters with Paul outside of the school, most either by chance or on Paul's initiative. They include a chance encounter one rainy evening in town while Paul is drunk and which she helps him home. Another is when he appears outside her house in the middle of the night, again drunk. Another is on a staff outing to Mount Taranaki, he who is waiting for her at her house following the mountain hike. These encounters generally demonstrate Paul's childlike behavior in his pursuit of her, and his loneliness and his seemingly friendlessness. Regardless, she can't help but be drawn to him if only in an effort to help him, but not before their encounters usually ending with the two at odds because of her pushing away his sexual advances.Anna, after a shopping trip to buy school supplies the district will not provide for her, goes to speak to Abercrombie about Paul, she wanting to help him and not get him into trouble. Abercrombie knows all about Paul, and about his troubled past, which includes a difficult stint in the military, and an attempted suicide. Abercrombie fought to keep him on staff despite calls to dismiss him, as he sees in Paul a man with passion underneath his problems. This meeting also begins a process of Anna getting to know about Abercrombie: that he is from England; that his wife and sons were in New Zealand but have returned to London; that their marriage is an unsatisfying one for him as his wife continually pushes him away; and that he too is a lonely man in New Zealand. He slowly begins his own pursuit of Anna.During a class, Anna and Whareparita are checking for lice in the students' hair, and burning the lice whenever they find any. One of the younger girls starts crying at the thought of being burned. Whareparita is able to comfort her. Watching the interaction, Anna feels that Whareparita is blossoming into a woman in front of her eyes. Anna begins to talk to her about the change into womanhood, Whareparita responding that they have already learned about such things in social hygiene class. Later, on a school outing, Whareparita faints. It is because she is pregnant, about which she is forthright and matter-of-fact in telling Anna. Whareparita feels no need to divulge the father's identity to her as he will not be part of the baby's life, the baby which she and her community of Maori relatives will happily raise. This view is supported by the Chief, who happily will welcome another child into their community. Marriage to the father is not even an issue for Whareparita or her family. Anna is appalled and shocked by the entire situation.Abercrombie talks to Anna about the book, of which he wants to print several copies as a pilot project with the blessing of the school's council. Anna is shocked but pleased, but she will not allow them to make the editorial changes they want without the children's permission.After their latest encounter when Anna once again pushed Paul away as he declared his love for her, Paul, late one evening, is drunk, driving his motorcycle on a country road, when he crashes over a hill. He is killed as his motorcycle bursts into flames. At Paul's funeral, Whareparita collapses into tears. Anna then knows that Paul is the one who got Whareparita pregnant, which Whareparita later admits. Anna is in remorse about Paul, she feeling that his death could have been suicide, and that she could have saved him by giving into his wants. Abercrombie knows his death was accidental and that Anna's feeling of guilt is not justified. He admits to her that he loves her and plans to divorce his wife, even if she doesn't want one. Anna, ready to give herself to a man, hugs him.Abercrombie and Anna are walking side by side at the school, Abercrombie happily whistling as Anna goes into her classroom."

Harrison, that it makes sense to refurbish the Liberty ships docked in New York Harbor rather than junk them, Harrison who plans to take a tax loss in doing so. Gilbert's initiative is in he wanting to prove to Harrison that he is husband material for his daughter, Elinor Harrison, they awaiting her father's approval before getting married. As much as he is frustrated by Harrison usually dismissing him, Gilbert is more frustrated by Elinor's no sex before marriage policy. Without telling Harrison, Gilbert proceeds to hire Atlantic Marine Shipfitters to refurbish one of the ships for a few thousand dollars to show that it can be done inexpensively and thus should be done. What Gilbert is unaware of is that he inadvertently hired a group of criminals instead led by Bugsy G. Foglemeyer who wants to steal the ship to commit a crime to end all crimes in Boston, as such he going down in the annals of history for carrying out the perfect crime. Much like Gilbert's, Bugsy's aim is to prove himself to the world, he up to this point as hapless as Gilbert in life in general. In sailing from New York to Boston, Bugsy, who, in addition to his criminal gang, has brought along his vivacious girlfriend Virginia and his naive nephew Rodney along for the ride, the latter who had no idea of his uncle's criminal plans. In the process, Bugsy has to kidnap both Gilbert and Elinor to take along on that voyage to Boston. Above the planned crime and Gilbert and Elinor trying to escape, what plays out in their collective confinement aboard ship is is a battle of the sexes within and between both couples as an impending hurricane threatens all else.—Huggo"

Berger is confronted in the office by one of the robbers, who holds him at gunpoint and demands the cash. Berger weighs his options, thinking of his wife and son, and gives him the money.The rest of the film deals with the public's opinions on what is bravery and what is cowardice.

A Song About the Gray Pigeon,1961,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0232416/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"During the WW2 a group of Slovak children goes a trip on the mountains with their teacher. The war through the eyes of children from a small village in the middle of Slovakia in a set of micro-stories, limited by the time from the outbreak of the Slovak National Uprising to the first post-war days.The leitmotif is an injured wild pigeon who gets shot down with a slingshot by one of the boys on a school outing in the mountains (Vinco) and another boy (Rudko) who is taking care of him until it gets healed and released back into nature. The gray pigeon accompanies the main characters throughout the whole movie and is a certain symbol of hope in war times.There are only a few war movies that can be described as a mixture of beautiful and poetic and rough and unforgiving at the same time. The director however avoids scenes of explicit violence and gore despite some chilling moments that keep the viewer at the edge of the seat.Scenes like the teacher turning once again Nazi collaborator after the first shootout with the Germans and subsequently getting shot in the back by one of his students with a rifle from the distance or a woman giving birth to a child in a burnt-out house being helped by a Russian partisan while a troop of Nazi soldiers is combing through the surroundings, really stun the audience! Even the little boys singing and caroling, unfortunately, cannot distract the troops from locating the whereabouts of the two women.Amazing, even almost magnificent camera by Vladimir Jesina and his views, including vistas and soffits, sensitive screenplay by Albert Marencin and Ivan Bukovcan, and especially an excellent selection of actors make this one of the most suggestive and interesting Slovak movie works of all time. It's almost unbelievable that in the case of Stanislav Barabas it was his debut as a director.All the children actors deserve praise and admiration, but most of all Pavol Mattos in the role of a bit of a rebel Vinco, the sexton's son. Pavol Mattos was able to perfectly portray the transformation from a child to an adult man.A nice children's war movie with a sad ending - running into a minefield shortly after the war in order to set the pigeon free at the spot where it was caught does not bode well for one of the main protagonists."

Accordingly, he shows little understanding for people with strong or unpopular political views, such as Walter, a patient, and Rolf, his own son. Indeed, when Rolf joins the communists in resisting the Nazis, Mamlock throws him out of his house. As the persecution of Jews intensifies during the 1930s, Mamlock's own daughter is targeted for anti-Semitic attacks at her school. Professor Mamlock, however, refuses to believe her, and at work he disregards the anti-Semitism of his colleague, Dr. Hellpach. By 1938, however, anti-Jewish racial laws demand Mamlock's removal from office. He is physically marched from the hospital by Nazi guards, leaving him shocked to realize that his German citizenship has been revoked.

The Liar,1961,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0055111/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Mr. Schumann tells his little daughter a lot of lies about himself, so she can be proud of her father. When the wife of Sebastian Schumann left her family, he told his little daughter that her mother has died, because he thought that this was the easiest way for her to accept that her mother is now gone. But this was only the beginning of a lot of lies he tells her continuously, mostly about himself and his job. This way he also tries to hide away from her the fact that he had to quit his job as a traveler and is now paid much less than before.—Michael Zink Sebastian Schuhmann is a little man with a big problem. His wife deserted him, as well as their daughter, several years earlier. Since that traumatic event, he has attempted to create a good home for his daughter, and deal with the present in the best way he knows how. The lies began innocently, when he simply wanted to explain his wife's disappearance to his daughter, Nicky, by saying she died. So he took her to a cemetery, and followed the procession of a funerary burial at the very end, asserting to his daughter that the closest relatives always walk at the end.One of the consequences of his wife's desertion is that he can no longer be a traveling salesman for the porcelain company he's represented. Now he works for them as a bookkeeper, making a fraction of the salary he used to make. So he is lonely, and he is becoming poorer, and he has started drinking in order to cope with the pain of his existence. Since life is miserable for him, he begins to spin a web of lies for his little girl, in order to make her life more bearable and pleasant.When a rich schoolmate brags about the car and chauffeur that picks her up, little Nicky says her father has a car, too. The little girl calls her a liar. Nicky tells her father, who immediately takes steps to make sure his daughter is not going to be thought of as a liar! He begs for the company car, which turns out not to be a dignified vehicle, so he tries to rent a car, but doesn't have the required down payment, and ultimately, he pretends to buy a car, just to steal it for a short period to pick Nicky up from school.There are other lies: Nicky's father is a world diplomat; he is an astronaut; he was a foreign spy and barely got away with his life; he's a financier; and he's a world-class boxer. Each of these stories come just at a time when Nicky needs some reassurance that a mother would have given in another way. She is happy and satisfied. Her father has to start selling the family furniture to feed his little girl -- who remains blissfully unaware of their condition.A chance meeting at the automat with another woman, during which he steals her apple cake, leads to a romantic relationship with Sebastian. It does not take Annemarie long to figure out what's going on, and she scolds Sebastian for the world he's painting for his daughter. Since he has lost his job with his employer over the car incident, she gives him the opportunity to use his remarkable selling skills in the department store where she works. Sebastian, however, feels he needs some liquid courage to face a new employer, and arrives at his interview in a drunken condition.His drinking has not eluded the neighbors, one of whom is particularly nosy and judmental. This pinched woman reports him to the authorities, claiming, among other things, that he leaves Nicky in the park all day while he works -- which is true -- and that he is not fit to be a parent.The last part of the film is a culmination of events, some brought into focus by Annemarie, some by pure chance, that lead to a satisfactory ending."
