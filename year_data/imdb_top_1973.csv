The Exorcist,1973,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070047/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"When a young girl is possessed by a mysterious entity, her mother seeks the help of two Catholic priests to save her life. A visiting actress in Washington, D.C., notices dramatic and dangerous changes in the behavior and physical make-up of her 12-year-old daughter. Meanwhile, a young priest at nearby Georgetown University begins to doubt his faith while dealing with his mother's terminal sickness. And a frail, elderly priest recognizes the necessity for a show-down with an old demonic enemy.—Andrew Harmon <aharmon@erols.com> Georgetown, Washington, D.C. Regan, the once happy 12-year-old daughter of successful actress Chris MacNeil, shows signs of erratic behaviour. And soon, things get out of hand. As a result, Regan becomes violent, forcing the desperate mother to seek spiritual help. But there are forces beyond our comprehension. And as weary Father Merrin and his sceptical assistant perform an intricate purification ritual to rid the girl of the disturbing symptoms, sheer supernatural terror threatens their lives and souls. Can the exorcist confront pure darkness and evil incarnate?—Nick Riganas Accompanied by her 12-year-old daughter Regan, actress Chris MacNeil relocates to Washington D.C. where she is filming a movie. Mother and daughter have a good relationship, but after a time Regan begins to act strangely. She undergoes various neurological tests, but doctors can find nothing to explain her behavior. As Regan's situation reaches crisis proportions, Chris turns to Father Karras, a Roman Catholic priest and psychiatrist, to see if an exorcism might solve their problem. Karras is incredulous, but the church eventually agrees calling in Father Merrin, who had previously conducted an exorcism and came face to face with the demon.—garykmcd A movie actress taking up temporary residence in Washington D.C. has her troubles. The script for the movie she's filming seems inadequate. Her ex, who is also the father of her adolescent daughter, Regan, neglects to call the girl on her birthday. And the attic has rats. Meanwhile, Father Karras, a priest and a psychiatrist, is losing his faith; and he's dealing with a sick mother who needs medical care he hasn't the money to provide. Another priest, the old and ailing Father Merrin, has just returned from Iraq with forebodings of evil. These three persons meet when the sweet and cheerful Regan turns foul-mouthed and violent. But her sickness is beyond the reach of a medical doctor or a psychiatrist. What Regan needs is an exorcist.—J. Spurlin Father Lancaster Merrin (Max von Sydow) is an elderly Catholic priest on an archaeological dig in Iraq. Merrin has a sense of foreboding and encounters a number of strange omens. Finally, Merrin discovers a statue of a bizarre demonic figure; a representation of a demonic figure known as Pazuzu.Back in the United States, in Washington D.C.'s upscale Georgetown neighborhood, a successful actress named Chris MacNeil (Ellen Burstyn) begins experiencing strange phenomena. Chris lives with her twelve-year-old daughter Regan (Linda Blair), her personal assistant Sharon (Kitty Winn), and two housekeepers. Regan's father is estranged for reasons unknown. There are mysterious, unexplained sounds in the attic of the house, which Chris attributes to rats. Regan slowly begins to exhibit strange behavior, undergoing behavioral changes much like depression and anxiety. She turns up in Chris's bed one night, complaining that her own bed was ""shaking"".Chris is working on a movie in Georgetown with a director named Burke Dennings (Jack MacGowran). While filming a scene one day, she notices a young Catholic priest watching her; his name is Damien Karras (Jason Miller). Father Karras has a background in psychology and counsels parishioners at a nearby church; Chris also notices him while walking home from the shoot one day.Karras is a thoughtful, conflicted man. He discusses his vocation with a superior and asks to be transferred because he feels he is losing his faith. He also has an elderly mother who lives alone in a slum in New York; he visits her and is reminded of how lonely her life is, and he feels guilty that she has to live in such poor surroundings.The strange occurrences in the MacNeil house begin to increase. Regan reveals that she has been playing with a Ouija board and claims that she has the ability to communicate with a spiritual entity all by herself. A nearby Catholic church is desecrated, a statue of the Virgin Mary painted crudely and adorned with conical clay additions made to resemble breasts and a penis. Regan also works with clay and paint, making small animal sculptures.Meanwhile, Father Karras's mother falls ill and, due to a lack of funds, she is placed in a very shabby hospital and resigned to a ward full of mental patients. Father Karras is distraught when he visits her and she seems to blame him for her situation. Later, she passes away under these conditions, adding to his sorrow.Chris has an elaborate party at her home with a number of affluent guests. One of her guests is another Jesuit named Father Dyer (FatherWilliam O'Malley), and Chris asks him about Karras, having noticed him and referring to him as ""intense"". She finds that Karras and Dyer are good friends. During the party, Regan appears happy and social, but she reappears after being sent to bed, dressed in her nightgown and urinates on the carpet in front of the guests while making an ominous statement to a prominent astronaut (""You're gonna die up there""). After the guests leave, Chris bathes Regan and puts her to bed, but is startled by a loud sound from Regan's bedroom. She rushes back down the hall and discovers Regan's bed shaking violently, rising up off the floor with Regan on it.Chris subjects Regan to a series of medical tests to discover what the problem is. The doctors are unable to discover anything, despite putting Regan through some grueling, painful procedures. The best they can come up with is that Regan may have a lesion on her brain, but ultimately they are frustrated when nothing appears on her brain scan. At Chris's house, Regan suffers what appears to be a seizure, and two doctors visit to assist. They find her rising and falling up and down on the bed in a way that seems impossible for a human being. When they try to sedate her, she hurls them across the room with abnormal strength, speaking to them in what seems to be a male voice: ""Keep away! The sow is mine!"" Eventually they sedate her.Out of options, the doctors advise Chris to search for a psychiatrist. The situation then worsens when Chris is out one evening; she returns to find the house deserted except for Regan, who is alone in her bedroom and appears to be in deep sleep. The bedroom is freezing cold, the window standing wide open, and she is uncovered. Sharon returns and Chris is furious with her for leaving Regan unattended, but Sharon explains that she left Regan in the care of Burke, who was visiting the house, while she went to the pharmacy to get Regan's medication. Burke's absence is unexplained until the doorbell rings and an associate of Chris's breaks the news that Burke has just died on the steps outside Chris's house.The following day, Karras is approached by a detective named Lt. Kinderman (Lee J. Cobb), who questions him about the fact that the desecration of the church could be connected to Burke's death. He tells Karras that Burke's body was found with his head turned completely around, and the police department considers it a homicide.After a failed session with a psychiatrist, the doctors reluctantly discuss another possibility with Chris: they mention the phenomenon of demonic possession and the rite of exorcism. While they seem to hold professional contempt for it, they do admit that it has been known to solve problems such as what Regan is going through. Chris is skeptical, having no real religious affiliation of her own.Shortly after this, Chris is visited by Kinderman. He questions Chris about the events of the evening of Burke's death, and Chris is nervous, hesitant to tell him about Regan's problem. While he is visiting, he notices a few small animal figures that Regan has crafted; they are similar in style to the desecration of the statue in the church. Kinderman leaves and immediately a violent disturbance comes from Regan's bedroom. Chris hears a deep male voice bellowing at Regan to ""do it"", and Regan screaming in protest. In the bedroom, Chris finds Regan plunging a crucifix violently into her vagina. When Chris tries to stop her, Regan assaults her with impossible strength, and furniture around the room starts to move on its own. As Chris watches in horror, her daughter's head turns completely around backwards, and she speaks to Chris in Burke's voice. Chris then realizes that Regan is responsible for Burke's death.Desperate, Chris arranges to meet with Father Karras, and when she mentions the notion of exorcism, Karras is almost amused. He tells her that exorcism is nearly unheard of, and that he doesn't know anybody who has ever performed one. Chris is distraught and convinces him to meet with Regan anyway. Karras is shocked by the girl's appearance; she is tied to the headboard of her bed, her face misshapen and covered in lesions, her voice deep and gravelly. Regan announces that she's the devil, and toys with Karras in a number of ways, seeming to make a drawer next to the bed open all by itself, then speaking to Karras in a number of languages. She also conjures up the voice of a subway vagrant that Karras has encountered alone earlier. Karras remains unconvinced, and when Regan claims ""Your mother's in here with us"", Karras asks her what his mother's maiden name is. Unable to answer, Regan vomits spectacularly all over him.Chris cleans Karras's sweater and discusses Regan with him. Karras is still not convinced that Regan is possessed, especially because Regan says she's ""the devil"", and he recommends psychiatric care for her. Chris pleads with him to help her obtain an exorcism, swearing that the ""thing"" in the bed upstairs is not her daughter.Karras visits Regan again and records their conversation, during which he sprinkles Regan with water. He tells her it is holy water and she begins to writhe in pain, seemingly going into a trance and speaking in a strange language. Later he tells Chris that it will be difficult to make a case with the Bishop for possession; the water he sprinkled on Regan was simply tap water, and was not blessed. The Bishop, and Karras himself, would consider Regan to be mentally ill and not possessed. Chris confides in Karras and tells him that Regan was the one who killed Burke Dennings. Later, Karras uses his tape recordings of Regan's seemingly incomprehensible babble to discover that she is really speaking backwards, in English. A phone call from Sharon interrupts him; she summons him to the house to see Regan, not wanting Chris to see that's happening: as they look at Regan's unconscious body, the words ""help me"" begin to materialize on her stomach, rising up in her skin like scar tissue.Karras reluctantly agrees to try and get an exorcism for Regan, although he seems to have more in common with the doctors who recommended it as a form of shock therapy. The church calls in Father Merrin to perform the exorcism, with Karras assisting. Merrin has performed exorcisms in the past, including a difficult one that ""nearly killed him"", according to the Bishop. When Merrin arrives at the MacNeil house, Regan bellows his name from upstairs, as if she knows him, and she makes strange animal sounds. He warns Karras about conversing with the demon, and reminds him that the demon will mix lies with the truth to confuse and attack them.When they enter Regan's bedroom, she immediately begins with a string of obscenities. Merrin and Karras recite the ritual of exorcism and Regan manifests strange phenomena such as levitation, telekinesis, an abnormally long tongue, and strange vomiting. She constantly curses the priests and emits evil laughter and verbal abuse. Regan begins to talk to Karras in the voice of his mother, and he starts to break down. Merrin sends him away; when he returns, he finds Merrin dead on the floor, the victim of a heart attack. Regan cackles gleefully, infuriating Karras, who grabs her and shouts at the demon, ""Come into me! Take me!"" The transference works almost immediately; Karras begins to transform and Regan returns to her normal self. Before Karras can harm her, his ""normal"" personality breaks through for a split second and he commits suicide, hurling himself out Regan's window. Just as Burke did, he tumbles down the stairs outside Regan's window and lays dying in the street below. By chance, Father Dyer happens upon the scene and administers the last rites to his friend.In a brief epilogue, we see Chris and Regan as they prepare to leave the house in Georgetown. They are visited by Father Dyer. Chris speaks with him privately and tells him that Regan doesn't remember anything about the possession or the exorcism. Regan then appears and greets him cheerfully, transfixed by Father Dyer's white collar. Before they leave, she suddenly hugs Father Dyer and kisses him. As Chris pulls away in their car, she orders the driver to stop for a moment and gives Father Dyer the religious medallion that belonged to Father Karras. After she and Regan drive away, Dyer pauses at the top of the stone steps before walking away."
The Sting,1973,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070735/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Two grifters team up to pull off the ultimate con. Johnny Hooker, a small time grifter, unknowingly steals from Doyle Lonnegan, a big time crime boss, when he pulls a standard street con. Lonnegan demands satisfaction for the insult. After his partner, Luther, is killed, Hooker flees, and seeks the help of Henry Gondorff, one of Luther's contacts, who is a master of the long con. Hooker wants to use Gondorff's expertise to take Lonnegan for an enormous sum of money to even the score, since he admits he ""doesn't know enough about killing to kill him."" They devise a complicated scheme and amass a talented group of other con artists who want their share of the reparations. The stakes are high in this game, and our heroes must not only deal with Lonnegan's murderous tendencies, but also other side players who want a piece of the action. To win, Hooker and Gondorff will need all their skills...and a fair amount of confidence.—headlessannie Following the murder of a mutual friend, aspiring con man Johnny Hooker teams up with old pro Henry Gondorff to take revenge on the ruthless crime boss responsible, Doyle Lonnegan. Hooker and Gondorff set about implementing an elaborate scheme, one so crafty that Lonnegan won't even know he's been swindled. As their big con unfolds, however, things don't go according to plan, requiring some last-minute improvisation by the undaunted duo.—Jwelch5742 When the gang are coming up with a way to get Lonnegan, Kid Twist mentions that Riley and Cole are the only torpedoes they know of. Then how did they know that Loretta Salino was also a torpedo after she was shot by the guy sent by Gondorff?—Frank Johnny Hooker is a young con-man who is being taught by Luther. One day they pull one of their con jobs and net themselves a huge roll. What they don't know is that the man they conned is the courier for a numbers runner. And it turns out that the boss, Doyle Lonigan, considers it an attack on him and orders all the people involved terminated. Hooker is shaken down by a crooked cop, Snyder, who threatens to turn him over to Lonigan unless he pays him off. Hooker pays him, he then tries to warn Luther but is too late. He then goes to see Henry Gondorf, a friend of Luther's and a one time great con-man, who has had a bit of bad luck. After hearing what happened to Luther and seeing how hungry Hooker is for payback, he assembles a gang and decides to con Lonigan. While everything seems to be going ok, there is just the problem of the hit on Hooker and Snyder, whom Hooker paid off with counterfeit money.—rcs0411@yahoo.com It is 1936 and a money runner is carrying the week's take -- $11,000 -- from an illegal gambling outfit in Joliet, Illinois, to the main office. On the way, three men con him by replacing his money with tissue paper. Doyle Lonnegan (Robert Shaw), the mobster who was supposed to get the money, exacts revenge by having one of the con men, Luther Coleman (Robert Earl Jones), killed when his men push him out a window. Lonnegan also orders a hit on Luther's partner, Johnny Hooker (Robert Redford). Hooker goes to Chicago to escape Lonnegan's wrath. In Chicago he meets Henry Gondorff (Paul Newman), an old friend of Luther's. Out for revenge for Luther's death, they set up an elaborate plan -- a ""long con"" -- to swindle an enormous sum out of Lonnegan so neatly that he won't even realize he's been conned.Posing as an obnoxious gambling boss from Chicago, Gondorff gets into a high-stakes poker game with Lonnegan, who is known to cheat. Lonnegan, flustered by the first round of play, orders one of his men to replace the deck with one stacked with threes and nines, his preferred hand. Despite the stacked deck, Gondorff cheats better and wins $15,000 from Lonnegan. Lonnegan can't pay it right away because his wallet is missing. (One of Gondorff's associates picked his pocket before the game.) Gondorff sends Hooker to Lonnegan's cabin to pick up the money. Hooker, playing Gondorff's resentful second-in-command, tells Lonnegan he has a great plan to con Gondorff, but he needs ""someone respectable"" to place the bets. Lonnegan, furious at being out-cheated, bites.Gondorff and company do a lot of fast work to get ready for the final phase of the long con. First they assemble a mob and rent an empty basement, transforming it in a couple of days into a prosperous gambling parlor. An announcer (Ray Walston) in a back room describes horse races as if they were happening live -- but he's reading from a ticker tape, so the results are known in advance. They choose a race with odds they like -- maybe 3:1 or 4:1 -- and call in a tip (a particular horse or horses to win, place, or show) to the pay phone at the corner drugstore, where Lonnegan is waiting. Gondorff's gang has also rented a room with a view of the corner drugstore; when Lonnegan comes out on his way to the gambling den, a watcher rings a buzzer to warn them he's coming. They run through this once with a fairly small bet to show Lonnegan the system will work; the final plan they give Lonnegan calls for a bet so large it will ruin Gondorff. They run into trouble when Lonnegan demands to meet Hooker's imaginary accomplice. Hooker has told Lonnegan the key to the scam is his friend at Western Union who gives him race results by phone before they're released over the wire. The skeptical Lonnegan, however, wants proof. Pretending to be painters, the gang tricks a genuine Western Union manager into vacating his office for an hour, and one of them poses as the manager. Lonnegan is convinced.Meanwhile, Lonnegan's goons have tracked Hooker to Chicago but failed to kill him. (They -- and Lonnegan -- have no idea that the man Lonnegan is ""helping"" to con Gondorff is the same guy who helped Luther take the runner's money at the beginning of the movie.) Lonnegan assigns the job to someone called Solino, who, it's implied, is a very skilled assassin.Lt. Snyder (Charles Durning), a Joliet cop, has pursued Hooker to the big city because Hooker gave Snyder counterfeit cash when Snyder tried to shake him down. Snyder isn't getting very far; when Hooker can't stay out of Snyder's way entirely, he can outrun him. Snyder is induced to assist FBI Agent Polk (Dana Elcar), who's after Gondorff. Snyder collars Hooker and brings him to Polk, who pressures him to give up Gondorff by threatening to lock up Luther's wife. Hooker, who was close to Luther's family, gives in, provided the FBI will let the Lonnegan con run its course before arresting Gondorff.The night before the final act of the con, Hooker hooks up with Loretta (Dimitra Arliss), the new waitress at the diner where he likes to eat. When he wakes up, she's gone. He's somewhat puzzled to find that she hasn't robbed him. He dresses, fits something we don't get a good look at over his back teeth, and goes out. A man whom we've seen only glimpses of before now is stalking Hooker with a gun. As Hooker walks down a sunlit alley and spots Loretta coming toward him, smiling, the armed man emerges behind him and shoots -- hitting Loretta neatly in the middle of the forehead. She drops a handgun as she falls. Hooker, stunned, listens to the gunman's explanation that Loretta Solino is ""a pro"" -- a hired killer -- and she hadn't killed him the night before because witnesses had seen him entering her apartment. To Hooker's bewildered ""Who are you?"", the gunman replies ""Gondorff asked me to look after you.""Lonnegan, with half a million dollars in a suitcase, receives his tip in the drugstore and goes to Gondorff's gambling parlor to place the bet. The betting clerk needs Gondorff's approval to accept such a large bet; there's some taunting and snarling between Gondorff and Lonnegan before Gondorff accepts it. Lonnegan sits down to listen to the race. He's joined by Kid Twist (Harold Gould), the faux Western Union manager who's been calling in Lonnegan's tips. When Lonnegan mentions that he bet on the tipped horse to win, Kid Twist, shocked, tells him the bet should have been to place, not to win. In a panic, Lonnegan tries to rescind the wager, but it's too late.While Lonnegan is shouting, the FBI bursts in to arrest Gondorff. Having secured the mastermind, his prize, Polk tells Hooker he can go. Hooker throws a guilty look at Gondorff and starts to slink away, but Gondorff pulls a gun and shoots him in the back. Polk shoots Gondorff. Lonnegan, standing nearby, can see that Hooker is bleeding from the mouth; both men look quite dead. Lt. Snyder, whose job is to get Lonnegan away as quickly as possible, duly hustles him out, telling him he doesn't want to be mixed up with dead bodies. Lonnegan is distraught, saying he left a half million dollars inside.Back in the gambling den, good cheer reigns. The dead have risen and are congratulating one another and their many accomplices -- including the erstwhile FBI agents -- for a job well done. The set is already being disassembled; Gondorff tells the mobsters where to pick up their share of the take and he and Hooker leave together."
American Graffiti,1973,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0069704/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A group of teenagers in California's central valley spend one final night after their 1962 high school graduation cruising the strip with their buddies before they pursue their varying goals. It's the proverbial end of the summer 1962 in a small Northern California town. It's the evening before best friends and recent high school graduates, Curt Henderson and Steve Bolander, are scheduled to leave town to head to college back east. Curt, who received a lucrative local scholarship, is seen as the promise that their class holds. But Curt is having second thoughts about leaving what Steve basically sees as their dead end town. Curt's beliefs are strengthened when he spots an unknown beautiful blonde in a T-bird who mouths the words ""I love you"" to him. As Curt tries to find that blonde while trying to get away from a local gang who have him somewhat hostage, Curt may come to a decision about his immediate future. Outgoing class president Steve, on the other hand, wants to leave, despite meaning that he will leave girlfriend, head cheerleader and Curt's sister, Laurie Henderson, behind. Steve and Laurie spend the evening ""negotiating"" the state of their relationship. Meanwhile, two of their friends cruise around town for the evening. Steve has left his car to meek and mild-mannered Terry ""Toad"" Fields to look after during his absence. The wheels give Toad a new sense of confidence, which he uses to try and impress Debbie Dunham, a more experienced girl generally out of his league. And John Milner, who is seen as the king of the street race in his souped-up yellow deuce coupe, tries to get rid of precocious pre-teen, Carol Morrison, who has somehow become his passenger for the evening, while dealing with the challenge of bold out-of-towner, Bob Falfa.—Huggo American Graffiti takes place in what feels like real time between one evening and sunup of the next morning in California 1962. A group of friends spend one last night as summer vacation ends, each of them dealing with some sort of dilemma - whether major, like doubts about leaving home for college, or minor, like getting a date with a cute girl. Everything takes place against backdrops such as a burger drive-in, a high school dance, a downtown 'cruising' strip, or other places all of which have a totally authentic feel for the place and time. By sunup the next morning, everyone has their issues sorted out and we are left knowing what happens to each of them in the months and years to come.—Grid Maule Jr. In the twilight of innocence, and against the backdrop of early-1960s Modesto, California, four school friends--Curt, Steve, John, and Terry--bid farewell to their carefree lives as teenagers, on the last evening of summer break. Over the course of one long and hot September night, the long-time companions on the brink of adulthood will take their first steps into the real life; experience the powerful feelings of desire, disappointment, and love--and, ultimately--see the world in a different light. Pivoting around Mel's bright Drive-In, andWolfman Jack's non-stop Rock 'n' Roll disc-jockey show, the boys cruise the town's colourful streets in their beautiful cars, as an elusive blonde vision in a white 1956 Ford Thunderbird contributes to the excitement of this very special night. However, when morning comes, nothing will ever be the same again.—Nick Riganas Features the coming of age of four teenagers on their last summer night before college. Rediscover drag racing, Insipiration Point and drive-ins all over again in this nostalgic looks at the 60's. The incredible soundtrack brings you the most memorable rock 'n' roll hits of the era. It's the last night of summer in 1962, and a number of friends are meeting at Burger City for one last hurrah. They include:-Steve Bolander (Ron Howard), The recently-graduated Class President.-Curt Henderson (Richard Dreyfuss), another recent graduate and Steve's best friend, who was awarded the local Moose Lodge's first scholarship.-Laurie Henderson (Cindy Williams), who is heading into her Senior Year in high school, and was the head cheerleader, as well as Steve Bolander's girlfriend. She is also Curt's younger sister.-Terry ""The Toad"" Fields (Charles Martin Smith), a rather nerdish and socially awkward kid with glasses and a mutual friend of Steve and Curt.-John Milner (Paul Le Mat), a young man and high school graduate in his early 20s who spends most of his days fixing cars for a living and racing a yellow deuce coupe, said by some to be the fastest car in the Valley.At Burger City, Curt confides to Steve that he is considering not heading East for college the next day. Steve is upset by this, but Curt feels that maybe he needs to get his feelings in order. After their discussion, Steve tells Terry that he is going to give him his 1958 Chevrolet Impala until he comes back from college. As Terry only has a little Vespa scooter, the opportunity to have a hot set of wheels makes him ecstatic.After the formalities, Steve gets into Laurie's car, and tells her that he thinks they should see other people while he is away. Laurie tries to hide the fact that this upsets her, but becomes very quiet considering the ramifications.Meanwhile, Curt and John talk about how it seems every girl that comes by is ugly or has a boyfriend. ""Where is the dazzling beauty I've been waiting for all my life?"" bemoans Curt. John's conversation turns to how the strip that they cruise on keeps shrinking, remembering when a tank full of gas was needed to complete a full circuit.It is then that the group decides to split up. John heads off cruising in his yellow deuce coupe, while Terry heads out in Steve's car. Curt decides to accompany Steve and Laurie to the ""Freshman Hop,"" a sock-hop in the school gymnasium.As Milner heads off to cruise around, he encounters a couple of his buddies also cruising down the streets, who tell him of a ""very wicked '55 Chevy looking for him,"" as well as alerting him to cops watching for speeders.Steve, Laurie and Curt have pulled up to a stop light, with a white '56 T-Bird next to them. As Curt looks, a blonde driving the vehicle smiles at him, and seems to mouth the words ""I love you,"" before taking off. Curt is taken by the vision of this 'goddess,' and pleads with his friend and sister to follow the Thunderbird. However, his words fall on deaf ears.Milner soon after encounters a Studebaker, full of girls. When he asks if any of them wants to ride with him, one of the girl's sisters volunteers. However, it is only after she gets into his car does he realize what he's gotten himself into. The girl, named Carol (Mackenzie Phillips), is easily a very young girl, and John is determined to not have her along with him for the rest of the night.Meanwhile, Steve, Laurie and Curt have made it to the sock-hop. Laurie's friend Peg (Kathleen Quinlan) confides that Laurie will be fine without Steve, but Laurie is still upset and confused about Steve's wish to see other people. Steve meanwhile, has explained his plans to some of his own friends, who laugh that he will use the opportunity to ""screw around."" Curt meanwhile, roams the halls of the school and comes across his old locker. He tries the combination, only to find that it has been changed.After Steve and Laurie meet up after talking to their friends, Steve wishes to dance, but Laurie refuses, her anger over his decision boiling to the surface. Curt meanwhile, meets one of his teachers who is chaperoning the dance. Mr. Wolfe (Terence McGovern) and Curt then discuss the teacher's past, how he went to a college in Middlebury, Vermont, and only stayed one semester. Wolfe contends that he wasn't the adventuresome type, and Curt explains how he might not be as well. The teacher encourages Curt to not stay, but to go out and explore life.Back in the yellow deuce coupe, John and Carol continue to be at odds with each other. Carol explains how she and her friends used shaving cream to coverup someone's windshield as a gag, and shows John that she still has a can with her at that moment. They then fight over the music on the radio, with John being irritated by the Beach Boys song ""Surfin' Safari"" on the radio. John's night is further complicated when Officer Holstein (Jim Bohan) pulls him over. Holstein gives Milner a ticket, claiming one of his taillights is out, and claims that he received reports of John speeding, but is going to let him go this time, promising that one day soon, he's going to catch him in the act. After Holstein leaves, John gives Carol the ticket to put in a pouch on the driver's side door, which already contains plenty of tickets from ""the law.""Terry meanwhile, has pulled up to a light, next to a black '55 Chevy. The driver is Bob Falfa (Harrison Ford), who shouts over to Terry that he's looking for John Milner, and to let John know that he's looking to race him. After the encounter with Falfa, Terry notices a blonde walking the streets. After saying that she resembles Connie Stevens, the girl stops to talk to Terry. Terry claims he's known as ""Terry the Tiger,"" and offers to let her feel the tuck-and-roll upholstery of the Impala. The girl, named Debbie (Candy Clark), gets in, and the two drive off.Back at the sock-hop, Steve and Laurie are chosen to lead a spotlight snowball dance, and put on smiling faces for the rest of the students. As they dance together, Laurie continues to argue quietly, before beginning to cry, and telling Steve to ""go to hell,"" as the song ""Smoke Gets In Your Eyes"" fills the gymnasium.Curt meanwhile, has run into his ex-girlfriend, Wendy (Deby Celiz). With nothing else to do at the school, he asks if he can tag along with her and her friend Bobbie (Lynne Marie Stewart). Wendy agrees, much to the ire of her friend.Back in the gymnasium, as the music picks back up, Steve and Laurie are now dancing intimately, when a teacher named Mr Kroot (Mark Anger) tells them to ""break it up."" Steve gets smart and tells Kroot to 'kiss a duck,' as well as calls him a 'marble-head.' Kroot tells Steve that he is suspended, but Steve smilingly tells Kroot that he graduated last semester, and by all accounts, Kroot can't do anything to him. As Kroot storms off, Steve and Laurie laugh at the moment. After the incident, they decide to go to The Canal to be alone, their relationship appearing to have been patched up.Terry meanwhile, has taken Debbie to Burger City to get food. As they wait, a former 'flame' of Debbie's leans into the car to talk to her. Debbie ignores all his advances, before flicking a lit match at him after making an obscene gesture at her. Debbie confides that the guy is just 'horny,' and that she likes Terry because he's different. As Terry's face develops a smile, Debbie tells Terry that she figures he's smart enough to get them some liquor. Seeing a new way to impress Debbie, Terry heads off to a liquor store, leaving behind the order they placed.Curt has now come to occupy the back seat of Bobbie's VW Bug, and Wendy in the passenger seat. Seeing the white T-Bird, Curt demands they follow it, much to Bobbie's irritation. When Wendy asks Curt who this girl in the T-Bird is, Curt says he has no idea. Bobbie meanwhile, claims that she's the wife of a guy who owns a jewelry store. Curt doesn't believe it, since the girl in the T-Bird is young and beautiful.Wendy confides to Bobbie about Curt's dream to be a Presidential Aide, and to one day shake hands with President Kennedy. Curt and Wendy then playfully bicker about telling of his future ambitions, and Curt invites her into the backseat to cuddle. Wendy then confides that she thinks Curt's decision to stay in town is a good idea, saying that maybe they can attend the local college together. Just then, Kip Pullman (Ed Greenberg) pulls up next to their car. Bobbie tells Curt to 'say anything' to Kip, whom she has a crush on and would like to meet. Curt then takes her request a bit too far, and yells over to Kips that Bobbie is madly in love with him, and trembles at the sight of his rippling biceps. This causes Bobbie to pull over immediately, demanding Curt to leave her car. Curt does so, and then sees the T-Bird off a ways. He chases after it, but it soon disappears, and he is unsure where to go or what to do next.John meanwhile, has given in to Carol's request for a drink, and takes her to Burger City for a Coke. While there, John meets one of his hot rod buddies, and explains that he's babysitting Carol. Carol gets upset and throws her drink at him, before storming out of the car. John lets her go for a bit, but then feels a sense of responsibility and catches up to Carol, who gets back into his coupe.Terry meanwhile, has gotten to the liquor store, but is unsure how to get a bottle of Old Harper for Debbie. As he ponders outside the store, a wino comes up, and Terry asks him to help. The wino takes Terry's money, but instead buys wine and exits out the back door of the store. Terry goes in, and runs off a list of things for the storekeeper to give him along with the bottle of Old Harper. However, the storekeeper still asks Terry for his ID. Terry returns to the car, now without the money, and asks Debbie for more. She is at first upset, but agrees. As Terry approaches the store again, he sees another man approaching. Terry explains his situation, and the man claims he will help Terry. However, seconds later, the man rushes out, and tosses Terry the bottle of Old Harper. The man appears to have robbed the store, and the store owner soon after emerges, firing on the man with a gun! Terry hightails it back to the Impala, and quickly gets out of there with Debbie.Meanwhile, John has taken Carol to an old junkyard, and gives her a run down of the various vehicles that he's known about, usually belonging to guys he's known who have long since died in crashes or accidents. Carol claims that John told her he's never been in an accident, but he confides that he's come close a couple of times, and that so far, none has been able to beat him.Curt meanwhile, has taken to sitting on the hood of a car, watching an episode of ""Ozzie and Harriet"" through the window of an appliance store. As he notices, several guys who are part of a gang called ""The Pharoahs"" accost him, claiming he's sitting on a car that belongs to a friend of theirs. When Curt gets off, one of the members tells Curt that he appears to have left a scratch in the hood. The guys then take Curt along with them in their car, deciding on a 'fitting punishment'. As Curt feels he is going to die, the white T-Bird passes by. Shortly thereafter. Falfa's '55 Chevy passes, and the leader of the Pharoahs claims that this guy aims to beat Milner, claiming John's days are numbered.Meanwhile, John and Carol encounter a white Cadillac, full of girls. The girls claim that John's car deserves their special prize. When John is eager to accept it, the girls hurl a water balloon at him, which misses and hits Carol. John bursts into laughter, but Carol wants revenge, and John seems eager to have a little mischief. As both cars come to the next red light, John proceeds to flatten the other car's tires, and Carol sprays shaving cream all over the other car's windows, before the two jump back into John's car and drive off.Terry and Debbie have made it to the Canal, where Terry mixes up the Old Harper with some soda. Terry and Debbie attempt to get intimate, but there appear to be too many people walking around. Terry leaves the car door open and the music on, and he and Debbie go looking for a quiet place to be alone.Curt and the Pharoahs pull into a miniature golf establishment, where the Pharoahs attempt to pry open the pinball machines in the main building for gas money. They are soon caught by Mr. Gordon (Scott Beach), who is a member of the Moose Lodge in town. Curt claims that the guys he is with are his friends, and Gordon takes Curt into the back to meet with another Moose Lodge member named Hank (Al Nalbandian). They both congratulate Curt on winning the Lodge's first scholarship, before he takes leave along with the Pharoahs, who have finished cleaning out the change in the pinball machines. The leader of the Pharoahs is impressed with how Curt handled the situation, and decides that he and his friends will consider making Curt one of them.Back at the Canal, Terry stops necking with Debbie, when he realizes the music from the car has stopped. He and Debbie then return to where the car was, only to find that it has been stolen!Meanwhile, in another part of the Canal, Steve and Laurie are getting intimate in her car. The conversation shifts a little towards Steve's decision of wanting to go, and how Curt does not. The talk again upsets Laurie, and she stops giving in to Steve's advances. When he claims he wants something to remember her by, she goes limp, infuriating him more that she is just going to let him do whatever but she isn't going to take any pleasure out of it. When Steve makes an off hand comment about Laurie watching her brother 'doing something,' Laurie yells at Steve ""You're disgusting!"" and kicks him out of the car, before driving off.Terry and Debbie are walking near the canal, with Debbie explaining about reports of a person in the area dubbed ""The Goat Killer,"" who kills and dismembers his victims. Terry is getting more and more freaked out by her talking, when a noise distracts them. At first thinking it might be the goat killer, Terry is relieved when it turns out to be Steve. When Debbie explains that their car was stolen, Terry attempts to divert the subject (not wanting Steve to know that ""his"" car was stolen).Back with John and Carol, John attempts to trick Carol into telling where she lives, to try and take her home, but Carol is stubborn, claiming she isn't going home until she ""gets some action."" It is then that Bob Falfa's car pulls alongside John, and the two trade barbs, with Bob insisting on racing John. They do a small race through several lights before John stops at a red light and Bob continues on through. Carol notes that Bob is fast, but John says that while he is fast, he also seems stupid.Meanwhile, Steve separates from Terry and Debbie, and goes back to Burger City, while Terry and Debbie go off to report the car stolen.Curt and the Pharoahs have meanwhile located a police car watching for speeders. The leader of the Pharoahs charges Curt with hooking a tow cable to the rear axle of the car. Curt is unsure about this, but is told that he has to do this, or the Pharoahs will still plan to make him suffer for the vehicle he scratched. Curt has some close calls, but eventually gets the cable hooked. As he rushes back to the Pharoahs, they then speed by the officers, with Curt yelling at the top of his lungs, ""Stand by for justice!"" The cops then take off, but the cable catches, tearing the rear axle off their car. Prepared for shock and awe, the two cops turn around, speechlessly looking at the torn off rear axle of their car. Nearby, Terry and Debbie are witnesses to the incident as well.Carol soon finds herself confused when John takes her along a dark stretch of road, and John seems intent on having his way with her. Carol's spitfire demeanor wavers and she insists that much of her toughness was pretend. John explains that if he knew where she lived, he could take her home, and Carol immediately tells him her address. Of course, John was hoping that his 'trick' would work, and they head off for Carol's place.At Burger City, Steve meets up with a waitress named Budda (Jana Bellan). Budda takes a moment to talk with Steve, who explains about how he and Laurie broke up. Budda takes this opportunity to tell Steve how she secretly likes him, and offers to have him come over to her place after her shift is over. As they talk, both are unaware that Laurie has returned to Burger City as well and is outside, having stopped at seeing Budda and Steve talking in a booth. Laurie assumes the worst, and quickly leaves before they see her. Back inside the restaurant, Steve declines Budda's offer, and watches her get back to work.Outside, The Pharaohs pull up with Curt, and eagerly applaud what he has done. The Pharaohs are eager to induct Curt the next evening into their group, but Curt does not tell them that he'll be gone. Curt then gets into his car, and sees the white T-Bird pass by. He tries to start up his car, but it won't turn over, and he watches once again as the mysterious blonde slips from his grasp once more.Laurie is cruising around the strip when she encounters Bob Falfa. She parks her car and gets in with him, and they begin to cruise. Falfa attempts to talk with her, but Laurie explains she does not want to talk.John finally gets Carol to her place, and they have an awkward goodbye, until John gives her the cover to his gearshift as a memento. Carol happily takes it and goes to her house, as John drives off, a strange look on his face.Back at Burger City, Curt has run into Steve, and is shocked when Steve explains that he is now considering not going to college out East. Curt attempts to calm Steve, but also ends up fixing his car, and takes off, leaving Steve unsure of what to do now.Meanwhile, Terry has had an adverse reaction to the alcohol, and has thrown up most of it. After Terry recovers, he and Debbie walk a ways off, and find Steve's Impala parked in a lot! Terry finds the car unlocked and the keys gone. He attempts to hot-wire the car when the guys who stole it confront him, and attempt to beat him up. Debbie attempts to stop them, but they are both saved when John rolls by, comes over and scares away the two men.Back at Burger City, another classmate of Steve's tells him that Laurie was seen riding around with Bob Falfa. Just as Terry and Debbie pull up outside Burger City with his car, Steve rushes out and shoos Terry and Debbie out of his car, and drives off. Debbie is shocked that Steve just took Terry's car, and Terry tells her the truth about how the car wasn't really his, and how he just has a Vespa Scooter for transportation. Even so, Debbie smiles and tells Terry that she had a good time, and as she takes leave, tells him that she'll probably see him around.Curt meanwhile, has made his way to a radio station on the outskirts of town. Rumor is that Wolfman Jack, whose voice has played across the airwaves all evening, is located here. As Curt enters the station, he encounters a bearded man sitting in the control booth. Curt hands the man a piece of paper featuring a dedication and a request to the girl in the white T-Bird. The man explains that he can have the dedication sent into the Wolfman's main station and broadcast the next day. But Curt explains that he needs the request put out tonight, as he is unsure if he is going to be leaving town or not.The man in the control booth then explains to Curt that he really should not sell himself short, and to go out and experience life. Curt takes the words to heart, and is excited when the man tells him if he can, he'll try to get the message relayed right away. As Curt is about to exit the studio, he hears a familiar voice. He turns, and sees the man in the control booth speaking into his microphone, in the voice of Wolfman Jack. Curt smiles at having met one of his heroes, and exits the building.John is still at Burger City when Falfa comes up in his Chevy. John tells Falfa to meet him out at Paradise Road for their race. Terry pleads to go along, and John concedes.The word spreads throughout the strip, and soon reaches Steve's ears, who heads out there when word comes that Laurie is riding with Falfa.Meanwhile, Curt has returned to Burger City, and over to a nearby phone booth. On his car radio, he hears Wolfman Jack relay his dedication to the blonde in the T-Bird, and smiles as Wolfman calls Curt a good friend. Wolfman dedicates the next song to the blonde, and gives her the number of the phone booth at Burger City, encouraging the girl to call Curt.Meanwhile, John, Falfa, and a number of other kids have rolled out to Paradise Road. Once out there, John finally realizes that Laurie is riding with Falfa, and asks what she is doing in there. Laurie gives a nonchalant ""Mind your own business, John"" and stays in Falfa's car, but Terry gets out to shine his flashlight for the race. As the vehicles take off, the race stays tight, until Falfa loses control of his car, skids off the road, rolls, and crashes, whilst John continues straight down the road.Steve arrives just in time to see the aftermath, and rushes to the wreck, to see Falfa emerge and Laurie beating and hitting him. Steve pulls her off Falfa just as John pulls Falfa away from the car, just as it bursts into flames.In a moment of desperation, Laurie cries and pleads for Steve not to leave, to which Steve embraces and tells Laurie that he is not going to leave her.Terry explains to John how impressed he was with how John beat Falfa, but John confides to Terry that just before Falfa's car swerved off the road, he was beating him. Terry explains that John was just nervous, and that he'll never be beaten. John just backs up Terry's hero worship, and to calm him down, says that they'll take on all comers, as Terry yawns, muttering, ""Jesus, what a night.""Meanwhile, back at Burger City, the phone rings, and Curt answers it, ecstatic to be talking to the girl of his dreams. He inquires about her name, but she does not give it. When Curt asks to meet her, she explains that she'll be cruising the strip again that night, but Curt wants to meet her now. She then says goodbye as Curt struggles to speak more, and the line goes dead.Several hours later, Curt goes to the airport to get on the plane to head East, with his friends and family saying goodbye. Steve does not accompany him, and Curt boards the plane, taking off to a new adventure. As he glances out the window of the plane, he sees a white Thunderbird traveling along a stretch of road.As the plane banks off, the audience is treated to images of John, Terry, Steve, and Curt, along with where they ended up in life:-John Milner was killed by a drunk driver in December 1964.-Terry Fields was reported missing in action near An Loc in December 1965.-Steve Bolander is an insurance agent in Modesto, California.-Curt Henderson is a writer living in Canada."
Papillon,1973,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070511/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A French convict in the 1930s befriends a fellow criminal as the two of them begin serving their sentence in the South American penal colony on Devil's Island, which inspires the man to plot his escape. A semi-fictional account ofHenri Charrière's time in the penal system in French Guyana - some of it spent on infamous Devil's Island - is presented. It's the early 1930s. Charrière - nicknamed Papillon because of his butterfly tattoo - and Louis Dega are two among many who have been convicted in the French judicial system, they now being transferred to French Guyana where they will serve their time, never to return to France even if they are ever released. A safe-cracker by criminal profession, Papillon is serving a life sentence for murdering a pimp, a crime for which he adamantly states he was framed. Dega is a wealthy counterfeiter, who expects his well-to-do wife eventually to get him released. On Papillon's initiative, Papillon and Dega enter into a business arrangement: Papillon will provide protection for Dega, while Dega will finance Papillon's escape attempt. As Papillon and Degas' time together lasts longer than either expects, their burgeoning friendship ends up being an important factor altering their original plans, needed as they work with and against others who are trying to achieve their own goals, sometime conflicting with Papillon and Dega's.—Huggo Convicted as a murderer by the French court, safe-breakerHenri Charrière, alias Papillon because of the colourful butterfly tattoo adorning his chest, is left to rot in a penal colony somewhere in the heart of French Guiana. Sentenced to life imprisonment, before long,Henri Charrièrestrikes a mutually beneficial deal with fellow inmate, Louis Dega, France's most infamous counterfeiter, and starts planning their escape. Then again, plans often fail, and a lifetime of back-breaking prison labour, solitary confinement, and inhuman conditions await those who contemplate escape. But man is born free. And resilient, life-thirsty Papillon is determined to get away at all costs and live life to the fullest. However, what is the price of freedom?—Nick Riganas Based on the true story of Henri Charriere, also known as Papillon, which is French for 'butterfly' (the character even sports a large tattoo of a butterfly). A petty criminal, Papillon is wrongly convicted of murder and sentenced to life in a French penal colony in 'Guiane' (French Guiana, South America). Papillon is determined to escape but attempt after attempt meets with difficulty, resulting in eventual recapture. He continues his attempts to escape despite incarcerations in solitary confinement as punishment.—Reid Gagle The movie opens with an official explaining the facts of life to a group of prisoners. The scene switches to a French city where a large group of men are being paraded at gunpoint through a street crowded with onlookers, police and media. A wealthy woman waves forlornly to a man wearing glasses. They board a freighter and are put in cells in the ship's hold.The men begin to talk about the short bespectacled man, Dega, who is said to be a renowned counterfeiter, who may have a lot of concealed money. The prisoners begin their voyage and are shown in various daily routines. The blue-eyed man with a large butterfly tattoo, Papillon, has a knife, decides to befriend Dega and promises to protect him. Some men are seen to be getting ill and weak in the heat as the ship travels south. Papillon is tanned, fit, and confident looking. Two men attempt to assault Dega during the night. Papillon manages to fight them off but is placed in irons. Finally the ship arrives at its destination in French Guiana, the men see three small islands in the distance and mention they are high security prisons. One is the real-life but long abandoned Prison of St-Laurent-du-Maroni (Bagne de Saint-Laurent-du-Maroni), where some scenes were filmed.While lining up to disembark one prisoner, Julot, a ""two time loser"", asks for Papillon's shiv and cuts his own knee, he pretends to fall down the gangplank and he is carried off on a stretcher. A young man walks into the ocean and is summarily shot and killed. The prisoners are marched through a town of onlookers, assembled at the main camp, the Pénitencier, and told that if they try to escape they will get two years in solitary, a second attempt means five years solitary confinement, and a third attempt means the guillotine. They are issued red and white striped uniforms. In the barracks an older prisoner/trustee recognizes Dega and explains that an easy job is available for a price. A struggling prisoner is brought in front of the assembled camp and is guillotined. Papillon and Dega stick together, they have a medical exam and just before they are assigned to the easy work a senior guard says Dega's counterfeiting cost his family a lot of money and assigns them to a hard labor logging detail in the swamp.One day a crocodile attacks the group, Papillon and Dega are told to get it with their bare hands. They meet another prisoner, Clusiot, at lunch break who shares some quinine anti-malaria medicine. Next, the prisoners chase butterflies with nets. Dega catches a big blue one. Papillon approaches the butterfly buyer and asks for help to escape. Arrangements are made for two weeks later. Papillon tries to convince Dega to come also. Julot's corpse is brought in with his throat slit, Dega is sickened and causes a commotion, Papillon escapes. Dega gets new bifocal glasses. Papillon comes to the butterfly buyer's camp and is immediately taken at gunpoint, betrayed.He is taken to ""Reclusion"" and told the rules. He is placed in a small cell 5 paces wide and starts walking back and forth and do push ups. His food and water are passed in through a small hatch, despite the poor food he vows to eat all. One day he finds a piece of coconut in his water bucket and a note from Dega. Eventually the guards discover the extra food and try to find out from Papillon who arranged it for him. He refuses to talk and is placed on half-rations. Then his ceiling is covered and he is placed in almost complete darkness. Over time Papillon gets very weak and hallucinates, thinking back on a wasted life, later fantasizing about a triumphant return to France with Dega. He is near death and reduced to eating insects when suddenly he is released as his solitary period is ended. He is taken back to the main camp.Slowly regaining his strength he renews his friendship with Dega, who appreciates that Papillon never gave him up. In the hospital ward he notices a young prisoner, Maturette, who is molested by a trustee. Maturette admits he is homosexual and will help Papillon if he can come too. Papillon starts planning a new escape with the Maturette and Clusiot. A prisoner doctor says he can make suitable arrangements for a price. Dega refuses to go along but gives Papillon money and a map. During a band concert night the three try their escape, a guard is alerted and Clusiot is hurt. Papillon and Maturette get over the wall and encourage Dega to join them. Dega breaks his ankle when falling over the wall.The three escape into the jungle. They paid 3,000 francs to buy a boat but find the boat is useless. A trapper with strange facial tattoos shows them he killed two men who had been waiting for the three escapees. He helps them escape down the river to a leper colony. At the leper colony the leader tests Papillon by telling him to smoke his cigar. Papillon does so and the man says he has non-contagious leprosy. The lepers give the three escapees a boat and some money and the three sail off toward the Honduras.At sea they scavenge water and eat turtles, endure storms and heat. Dega's broken ankle gets worse, Maturette knows some medicine and tries to do first aid . Eventually they land on a sandy beach and are immediately confronted by a small group of Spanish-speaking soldiers. Dega lies there in the sand and the other two scatter. Papillon meets a Spanish prisoner and together they run off deeper into the jungle. The Spanish prisoner is impaled on a booby trap and Papillon is hit with a blowgun dart and falls into a river.He awakes in a village of primitive natives. They live in thatch huts on a beach, fish for pearls and a nubile young woman helps Papillon regain his strength. The chief has Papillon give him a butterfly tattoo like that of Papillon. One day he wakes up and the natives are all gone but have left him a small bag with some pearls. Somewhere he gets newer clothes and appears to be a regular European tourist. At a border crossing he tries to join a religious caravan, they let him join them to cross. At the church, Papillon declares to the Mother Superior he is an innocent man who never killed anyone and gives her his pearls in a show of good faith. Asleep on a clean bed, he is rousted awake and taken at gunpoint. The nun has betrayed him.Five years (or more) later, Papillon is released from ""Reclusion"" with white hair, looking very old. He meets a dying Maturette in the courtyard. He is taken to Devil's Island and assigned a cabin where he is told to fend for himself. He meets Dega, who is also on the island, and has a tidy cabin, carrot garden and a few pigs, but is a bit off, mentally. Papillon begins observing the waves and currents and begins planning another escape. He figures out that every seventh wave is big enough to carry a floating object out to sea. He fashions two large floats and seems to have Dega convinced to escape with him. When it is time to go Dega changes his mind. The two friends hug and Papillon jumps off a cliff into the ocean timing to meet the 7th wave. He is carried out to sea clinging to his float.A voice-over announces that Papillon made it to freedom and outlived the prison. The final scenes are of the abandoned prison overgrown by the jungle."

In order to save the village from being ruined and get King Richard back to reclaim his rightful place on the throne, Robin and Little John decide to take a stand against Prince John and the Sheriff of Nottingham.—dawsonpersi Told with animals for it's cast, the story tells of Robin Hood (a fox) and Little John (a brown bear), who rob from the rich to give to the poor.The beginning of the film has the two tricking Prince John (a lion), and Sir Hiss (a snake). John has usurped the true ruler, King Richard, whom Sir Hiss hypnotized into going off on a Crusade. Robin and Little John disguise themselves as fortune tellers, and make off with a number of items from John's royal carriage.Eventually, Prince John and Sir Hiss make it to Nottingham, wherein taxes are collected by the 'honorable' Sheriff of Nottingham (a wolf). After collecting funds from the local blacksmith (a dog), the Sheriff pays a visit to a windowed bunny and her family. Her eldest son Skippy has turned 7, and his present of a farthing is snatched away by the Sheriff for tax-reasons. As the Sheriff leaves, an old blind fox enters, and reveals to the family that he's Robin Hood. Robin then gives a bow and arrow, as well as his hat to Skippy, and the young rabbit's spirits are lifted by the generous gift.Skippy, his two sisters, and turtle friend go out to try the bow and arrow. Skippy's first shot sends the arrow into Prince John's castle. Skippy sneaks in to retrieve it, but finds himself face-to-face with Maid Marian (a fox), and Lady Cluck (a hen). Marian and her lady-in-waiting then invite the children in, where they discuss Marian's love for Robin Hood, and play a game, wherein Lady Cluck pretends to be Prince John.Meanwhile, in Sherwood Forest, Robin Hood and Little John are relaxing, when they are visited by Friar Tuck (a badger), who explains of an archery tournament held by Prince John, with the winner receiving a kiss from Maid Marian. Against Little John's cautions, Robin decides they should attend.Robin disguises himself as a long-legged stork, and Little John disguises himself as a Duke. Robin ends up winning the tournament, but is found out by Prince John, who used the tournament as a way to capture the rogue. Before Robin can be executed, Little John creates a diversion, and soon, the entire archery grounds become a free-for-all, before Robin, Little John, Maid Marian, and Lady Cluck are able to escape into Sherwood Forest.Later on that evening, in Sherwood Forest, a celebration is held, with a song mocking Prince John, as 'The Phony King of England.' The song is then echoed throughout Nottingham, and soon the Sheriff is singing it as well. Prince John, infuriated by this insubordination, increases the taxes to the point where the inability to pay taxes puts much of the townsfolk in jail. When the Sheriff ends up going to the church and taking funds from the Poor Box, Friar Tuck attacks the Sheriff, and is arrested as well.Prince John is still upset that he still has not captured Robin Hood, and decides to hang Friar Tuck, to lure Robin into rescuing the 'corpulent cleric.'Robin Hood and Little John manage to sneak into the castle, and along with rescuing all those in prison, manages to make off with all of Prince John's gold. Little John is able to get everyone out, except for Skippy's youngest sister. Robin Hood manages to get her out in time, but is trapped inside the castle. The Sheriff of Nottingham chases Robin with a flaming torch. During their fight, the torch ends up setting the castle aflame, before Robin plunges into the moat, evading the Sheriff's and Prince John's clutches.In the aftermath, King Richard finally returned from the Crusades, and has Prince John, Sir Hiss and the Sheriff put to work breaking rocks. At the same time, Robin Hood and Maid Marian are married, to the happy cheers of the townspeople of Nottingham."
Paper Moon,1973,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070510/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"During the Great Depression, a con man finds himself saddled with a young girl who may or may not be his daughter, and the two forge an unlikely partnership. Set in the midwest of the depression-era, Paper Moon follows Moses Pray and Addie Loggins - one a con artist, the other, the young girl who's the daughter of a woman who's just passed away. The pair meet when 'Mose' stops by the sparsely-attended funeral in Kansas of a woman he once knew (we never see her). In attendance, is the woman's young daughter, Addie, whom Moses agrees to transport to St Joseph, Mo -- for money, of course. Mose - an inveterate hustler, has been working ostensibly as a representative of the Kansas Bible Company - who picks his marks from the obits, and tries to sell - at exorbitant prices - the decedents' spouse the custom bible they'd previously ordered. Wise beyond her years, Addie picks up on Moses' grift, and very quickly, she and Mose become a team. Traveling from town to town, making money in every dishonest way imaginable, and looking for the ultimate score. The colorful characters they meet along the way make the film all the more interesting. One in particular - Miss Trixie Delight - an exotic dancer who Mose rescues from a traveling carnival and the girl who works for her, poor, suffering Imogene. Addie sees Miss Delight as a potential rival, and she concocts a plan with Imogene to free themselves of her. The film's peppered with regional dialogue, one of the most memorable line's uttered when Mose is forced to wrestle a backwoodsman in order to trade his new car for the hillbilly's battered old truck; ""make him say calf-rope, Leroy!"" one of the observers calls out. Paper Moon, directed by Peter Bogdonovich is adapted from the novel, ""Addie Pray"" (1971) by Joe David Brown.—MARK FLEETWOOD <mfleetwo@mail.coin.missouri.edu> Sometime during the Great Depression, Moses Pray is at the sparsely attended graveside funeral service in Gorham, Kansas for a woman he knew, he tasked, albeit reluctantly, with taking the deceased woman's nine year old daughter, Addie Loggins, to live with her only kin, her maternal Aunt Billie, in St. Joseph, Missouri, despite Moses and Addie not knowing each other. In private, Moses and Addie acknowledge that he could very well be her biological father. On the surface, Moses is a bible salesman for the Kansas Bible Company. However what Addie quickly learns is that Moses is a con artist, his primary penny ante scam being to scan the obituaries for recently deceased males, and approach the deceased man's family claiming that the deceased man had purchased a name engraved bible for a loved one (named in the obituary) so that Moses can collect the exorbitant fee for the bible, the loved one rarely refusing to pay as the bible is a final memory of the deceased. Out of circumstance, Moses is forced to keep Addie with him a bit longer than directly driving her to St. Joe, he in the process involving her in his cons, especially as he discovers that she may be more adept at it than he is. Their initially antagonistic relationship softens over time as they rake in more and more money, to the point that their general talk is that they will end up together truly as father and daughter. But a happily ever after could be threatened by a number of encounters, including with: Trixie Delight and Imogene, a young woman who Moses has a thing for, and her maid, with Trixie not being as much a lady as she would like to portray herself as being; and a number of targets of their cons who may take drastic action to show Moses they do not take too lightly to be swindled.—Huggo Kansas, 1930s. 9-year old Addie Loggins's mother has just died, leaving her alone (she never knew her father). Moses Pray is a con man and initially uses Addie's misfortune to make some money off a third party. With that done, he tries to pack her off on a train to her aunt in Missouri, but Addie won't have any of that. They set off for her aunt's place by car, with neither having much time for the other, initially.—grantss When Moze is unexpectedly saddled with getting the 9-year-old Addie to relatives in Missouri after the death of her mother, his attempt to dupe her out of her money backfires, and he's forced to take her on as a partner. Swindling their way through farm country, the pair is nearly done in by a burlesque dancer and an angry bootlegger.—Jwelch5742 It is the early 1930s, and a small funeral service is underway at the gravesite of Essie May Loggins. In attendance are two female acquaintances and Addie (Tatum O'Neal), the 9-year-old daughter of the deceased. Arriving late for the service is Moses Pray (Ryan O'Neal), a suave-looking younger man. It becomes clear that Essie May was a somewhat ""loose"" woman, and that Moses was one of her lovers. One of the women at the funeral says she notices a resemblance between Moses and Addie, and wonders if Moses is not the girl's father. Moses denies this, but the women persist in questioning him. When they find out that he is heading in the direction of Missouri, they convince Moses to deliver Addie to her aunt and uncle in St. Joseph. Moses is frustrated with this responsibility, but he sees an opportunity in it as well. Moses is a con man, and he uses his own knowledge of Essie May's affairs to blackmail a local man; he takes Addie in to briefly meet the man and then suggests that he may have fathered the child and that Moses could press the issue now that Essie May is dead. Instead of taking responsibility for the child, the man pays Moses $200 to keep quiet, and Moses uses the $200 to buy himself a new car, as well as a train ticket to St. Joseph for Addie. However, Addie is no innocent child. She overhears the conversation that Moses has with his victim, and she refuses to be used in a con game without any compensation: she demands the $200 that Moses acquired, arguing that it's rightfully her money. Moses is furious that Addie is sharp enough to figure out what was going on, and afraid that she might actually blow the whistle on him, he agrees to get her $200 back. After sending a telegram to Addie's relatives saying that she will be delayed, Moses takes Addie with him while he goes to make back her hush money.Addie learns that Moses' hustle is posing as a Bible salesman. He looks in the obituary section of the local newspaper, goes to the homes of men who have recently passed away, and informs their widows that their husbands ordered a Bible with the woman's name printed on the inside. While Moses is talking to a woman named Pearl, Addie finds material in the car with which he printed her name on the inside of the Bible. Touched that her deceased husband intended to buy her a gift, Pearl gives Moses the money for the Bible, and Moses' con is clear to Addie.Moze (as Addie refers to him) is annoyed with having to take Addie along with him on the road, and she reveals herself to be wise beyond her years at every turn. She carries a cigar box with her containing her only possessions in the world, other than her radio. Addie herself thinks that Moze is her father, and she reminds him of this several times, but he denies it consistently. Moze dislikes Addie being involved in his con, but he soon learns that she is an asset when he attempts to hustle a widowed woman into buying a Bible and suddenly a lawman appears in the house, questioning Moze about his business and his identity. Addie saves the day by rushing up to the house and charming the policeman, and she even ups the price of the Bible on the spur of the moment. In another instance, Addie takes pity on a woman who appears at her door surrounded by young children; Addie refuses to allow Moze to take the woman's money and leaves the Bible for her anyway. Moze is angry with Addie for interfering in his affairs, but Addie understands now that she is partners with Moze, and their con turns into profitable business. Moze also teaches Addie different con techniques, such as how to talk sales clerks out of money, and Addie's charm works well for them.Things take a different turn when Moze and Addie visit a traveling carnival and Moze acquires a girlfriend named Trixie Delight (Madeline Kahn). Trixie appears in the carnival as a 'harem girl', and there is a suggestion that she does a little more than just dance for the male patrons. Moze informs Addie that Trixie and her personal maid, Imogene (P.J. Johnson), will be traveling with them from now on, and Addie is furious to have their relationship interrupted by Trixie, who is a loud, obnoxious woman. Addie becomes sullen and ignores Trixie until she has a frank conversation with the girl; Trixie admits that she can never hold onto a man for very long, and that if Addie is patient, Moze will soon tire of her and she will move on.Addie seems to accept this proposition, until Trixie talks Moze into buying a very expensive new car; Addie looks in her cigar box and finds all of their money gone. This is the final straw for Addie, and she immediately plots Trixie's downfall. Enlisting the harried Imogene to help her, the two of them arrange for Trixie to be caught in a compromising position with the desk clerk of the hotel where they are staying. For her part in the scheme, Addie gives Imogene enough money to get back home to her family, and after Moze catches Trixie in bed with the clerk, he immediately collects Addie and abandons Trixie.From here, Addie and Moze seize another opportunity: while staying at a small hotel in a rural area, Addie notices a bootlegger conducting business quietly. His customers approach him and he retrieves their liquor from a small shed in back of the hotel. Addie and Moze get the idea to climb into the shed and steal some of the liquor, then sell it back to the bootlegger. Although their scheme works, they do not know that they have been found out by a man lurking in the shadows nearby. As they leave the hotel in their car, they are pursued by a sheriff who takes them into custody. While at the sheriff's station, Moze and Addie are questioned relentlessly. Although he knows what they did, he cannot prove anything--Addie has hidden the telltale cash they made in her hat. The sheriff intends to keep Addie and Moze locked up until he can pin something on them, so Addie spontaneously comes up with a plan; she steals back the keys to their car and urges Moze to make a break for it. Together they rush outside and make a quick getaway. Pursued by the sheriff and his men, they manage to make it across the border into Missouri, where the sheriff has no jurisdiction and cannot arrest them. Realizing that their car will make them conspicuous, Moze spots a dilapidated old truck outside a farm and rouses the inhabitants of the shabby farmhouse. Making up a reason, he informs them that he needs to swap vehicles and that he will give them the brand new car in an even trade for their broken down truck. The men refuse to trade, saying that the new car is no use to them since it cannot haul anything, so Moze offers to wrestle for it. The men can't resist the challenge and send their best 'wrassler', Leroy (Randy Quaid), to take on Moze. Moze quickly takes the match, however, by playing dirty, and he 'wins' the right to drive off in the beat-up truck.Now that the two of them are in Missouri, the issue comes up about Addie's original destination: her aunt & uncle's house. Moze instead suggests that this is no longer necessary; they will conduct business as usual, as they are partners. Both of them are happy with this decision, as they don't really want to be separated.Moze quickly sets up an opportunity for a very big score involving a wealthy gentleman, and he tells Addie that this will net them enough money to finally get out of the con business. Moze sets out to meet their mark, with Addie to follow later, but he is intercepted by the sheriff from Kansas and his men; while they cannot arrest Moze for his crime in Kansas, they are only interested in revenge, and they chase Moze down and beat him severely. Addie knows something is wrong when Moze is nowhere to be found, and she finds him beaten and bloodied, lying in a stairwell.Now that violence has found him, Moze has a change of heart about having Addie along in this lifestyle; he will take her to live with her aunt and uncle after all. Addie promises that she will not cry about separating from Moze, but when he drops her off at the house, she is less than enthused about living there. Addie's aunt (Rose-Mary Rumbley), is a flighty woman who treats Addie like the child she is, and Addie is put off by her cloying and overly cheerful attitude.Meanwhile, Moze has set off up the road in the broken down truck, which stalls out and leaves him sitting there. He is down on his luck, but even more, he is heartbroken about Addie leaving. Suddenly he looks up into his rear view mirror and sees her, off in the distance, running toward the truck. Although he is glad to see her, he puts on a stern face and stares her down, telling her ""I told you, I don't want you riding with me no more."" Addie is hurt at first, but then she stares back at him and says ""You still owe me $200."" Moze is flustered, and the truck begins to drift away while he isn't looking. Addie shrieks in warning, and they both run after it. Together they climb inside and drive off to a new destination."
Serpico,1973,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070666/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"An honest New York cop namedFrank Serpicoblows the whistle on rampant corruption in the force only to have his comrades turn against him. Serpico is a cop in the 1960s-early 1970s. Unlike all his colleagues, he refuses a share of the money that the cops routinely extort from local criminals. Nobody wants to work with Serpico, and he's in constant danger of being placed in life threatening positions by his ""partners"". Nothing seems to get done even when he goes to the highest of authorities. Despite the dangers he finds himself in, he still refuses to 'go with the flow', in the hope that one day the truth will be known.—Rob Hartill In 1960s New York City, idealistic Italian descendant Frank Serpico joins the New York Police Department and on his first day, he learns that his colleagues are dirty, sharing money received from the extortion of criminals. Serpico refuses to receive the money and reports to a superior. Along the years, his superior does not take any attitude against the corruption and Serpico is an outcast police officer, rejected by his fellows. Further, his personal life is affected and he is harassed and threatened by his colleagues. In 1971, in a drug bust, Serpico is betrayed and shot in the face. He recovers with minor consequences and testifies to the Knapp Commission about the police corruption. Finally, Switzerland gives him political asylum and he moves to that country.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Frank Serpico is an inexperienced young cop who starts out on patrol. Later, he starts to work as an undercover cop who busts all sorts of criminals, but mostly drug dealers and pushers. Since Serpico is a young man living in the 1960s and early 1970s, he lives as one. His image, based on how others see him, shows him as just a 'hippie' and the criminals he busts have no idea he is really an undercover officer. Everything is working out well, except the money situation. Serpico refuses to accept money like the other officers do. He feels this isn't right, and wants to expose the situation. Who he thought were his friends now turn into his enemies when Serpico takes the stand on a grand jury investigation. He continues to work undercover, and his life is placed into jeopardy at the hands of his colleagues.—Anonymous Biopic of the New York City detective whose anti-corruption efforts in the 1960s and early 1970s led to the creation of the Knapp Commission and the uncovering of widespread corruption of police officials at all levels. All his life, Frank Serpico had wanted to be a policeman. However, he learns at an early stage in his career that even the cop on the beat is somewhat corrupt, accepting free meals and the like. As he advances in his career he finds that corruption is rampant, particularly in the Plainclothes Division, where they collect more in graft that they do in salary. His refusal to take any money puts him in bad stead with his colleagues to the point that his life could be in danger. Transferred to the Narcotics Squad, he is shot by a drug dealer when his partners fail to support him. Serpico resigned from the NYPD in 1972.—garykmcd Frank Serpico (Al Pacino) covered in blood and slumped in the backseat of a police car as it races to a hospital with lights and sirens blaring. He has just been shot in the face. The rest of the movie tells the story of Serpico's career up to this moment, starting with him becoming a police officer in 1960. He is very idealistic and believes in non-brutal methods to catch criminals. Serpico also refuses to join in on police corruption, specifically that which involves shaking down and taking payoffs from gambling and drug dealing organizations. His refusal to take bribes earns him the suspicion of his fellow officers throughout the majority of the precincts to which he is assigned. Additionally, Serpico finds trouble fitting in due to his embrace of the counterculture of the 1960s: He moves to Greenwich Village, grows his hair and beard long to the point where he must maintain a plainclothes appearance, and associates with a more left-wing crowd that is distrusting of the NYPD.At first Serpico tries appealing to his bosses about the corruption, but gets nowhere. He enlists a highly-connected fellow officer, Bob Blair (Tony Roberts) in his fight against corruption, but not even he can crack the city administration's general indifference. His campaign and the resulting complications and harassment within the department take a toll on his mental health and his relationship with fiancee Laurie (Barbara Eda-Young), who ultimately leaves him. After meeting a sympathetic police inspector who agrees to assist him with both disrupting the gambling rackets and later calling attention to the problem by going to the New York Times, he is transferred to narcotics, as he has always wanted. However, he finds himself in an even more corrupt and hostile atmosphere than before, where he has mostly enemies and almost no allies due to the reputation he has garnered. As a result, he is shot in the face during a raid on a heroin lab due to his fellow officers' reluctance to come to his aid. After being left for dead and eventually discovered by two uniformed officers, the story takes over from the beginning and shows a recuperating Serpico being tended to by his family and few remaining friends as well as being anonymously harassed with hate mail.At the end of the film, Serpico testifies to the Knapp Commission on police corruption. The film ends with him waiting to board a ship; despite being promoted to detective (a lifelong ambition of his) and being decorated by the department for ""conspicuous bravery in action"" (along with the two officers who abandoned him during the drug raid) he resigns from the NYPD and emigrates to Switzerland."
Enter the Dragon,1973,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070034/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A Shaolin martial artist travels to an island fortress to spy on an opium lord - who is also a former monk from his temple - under the guise of attending a fighting tournament. Enter the Dragon revolves around 3 main characters; Lee, a man recruited by an agency to investigate a tournament hosted by Han, since they believe he has an Opium trade there. Roper and Williams are former army buddies since Vietnam and they enter the tournament due to different problems that they have. It's a deadly tournament they will enter on an island.—Emphinix Lee is recruited by a secretive intelligence group to infiltrate an island owned by the master criminal Han who appears publicly only at a martial arts tournament he hosts every three years. Han learned his martial arts skills at the same monastery as Lee, who has been invited to tournament as well. When Lee learns that it was Han's men who were responsible for his sister's death, he sets out for revenge as well. Other participants in the tournament include Americans Roper and Williams who were in the army together. They all soon realize that Han uses the tournament to recruit new associates - and those who refuse are killed.—garykmcd Bruce Lee plays a martial-arts expert determined to help capture the narcotics dealer whose gang was responsible for the death of his sister. Lee enters a kung fu competition in an attempt to fight his way to the dealer's headquarters with the help of some friends. Lee, a martial arts instructor, is approached by British Intelligence and is persuaded to attend a martial arts tournament on a private island owned by Han, a crime lord. Lee's assignment is to gather evidence that will prove Han's involvement in drug trafficking and prostitution.—Fella_shibby@yahoo.com In Hong Kong, a Mr Braithwaite attends a sparring match of martial artists. Among them is a man named Lee who fights an opponent considerably larger than him. Lee himself is exceptionally skilled, forcing his opponent (Sammo Kam-Bo Hung) to yield. At the end of the match, several of the monks present raise their hands creating an obstacle that Mr Lee flips himself over easily, earning their applause.
Braithwaite meets later with Lee. Before Lee talks to Braithwaite, he gives a short lesson in harmony and control to a young male student of his, teaching the boy not to attack with anger or exposition. Lee also teaches the boy how to bow properly to earn the respect of an opponent. Braithwaite reveals his purpose for the meeting: Lee has received an invitation to a large martial arts tournament on a private island run by a reclusive man named Han. Han is suspected of doing business in prostitution and heroin, however no solid evidence can be found linking Han to any nefarious dealings. Braithwaite wants Lee to attend the tournament and act as a spy. Lee is slightly reluctant, having not wanted to attend the tournament, however he agrees.Before Lee leaves for Han's island, he visits the Old Man of his Shaolin temple, who tells Lee about the day his sister was killed. Many of Han's thugs had come to the mainland and had attacked Su Lin. Though she skillfully and bravely fought them off, she was cornered in an old warehouse. Rather than be beaten and raped, she killed herself with a shard of glass. One of the men who led the attack, Oharra, Han's right-hand man, witnesses her suicide. The Old Man bids Lee to obtain revenge not only for his sister but for the honor of Shaolin.Around the time that Lee is ready to board Han's sampan, two other men arrive. Roper, a fancy playboy of sorts, who totes a lot of baggage, has come to the Orient to hide out from the mob, to whom he owes money. In his last meeting with some mob thugs, Roper fought his way out of having his leg broken to repay his debt. The second man is Williams, a black man who was harassed and attacked by the police right after meeting with his sensei in the United States. When he was a attacked, Williams fought back, besting the two cops and escaping in their cruiser.On the boat to Han's island, Lee and Roper both bet on a praying mantis match. Roper favors the larger of the two insects while Lee favors the smaller. Lee wins a handful of cash on the match. While Lee takes in the breeze from the harbor, an aggressive invitee named Parsons tries to antagonize him after tripping a boy carrying a load of fruit. He asks Lee about his fighting style; Lee answers it is ""the art of fighting without fighting"". Parsons scoffs, trying draw Lee into a match. Lee suggests that they take a small dinghy to a nearby island and match on the beach. When Parsons eagerly climbs down to the boat, Lee releases it from the sampan and lets it drift out behind, holding onto the rope and ordering Parsons not to pull himself in or he'll set him adrift on the ocean. Lee then hands the rope to the crewmembers, who are greatly amused.On the island, the passengers see hundreds of other martial artists practicing on giant courts. That night, everyone attends a lavish feast. Han arrives, bidding welcome to his guests, praising them for their skill and thanking them for attending. He has several women with him who act as his elite personal guard. He tosses several pieces of fruit in the air while the women hit them with small darts, thrown with pinpoint accuracy. Lee catches one of them. After dinner, Han's hostess, Tania, brings young women to Roper and Williams -- Roper requests to spend the night with Tania herself. The woman Williams is with warns him not to step outside his room when Williams wants to get some fresh air.When Tania visits Lee, he requests the young woman who threw the dart in the apple he'd caught at the banquet.
Lee meets with the dart thrower, Mei Ling, who is actually a spy sent by Braithwaite prior to recruiting Lee. She tells him that she's found out very little about Han's illegal activities except that many young women who come to the island disappear. Lee later sneaks out of his room. Evading Han's guards, he finds a hidden trapdoor that leads to several underground chambers where Han has been cooking heroin. He subdues a few of Han's guards and is forced to retreat when the possibility of being discovered becomes too great. As he sneaks back to his room, Williams spots Lee climbing a nearby wall.The next morning, Han attends the 1st few rounds of his tournament. He finds that Roper and Williams fight exceptionally well. Roper lays a few bets on Williams that pay off and has Williams lay down more bets. The two win a substantial amount of cash. Han appears and announces that one of his guests had been outside of their room after curfew and that some of his guards were attacked. He has his greatest fighter, Bolo, kill them all as punishment. Han later sends a message to Williams to meet him in his quarters. Roper is suspicious and tells Williams to watch his back.In his meeting with his host, Williams is praised by Han for his abilities, though they are unorthodox. Han mentions that Williams fights more for glory than harmony but Williams shrugs off Han's opinion, saying he fights to look good. Han then accuses him of attacking his guards the previous night. Williams is immediately angered, demanding that he be allowed to leave the island. Han refuses and a couple of his thugs attack Williams, who defeats them easily. Han himself takes up a combat stance and the two fight around the close quarters of Han's office. When Williams tries to kick Han in the hand, he inexplicably injures his foot. Han takes advantage and finally beats Williams down, killing him with a single blow. He removes the glove from his left hand, revealing that it's made of solid bronze.Back at the tournament, Roper beats a few opponents. Lee is called up to fight Oharra, one of Han's champions. With the memory of his dead sister to guide him, Lee lands several lightning-fast hits on Oharra. Oharra suddenly grabs one of Lee's feet with Han barking at him to let Lee go. Lee counterattacks with a vicious backflip kick to Oharra's chin that knocks him back. To finish him, Lee delivers a ferocious kick to Oharra's chest, knocking him into a few chairs and some of the spectators. Enraged, Oharra grabs two bottles, breaking them and brandishing the necks as weapons. Lee knocks the bottles from Oharra's hands and kicks him to the ground. Lee then lands a fatal blow to Oharra's throat. Han is flustered, telling the crowd that he has been disgraced by his champion and he leaves the court silently.Han later meets with Roper, showing him his extravagant home. One room is filled with glass display cases and Eastern weapons. In one case are the bones of a human hand. Han cheerfully says the severed hand is a ""souvenir"". He takes Roper into a room with a guillotine, placing own cat under the blade. He tells Roper that real loyalty is being able to kill at request but Roper refuses to pull the release rope that would kill the cat. Han pulls the rope, which activates a platform that lowers them into the lower levels of Han's house. Down there Roper sees Han's heroin lab and the prostitutes and prisoners he holds. Most of the women have vacant looks, as if drugged. Han makes Roper a generous offer to join his operation but Roper refuses when Han shows him the body of Williams, hanging over a deep pool. Roper is visibly upset at the sight of his dead friend and Han has the body dropped into the pool. Roper is taken prisoner.Needing to investigate further and to find a radio to get a message out to Braithwaite, Lee infiltrates the lower level again that night, picking up a cobra placed at the trapdoor to scare off any snoopers. Lee finds his way to the radio room, using the cobra to force the radio operators out. He gets his message out by telegraph. When he's discovered by Han's guards, he battles them, beating them with his fighting ability and their own weapons. After dispatching the last group, he rushes into another chamber but is trapped by closing metal doors. Above him, Han tells him that his fight with his guards was ""extraordinary"" and that he was planning to recruit him. Lee, however, has no desire and allows himself to be taken prisoner.The next morning on the tournament courts, Han orders Lee and Roper to be pitted against each other but they both refuse to fight. Han menacingly says he'll find opponents for them to fight, starting with pitting Bolo against Roper. Bolo carries the fight to his advantage for a few minutes until Roper battles back and lands a hard kick to Bolo's crotch, taking all the fight out of him. Infuriated, Han orders his men to attack both Roper and Lee. They find themselves easily defeated. Lee moves on Han, who takes off his fake fist and replaces it with a clawed appendage. Lee battles him, receiving a few slashes but is able to disarm Han when the drug lord has his claw stuck on a table. Meanwhile, Mei Ling frees all of Han's prisoners, directing them out to the tournament courts where they engage Han's men.Han runs off to his house with Lee right behind. In his trophy room, he takes an attachment for his wrist comprised of several sharp blades. The two square off - Han is able to slash Lee several times and wields a spear from his arsenal, however Lee is able to beat him back, forcing him to retreat behind a hidden door his spear becomes stuck in.

Jesus Christ Superstar,1973,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070239/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Film version of the musical stage play, presenting the last few weeks of Christ's life told in an anachronistic manner. Based on a concept album project written by Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice, and the subsequent long-running Broadway performance, this film tells the story of the final 6 days in the life of Jesus Christ through the troubled eyes of Judas Iscariot. Too often mis-labeled a musical, this film is a ""rock opera."" There are no spoken lines, everything is sung.—Ralf Southard <rps8@psu.edu> The camera pans across a landscape of desert hills dotted with stone ruins (""Overture""). A plume of dust in the distance resolves into a red and white bus that stops and disgorges a troupe of actors. The actors unpack costumes and props, including a large wooden cross. They dance aroundTed Neeley, who will play Jesus, and dress him in a white robe. The actors, some still dancing, deploy themselves around the ruins of what might have been a temple.As Jesus talks with a group of followers, Judas (Carl Anderson) watches from a distance and worries (""Heaven on their Minds""). He's afraid that Jesus is beginning to believe what people are saying about him -- that he's God. He's also afraid that Jesus' followers will turn on him when they find that he isn't God, and that the Romans who occupy Judea will come down on them if they perceive Jesus' growing following as a threat to their rule.In the cave where Jesus and his followers are staying, the apostles ask when they're going to Jerusalem (""What's the Buzz?""). Jesus puts them off (""Don't you try to think ahead / Save tomorrow for tomorrow / Think about today instead""). Mary Magdalene (Yvonne Elliman), seeing that Jesus is hot and tired, tries to soothe him by bathing his face with cool water, which Jesus appreciates (""She alone has tried to give me / What I need right here and now""). Judas steps in to say he thinks it strange ""that a man like you / Can waste his time / On women of her kind."" Jesus responds angrily (""Who are you to criticize her?"") (""Strange Thing Mystifying"").Caiaphas (Bob Bingham) the high priest discusses Jesus with his associate Annas (Kurt Yahjian). Like Judas, Caiaphas believes that Jesus' popularity will bring down the wrath of the Romans. He mentions talk of crowning Jesus king. They agree to take the matter to the priests' council (""Then We Are Decided"").Back at the cave, Mary sings to Jesus to relax him (""Everything's Alright"") and rubs ointment on his head and feet. Judas interrupts to scold Mary for wasting money on expensive ointment when it could have been used to help the poor. Jesus points out that they can't help everyone (""Surely you're not saying / We have the resources / To save the poor from their lot? / There will be poor always, / Pathetically struggling. / Look at the good things you've got!"") He adds that he'll soon be gone, a warning that no one but Judas seems to notice.In council, Caiaphas tells the other priests that Jesus is a danger to the nation, concluding ""Like John [the Baptist] before him / This Jesus must die"" (""This Jesus Must Die"").Jesus is carried into Jerusalem by cheering, palm-waving crowds (""Hosanna""). Caiaphas advises Jesus to disperse the mob because they're too loud. ""Nothing can be done to stop the shouting,"" Jesus replies joyfully; ""If every tongue was stilled the noise would still continue / The rocks and stones themselves would start to sing.""Later, in a big dance number, followers led by Simon Zealotes (Larry Marshall) tell Jesus how much they love him; at first he smiles at the crowd and laps it up. Simon urges Jesus to ""Keep them yelling their devotion / But add a touch of hate at Rome"" ... ""You'll get the power and the glory / Forever and ever and ever"" (""Simon Zealotes""). Jesus loses his smile while Judas looks on anxiously; this is the sort of thing Judas most fears. Some Roman soldiers march up and stop to watch, but Simon and his crowd are too wrapped up in their hero worship to notice. In a somber mood, Jesus tells the people -- and Mary, who kneels at his feet -- that none of them understand power and glory, and ""To conquer death / You only have to die"" (""Poor Jerusalem""). Simon is deeply puzzled.Pontius Pilate (Barry Dennen), a Roman official, sings of a dream in which he met ""a Galilean, a most amazing man. / He had that look you very rarely find, / The haunting, hunted kind."" Pilate foresees that he'll be blamed for the death of the Galilean in his dream (""Pilate's Dream"").Jesus visits the temple, which is like a modern-day flea market with modern-day merchandise (postcards, hand grenades) -- plus money lenders, of course. And prostitutes. Becoming angry (""My temple should be a house of prayer / But you have made it a den of thieves!""), Jesus runs around dumping tables and knocking over stalls (""The Temple""). Judas, again, watches in dismay. The vendors and customers flee. Jesus walks off into the hills, perhaps to calm down, but is accosted among the rocks by a crowd of the blind, halt, and sick, who beg to be healed. At first he reaches out to them, but he's unable to help them all and the mob seems to swallow him. He finally screams ""leave me alone!""Meeting Jesus as he walks back to their camp, Mary wraps him in a tattered blanket and sings to him as he lies down under a tent (""Everything's Alright (Reprise)""). As he sleeps, she muses about her love for Jesus, which confuses and frightens her (""I Don't Know How to Love Him""). ""I'm the one / Who's always been / So calm, so cool / No lover's fool ... I never thought I'd come to this.""Judas seems to be agonizing over something; he squats in an empty landscape, letting sand run through his fingers. When a row of Roman tanks appears over the crest of the hill and bears down on him, he runs to the temple. He's there to betray Jesus, but tries first to explain his motives to the uninterested priests (""Damned for All Time/Blood Money""). All they want to know is where the soldiers can find Jesus at a time when he's not surrounded by crowds. Caiaphas offers Judas a fee (""We'll pay you in silver / Cash on the nail""), which Judas turns down (""I don't want your blood money"") until Caiaphas points out that Judas can give the money to the poor -- he knows exactly which buttons to press. Judas takes the bag of money and says that Jesus will be in the Garden of Gethsemane on Thursday night.In the Garden of Gethsemane, the apostles are feeling mellow (""Look at all my trials and tribulations / Sinking in a gentle pool of wine"") and Jesus is feeling sorry for himself -- not without reason, given what he seems to know is about to happen to him. ""For all you care, this wine could be my blood,"" he says. (His petulance is a brilliant way to explain the rather odd, cannibalistic ideas behind the Eucharist.) He goes on to predict that ""one of you here dining"" will soon betray Jesus and another will deny knowing him. Judas exchanges some bitter words with Jesus before going off to bring the soldiers. The remaining apostles fall asleep and Jesus asks, ""will no one wait with me? Peter? John? James?"" (""The Last Supper"").Jesus goes for a walk to commune with God (""Gethsemane (I Only Want to Say)""). He asks whether he has to go through with his death, and asks to know the reason for it (""You're far too keen on where and how / But not so hot on why""). If God replies, it's not evident.Judas comes back with soldiers and identifies Jesus for them with his famous betraying kiss. Peter and the other apostles wake up and offer to defend Jesus (""Hang on lord, we're gonna fight for you""), but Jesus tells them ""it's all over"" and to ""stick to fishing from now on"" (""The Arrest""). The soldiers march Jesus back to the city, attracting a crowd as they go. Curious bystanders and journalists question him as he walks (""Do you think that you may retire? / Did you think you would get much higher? / How do you view your coming trial?""). Jesus doesn't answer. The soldiers take Jesus to Caiaphas, who asks if he's really the son of God. Jesus doesn't deny it, only replying ""that's what you say."" The crowd demands, ""take him to Pilate!""Peter, Mary, and another disciple stop at a camp along the road for water. A woman, a soldier, and an old man all recognize Peter (""you were with that man they took away""), but each time Peter claims not to know Jesus (""Peter's Denial""). Mary says sadly, ""It's what he told us you would do. / I wonder how he knew.""Jesus is frog-marched into the presence of Pilate, who makes fun of him, asks him if he's really king of the Jews, and dismisses his case to Herod (""Pilate and Christ""). King Herod (Josh Mostel), surrounded by wildly costumed, dancing courtiers, twits Christ in his turn. In ""King Herod's Song (Try It and See)"", he offers to let Jesus go if he'll perform a miracle. (""Prove to me that you're divine -- / Change my water into wine!"") When Jesus fails to respond, Herod declares him a fraud and sends him away.Mary Magdalen and Peter, standing on a stark mountainside overlooking the desert, wish for things to go back to the way they were before Jesus was arrested (""Could We Start Again, Please?""). They're backed by a crowd of followers. Jesus (who isn't really there, of course) turns and walks off into the desert.Soldiers throw Jesus into a pit, where Judas peers down at him until he's pushed away by a guard. Judas goes back to the priests to complain about how badly Christ has been treated, saying he'd save him the suffering if he could. Annas and Caiaphas tell Judas that events have unfolded just as he predicted, and ""What you have done / Will be the saving of Israel."" Judas isn't comforted and continues, in a song that includes a brief reprise of ""I Don't Know how to Love Him,"" to berate himself for the betrayal. Overcome with remorse, Judas hangs himself from a tree (""Judas' Death"").Jesus is taken back to Pilate, where the priests ask that Jesus be sentenced to death (""We need him crucified / It's all you have to do""). Pilate resists, saying Christ has committed no crime worthy of death and asking Jesus to defend himself. The crowd gets so agitated that Pilate agrees to flog Jesus (""Trial Before Pilate (Including the 39 Lashes)""). But it's not enough. Faced with an incipient riot and Jesus' insistence that nothing Pilate can do will prevent his death, a frustrated Pilate says ""die if you want to, you misguided martyr!"" and washes his hands.In another fantasy sequence, Judas descends from a star (lowered by a visible crane) to speak to Jesus, who is alone in the amphitheater where the trial was held. Judas points out that Jesus could have spread his message more easily if he'd come today (""Israel in 4 BC had no mass communication""). He asks Jesus why he chose ""such a backward time / And such a strange land?"" (""Superstar."")On a hilltop where two men have already been crucified, soldiers are pounding nails into something on the ground. They raise a cross on which Jesus is hanging, crowned with thorns. They jeer, but Jesus asks God to forgive them. A few of Jesus' followers, including a grief-stricken Mary, watch from below. The soldiers raise a ladder and nail a board to the cross above Jesus' head. It's just possible to make out the letters INRI on the board; they stand for Iesus Nazarenus, Rex Iudaeorum -- Jesus of Nazareth, king of the Jews. Jesus asks, ""my God, my God, why have you forgotten me?"", and says ""Father, into your hands I commend my spirit."" He dies.As the film ends, the performers, out of costume, reboard their bus. Last come Yvonne Elliman (Mary) and Carl Anderson (Judas); there's no sign of Jesus. Ted Neeley stripped away his costume and disappeared into the cast beforehand. The bus drives off. The final shot shows the empty cross against a setting sun, as a shepherd and his flock cross the hillside (""John 19:41"")."
The Three Musketeers,1973,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0072281/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A young swordsman comes to Paris and faces villains, romance, adventure and intrigue with three Musketeer friends. France, 17th century. A young man, d'Artagan, sets out for Paris with the aim of joining the elite Musketeers. There he first antagonises then befriends the three greatest Musketeers - Athos, Porthos and Aramis. He is also drawn into a plot by the scheming Cardinal Richelieu to undermine the Queen of France and the English Duke of Buckingham.—grantss The young D'Artagnan (Michael York) arrives in Paris with dreams of becoming a King's Musketeer. He meets and quarrels with three men, Athos (Oliver Reed), Porthos (Frank Finlay), and Aramis (Richard Chamberlain), each of whom challenges him to a duel. D'Artagnan finds out they are Musketeers and is invited to join them in their efforts to oppose Cardinal Richelieu (Charlton Heston), who wishes to increase his already considerable power over King Louis XIII (Jean-Pierre Cassel). D'Artagnan must also juggle affairs with the charming Constance Bonancieux (Raquel Welch) and the passionate Lady De Winter (Faye Dunaway), a secret agent for the Cardinal.—Eric Sorensen <Eric_Sorensen@fc.mcps.k12.md.us> D'Artagnan (Michael York) and his father (Joss Ackland) engage in an exhausting sparring duel. The father shows his son a signature move, which ends with the point of the sword at his son's chest, and advises to use it in a fight only as a last resort. He gives the boy 15 crowns and a letter to the commander of the King's musketeers, then presents him a sword he and his own father used in the King's service. The young Gascon leaves home on a huge yellow workhorse with his few belongings and a salve his mother advises him to rub into any wounds, and he strikes out for Paris to take his place as a musketeer.As D'Artagnan arrives in Paris he comes upon Rochefort (Christopher Lee), a tall man with a patch over one eye, who makes an offhanded remark to some companions about the newcomer's horse. Anxious to fight at any opportunity, as his father suggested, the young Gascon challenges Rochefort, only to have his sword struck in two. He is knocked out as his new enemy goes to meet an approaching carriage. Rochefort greets the passenger inside--Milady DeWinter (Faye Dunaway)-- and tells her she must go to England to report on the Duke of Buckingham (Simon Ward). The pair are spies for Cardinal Richelieu (Charlton Heston). D'Artagnan again tries to pick a fight but ends up falling in the mud.Finding the musketeers' headquarters, D'Artagnan awaits an appointment with their commander M. Treville (Georges Wilson). As he makes his way through the indoor training ground, he sees Porthos (Frank Finlay) having his portrait done while Aramis (Richard Chamberlain) watches; outside Treville's office, Athos (Oliver Reed) has a shoulder wound attended to. Treville reads D'Artagnan's letter and asks to see the familiar sword, which D'Artagnan sheepishly produces; the commander knows the weapon, realizes what has happened and lets him borrow a new one. Unfortunately there is no place in the musketeers for him, Treville says, until he has established his reputation on campaign or in killing, but a place in the guard might be suited to him in the meantime. Suddenly D'Artagnan spots Rochefort outside and leaps from the window. . .only to be hoisted back up as he lands on a scaffold. Excusing himself to Treville, he hastily runs from the office and collides with Athos and his wounded shoulder. The musketeer says D'Artagnan needs a lesson in manners, and they agree to duel at the Carmelite Convent at 12:00. Hurrying downstairs to catch up with Rochefort, the Gascon knocks Porthos down, causing a wardrobe malfunction which embarrasses him, so they agree to duel at the Luxembourg at 1:00. Once outside, D'Artagnan mistakenly compromises a lady trying to get Aramis' attention, so the musketeer and intended priest decides to have the young man meet him at 2:00 to settle the matter with swords.At the convent, it turns out that D'Artagnan's other two appointments are with Athos' dueling seconds. Before the duel can begin, however, six of the Cardinal's guards appear and prepare to charge at the musketeers for dueling, which is against the law. D'Artagnan joins the outnumbered threesome, noting that he may not have a tunic, but has the heart of a musketeer. Together they make short order of the guards, and Athos has an opportunity to see that the Gascon is a good swordsman. The remaining two guards surrender, but not before Porthos finds that his hat has been cleaved in two and lifts twenty pistoles from a downed guard to pay the damages (and twenty more to teach them manners). Later Athos explains that the musketeer motto is ""one for all, all for one,"" so each of them gets ten pistoles from the booty, which Athos suggests D'Artagnan use to get lodgings and a servant. He chooses Planchet (Roy Kinnear) for a servant, and takes dingy lodgings at two francs a day with the elderly M. Bonacieux (Spike Milligan) and his wife Constance (Raquel Welch), a clumsy but beautiful younger woman and the dressmaker to Queen Anne of Austria (Geraldine Chaplin).Porthos bets and loses all of their money, so the group enter a tavern; Porthos makes it a point to annoy Aramis and they start to duel, but when D'Artagnan tries to quell the swordplay, Athos pulls him back. The men are creating a distraction while they rustle some much-needed food and drink. D'Artagnan and Planchet soon get into the spirit, passing the pilfered food to Athos, who hides it under his cloak. When they depart, Athos throws a purse to the barkeep, which he secretly filled with salt, they make their escape and fill their bellies with the hard-won food.At the palace, the Cardinal arrives, and locals are paid to wave flags and cheer his coming, as he is despised by many for manipulating the power of the King (Jean-Pierre Cassel) to his own advantage. The King discusses the musketeers' fight with Richelieu's ""ruffians,"" and is worried because the Duke of Buckingham has arrived in France and covets his wife Anne, but Richelieu assures him that she is faithful; in secret he has a plot he is about to set in motion.At night Rochefort and his men break into M. Bonacieux's home while he is in bed with Constance, and prepare to take the couple to the Bastille, but Constance fumbles her way free and returns home and into D'Artagnan's arms. Later she leaves, saying she has to stop somewhere before she continues to the palace and the Queen, and makes him promise not to follow her, but he worries about her safety and trails after her from a distance to discover her meeting with another man. He challenges the interloper, then finds out it is the Duke of Buckingham himself. He helps escort the Duke and Constance to the palace laundry where Buckingham meets with Anne and begs her for a token he can hold until they can be together for good. She gives him a necklace containing twelve diamond studs. Suddenly guards appear and the Duke is outnumbered and in danger of being discovered, but D'Artagnan assists and Planchet brings the other musketeers as well, and they defeat the guards while the Duke makes his escape.At the Bastille, the Cardinal meets with Bonacieux and accuses him of treachery, then upbraids Rochefort for failing to hold onto Constance; Rochefort tells the Cardinal that Anne has given the diamond studs to Buckingham. The Cardinal releases Bonacieux, befriending him with a gift of 100 pistoles to get him to spy on his own wife. At an outing, the Cardinal mentions to the King that he wants to see the queen dance, and they plan a ball in her honor in two weeks' time. Richelieu suggests to the King that she should wear the diamond studs, and he approaches Anne with the request. The Cardinal later gives him a box with two diamond studs inside, and prompts him to count the studs when Anne wears the necklace and question her if they are all not there. He has sent Milady DeWinter to England and, in a tryst with Buckingham while he is wearing the token of Anne's affection, Milady has stolen the two studs the Cardinal has given the King. For the Queen to appear without them will cause her dishonor and may well cost Anne her life.Desperate to get the studs back, the Queen writes a letter to Buckingham and gives it to Constance, who is prepared to entrust it to her husband, but when he mentions that the Cardinal ""took my hand and called me friend,"" she refuses to reveal more, so Bonacieux goes out to fetch Rochefort. D'Artagnan has been listening unseen, and volunteers to take the letter as he loves her and knows how to get to England. He locates the purse of 100 pistoles to use for the trip, but the pair are forced to quickly hide in a wardrobe when Bonacieux arrives with Rochefort and his men; after no trace of the pair is found, they leave. Constance faints and the wardrobe crashes to the ground. D'Artagnan breaks out of the wooden wardrobe, angered by the continued interference of the ""inconvenient"" Rochefort. Athos later tells the Gascon to avoid the man as he is a dangerous swordsman for the Cardinal. The trio of musketeers agree to help D'Artagnan get the letter to Buckingham and ride out with the agreement that if one falls, the others continue on their way.At a tavern Porthos gets into an argument with a man and, as they duel it out, the others ride on. The man slices into the musketeer's outfit, drawing blood, and Porthos drops to the ground. Later Athos and Aramis are set upon by thieves; Aramis is held at gunpoint, and D'Artagnan and Planchet watch from a distance, shocked, as Athos is cut at the throat in a duel. They continue to the docks to board a ship for England, but have no pass. Rochefort has a signed pass to board, but needs the governor to countersign, so he takes the road to town. On Rochefort's return, D'Artagnan accosts him, and when they recognize each other they fight a rough duel in the dark. Rochefort is wounded by D'Artagnan but not killed, and the Gascon suffers scraped ribs. Planchet nabs the pass, and when the harbor master questions why there are two people with one pass, D'Artagnan notes that he is one person, and Planchet is a servant.An exhausted D'Artagnan arrives in England, having taken six days. Buckingham is ready to hand over the studs but suddenly realizes that two studs are missing and figures out that Milady took them. His jeweler O'Reilly (Frank Finlay) is able to perfectly reproduce the two studs, and Buckingham hands the packet over to D'Artagnan, asking how he can repay him. D'Artagnan notes that they are enemies, but Buckingham offers a handshake and a sword which he accepts. With Planchet at his heels, they manage to get to Paris before the ball starts. At the familiar location of one of his companions' duels, D'Artagnan jumps upon a fresh horse, cutting a rope attached to the pommel, not knowing that two of his fellow musketeers are using the horse to pull Athos out of a well he has fallen into. The musketeers are wounded but recuperating. They realize from the accident with the horse that D'Artagnan has returned successfully and head out to join him at the ball.The Queen arrives on the arm of the King, but she is wearing a pearl necklace and he demands she wear the diamond studs; stalling for time, she says she will send to the palace for them and departs to wait with her dressmaker in hope of being saved. When Constance looks out a balcony window, she upsets a pot of flowers and D'Artagnan immediately knows from the accident where to go; he creates a distraction with musicians and prematurely set-off fireworks, but is delayed in getting the studs to Constance when the guards appear. The musketeers soon arrive and with the help of Planchet, who infiltrated the ball in a polar bear costume, they manage to subdue the guards. D'Artagnan throws the packet with the studs up to Constance, but they are thrown into the wrong window. Milady picks it up, but Constance bursts in and the two women fight until D'Artagnan swings in to assist. Constance is able to nab the valuable packet.The Queen reappears at the ball and reveals the studs at her neck. After the King tries unsuccessfully to count them while dancing with his wife, he stops the music and reveals the box containing the two studs which the Cardinal had given him; she delightedly says she now has fourteen studs. Backpedaling, the Cardinal says he wanted to give the additional studs to her but could not bring himself to do so directly. Milady informs the Cardinal that D'Artagnan thwarted the plot, but the Cardinal says the game continues.At an elaborate ceremony, Treville announces that D'Artagnan has become a musketeer; his comrades put the tunic over his shoulders while the commander provides his musket. The Queen greets him and, when she offers her hand, she discreetly gives him a ring as thanks for saving her honor. Milady flirtatiously passes by the new musketeer as D'Artagnan, joined by Constance and his friends, head to new adventures, and they become the Four Musketeers."

It is the early 60s in France. The remaining survivors of the aborted French Foreign Legion have made repeated attempts to kill DeGaulle. The result is that he is the most closely guarded man in the world. As a desperate act, they hire The Jackal, the code name for a hired killer who agrees to kill French President De Gaulle for half a million dollars. We watch his preparations which are so thorough we wonder how he could possibly fail even as we watch the French police attempt to pick up his trail. The situation is historically accurate.

After several failed attempts and the trial and execution of several of their leaders, the OAS hire an assassin in a final attempt to complete the task. He is The Jackal.—grantss A British assassin is employed by disgruntled French generals to kill Charles de Gaulle while a dedicated gendarme follows the assassin's trail in this political thriller. The film uses the perspectives of the ultra-professional assassin as he prepares his work and that of the harried but humble French detective as he undercovers the plot.—Keith Loh <loh@sfu.ca> When President De Gaulle decides to grant independence to French Algeria, several of the soldiers, who fought in that campaign, feel that De Gaulle is belittling the lives of the men who died there. So they form a group and make attempts at De Gaulle and fail. When several of their key members are killed or caught and eventually executed, the three top members decide to hire a professional assassin to take out De Gaulle. The man that they chose agrees to do it on the condition that he be alllowed complete autonomy. He also advises them to go into hiding until the job is done. And they do. When the French Security force learns that they have shut themselves off from the rest of world are curious what they are doing. So they abduct their errand boy, and once interrogated all he says is the assassin's code name, ""The Jackal"", they hypothesize that they have hired an assassin to go after DE Gaulle. Once De Gaulle is informed he refuses to alter his plans and will not allow extra security added. So his ministry decides that they should find the Jackal before he makes his move. They appoint the best detective in France, Claude Lebel to find him. Lebel plan is to contact every police department in the world and see if the Jackal comes from their country and if so to provide him with a description and/or a photo. Now Scotland Yard has a small lead but unfortunately they miss him but they have his passport so assuming that he is out of the country, they try and find the passport that he is using. Now when they think that they have him, he discards the identity that he is using and assumes another one. Can they find him before he gets De Gaulle?—rcs0411@yahoo.com In August of 1962, France is in a state of turmoil. President Charles de Gaulle had granted the country of Algeria independence, a decision that has enraged many French citizens. Many of them, mostly fanatics and extremists from the army, have formed an underground organization called the Organisation de l'armée secrète, and one faction, headed by Jean-Marie Bastien-Thiery, decide to assassinate de Gaulle. They set up shop along a road that de Gaulle's motorcade will be taking to the airport, and, as the motorcade passes, open fire on the Presidential car with automatic rifles. A number of bullets shatter and enter the vehicle, but not a single of them make a mark on de Gaulle or anyone else inside. Six months later, Bastien-Thiery and the other conspirators in the plot are captured. Bastien-Thiery's lawyer makes a stay of execution, but it is turned down, and the next morning, Bastien-Thiery is executed by firing squad.The top members of the OAS, Colonel Marc Rodin, manager Casson and treasurer Montclair take stock from hiding at a remote chalet in Austria, and realize that they cannot make any move as they will constantly be watched and identified: the OAS is planted with snitches who will watch every members move, and each member has had their complete details archived. Rodin realizes that what they need is a foreigner, someone whom no one in France has seen and has no record.Three months later, Rodin has succeeded in finding the right individual, an Englishman with a short but impeccable record. He invites him to Vienna for an interview by the three OAS leaders. The Englishman is smart, enigmatic and cold-blooded; he figures out their need for an outsider to assassinate de Gaulle, given the failed prior attempts and the OAS being riddled with informants. He accepts the job, but warns that he'll have to be paid $500,000 for the work, as anyone who does something like this will never be able to work again. He demands utmost secrecy and anonymity, and asks that no one but the four of them know of this project and that he work completely by himself. He takes the codename ""the Jackal"", and takes his leave of the OAS heads; his farewell is observed by Rodins bodyguard and adjutant Victor Wolenski.The Jackal begins his preparations: he researches extensively on his target, he acquires two false passports, he pays a visit to Paris to acquire a good shooting location, and he contacts two individuals in Belgium. The first is an armorer whom he commissions to build a special rifle; the second is a forger from whom he requires special French documents.Later on, the Jackal receives an OAS contact named Valmy that will inform him of any developments regarding the President. Around the same time, the OAS sends a female agent named Denise to bed a high-ranking French politician. Two weeks after visiting the armorer and forger, he returns to acquire his purchases. He is satisfied with the gun the armorer has made, and a trial of the rifle goes well; the forger on the other hand tries to blackmail him over his papers, and the Jackal snaps his neck.All his plans complete, he leaves for France under the name of Paul Oliver Duggan.Meanwhile, to raise money to pay the Jackal, the OAS heads order their network to rob a bunch of banks across Paris. The tactics range from late night burglaries to daylight ambushes of armored cars. This sudden crime wave is noticed by the French Action Service (the French espionage branch), and although several of the robbers are captured, they are hired thugs who only know that they've been ordered to carry out these robberies on behalf of the OAS.The Action Service's suspicions grow when they learn that Rodin and his associates have suddenly secluded themselves in the Hotel Garibaldi, in Rome, which is owned by an OAS sympathizer. From research by surveillance teams in the area, they observe that Rodin and co. are untouchable. They live alone on the top floor of the hotel, and the floor below that is occupied by their eight bodyguards, highlighting the mens' fear of being kidnapped. So far, their only form of contact with the outside world is Wolenski, who makes twice-daily trips to the post office to send and receive letters. After five weeks, the Action Service decide they need Wolenski taken in for questioning. They abduct him off the street while he's walking to the post office to pick up mail, load him into the back of a truck and drive him to an airfield, where he's then flown to Paris in a small propeller plane. They interrogate and torture him to death, but all they get is that a blond killer named Jackal visited his superiors. This is enough for the chief of the Action Service to conclude that the OAS are employing an outside contract killer as part of a plot to assassinate De Gaulle.The French Interior Minister asks for an interview with De Gaulle, but his demand for secrecy is rebuffed; de Gaulle is a proud man who refuses to go into hiding or shield himself. The Interior Minister instead convenes a secret council to deal with the Jackal, which includes high-ranking individuals like Police Commissioner Berthier and Colonel St-Clair. Berthier states that because of the Jackal's anonymity from even his own employers, no one has a clue where to start looking for him; the key to finding and stopping the Jackal thus is to establish his identity. He recommends his own deputy commissioner, Claude Lebel, as the best detective in France and ideal for the job of uncovering the Jackal.Lebel, a mild-mannered but tenacious policeman, is summoned to the council. He is given access to every resource available, but he is asked to keep things secret, and that he succeeds. Lebel brings in his assistant Caron to help him out, and the two get to work contacting the heads of police agencies abroad. Meanwhile, St-Clair arrives home and pours out everything about the situation to his mistress, Denise. She later slips off and phones Valmy...Over in London, enquiries are being headed by Inspector Thomas, who has been given express authority by the Prime Minister to make full investigations regarding the Jackal (ensuring that he not be English, or if he is to be stopped). The British police come up with two things that they pass over to Lebel. Firstly, that there was a suspicious character named Charles Calthrop who was in the Dominican Republic around the time its dictator Trujillo was assassinated (Jackal in French is ""chacal"", the word formed from the first three letters of each name); a search on Calthrop's home reveals he is absent. Second and more worryingly, a review of all passport applications reveals that one was made for one Paul Oliver Duggan, who had died at the age of two.Meanwhile, the Jackal learns from Valmy that his assignment is blown, but decides to continue on regardless. He makes it to a hotel at Grasse, where he spends the night charming and seducing a fellow guest, Baroness Collette de Montpellier.The next morning the hotel records are taken and scanned, as is French customs (and more urgently than usual). Presently Duggan's name is spotted and immediately Lebel orders forces on the hotel and he heads over there himself. They find no sign of the Jackal, him having already left the hotel (something Lebel finds strange), but they learn that the Baroness's bed had been slept in by two people. Lebel interviews the Baroness, but she denies knowing a thing about the man.The Jackal's quick getaway before the police arrive is cut short by accidentally crashing his car. He decides to head for the Baroness's estate, where she takes him in. That night she tells him the police were looking for him, but promises she wont say anything if he tells her what hes about; in response, he strangles her. He takes on a new disguise and identity of bespectacled Danish pastor Per Lundqvist, whose passport he stole earlier in Heathrow Airport, and quickly but quietly leaves. He heads to Tulle station in the Baroness's car and catches a train to Paris. Hours later, the servants discover the Baroness's body.Lebel reports the failure of catching the Jackal and the murder of Madame de Montpellier, and notes that he could not have escaped unless he had been forewarned and that he now has the identity of a Danish pastor (having traced the car to the station and questioned the station authorities). He also notes that the murder means he can do away with secrecy and initiate a public manhunt. A police squad heads to Paris station to intercept the Jackal, but they arrive a few minutes too late. Lebel sends police to check every hotel in Paris, but the Jackal evades them by entering a Turkish bathhouse and being picked up by a French homosexual.Lebel uses a phone tap to discern that Denise is the OAS spy that's been tipping off the Jackal. He presents a recording of her phone call to the council, and St-Clair leaves (he later overdoses on sleeping pills); he'd tapped all the phones of the council members, having had suspicions about the Jackal being forewarned. Afterwards, he works out that the Jackal will strike in two days, or August 25, 1963 which is Liberation Day, the anniversary of France's liberation from Nazi Germany. De Gaulle, as a World War II veteran, is sure to make a public appearance on that day no matter what the threat, and the council disbands, intending to make all attempts to find the Jackal before then.Meanwhile, the Jackal kills the homosexual when he sees a public broadcast about Per Lundqvist being wanted for murder.In the early hours of Liberation Day, the Minister wearily informs Lebel that they've been unable to find the Jackal. All they can do is implement the utmost security precautions around. The day goes on, but nothing happens. Some time later, a gendarme allows the Jackal, disguised as an old one-legged French war veteran, to head to his residential address, after seeing his papers; the Jackal enters his location, sheds his disguise and disassembles his crutch to form his rifle, and waits for the President to present medals to former French Resistance members.Lebel strolls around looking for anything the least suspicious or out of place, but he doesn't find anything until he meets the gendarme around the time the President presents medals. He learns that the officer let a cripple with a crutch through, sees that the address pointed out has a window open on the top floor, and rushes over there, ordering the officer to follow him.The Jackal aims, takes his shot... and misses because De Gaulle suddenly bends his head to kiss a Resistance soldier on the cheeks, as is French custom. The Jackal reloads his gun for a second shot, but then Lebel and the gendarme burst in on him. He guns down the gendarme, but Lebel snatches up the officers submachine gun and empties it into the Jackal.Over in London, Charles Calthrop appears at his flat. The British authorities take him in for questioning, but conclude that he had nothing at all to do with the Jackal and close the matter (also forswearing any responsibility regarding the Jackal, since he was an Englishman but also a Dane and a Frenchman). Thomas ponders who the Jackal really was...The film ends with a funeral in Paris: a body is buried in an unmarked grave, with Lebel the only witness."
Westworld,1973,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070909/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A robot malfunction creates havoc and terror for unsuspecting vacationers at a futuristic, adult-themed amusement park. An amusement park for rich vacationers, it provides its customers a way to live out their fantasies through the use of robots that provide anything they want. Two of the vacationers choose a wild west adventure. However, after a computer breakdown, they find that they are now being stalked by a rogue robot gunslinger.—K. Rose <rcs@texas.net> In a near future, the Delos Company offers the vacation of the future in in the amusement parks Medievalworld, Romanworld and Westworld for U$ 1,000 per day. The vacationers get to experience life in the themed period, doing whatever he or she wants, interacting with the robot inhabitants that populate the parks. Peter Martin and John Blane travel by hovercraft to Westworld and soon Peter duels against a Gunslinger. However, when there is a malfunctioning of the machinery, the robots get out of control, jeopardizing the guests.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil It's sometime in the near future. Delos is an amusement park for the wealthy, where guests, for $1,000 a day, can live out their wildest fantasies in one of three resorts: Medieval World (recreating thirteenth century Europe), Roman World (recreating the height of the Roman Empire) or Westworld (recreating the 1880s Wild West). While the guests take on whatever role he or she wants, the resort-supplied ""actors"" filling in that world are all robots designed to be realistic to the actual beings, they programmed to fulfill the pleasures of the guest, whether that be as a friend, very good friend, or foe, with guests guaranteed that ""nothing can go wrong"" in that no harm can come to themselves, anyone else or the robots, on which routine servicing is conducted to rise again to fulfill the same or different role. Escaping the realities of a divorce, Peter Martin is a first time guest at Westworld with his friend, John Blane, a second time visitor who tries to reassure novice Peter. Slow to embrace the game and role playing aspect of the park, Peter eventually receives the rush he so desired when he ""kills"" a dark clad adversary at a saloon, that dark clad figure who he discovers is assigned his enemy in encountering him again. During Peter and John's stay, the technicians find that some robot malfunctions are occurring, the effects to the guests minor in nature, with John the victim of one of the more serious offenses. However, those minor incidents turn into major ones where the robots begin to malfunction to the point of taking control, with the dark clad gunslinger, equipped with some of the more high tech sensory mechanisms, after Peter to duel to the death.—Huggo Peter Martin and John Blane decide to take a holiday in a high tech amusement park, Westworld. Here they get to play cowboys - saloon brawls, saloon girls and quick draws against the town's gunslinger - with lifelike robots. All is well for the first few days but when the park's central computer malfunctions, the built-in safety features are turned off and the robots begin to attack the guests. The gunslinger in particular seems indestructible and relentlessly pursues his prey.—garykmcd It is sometime in the near future, in a fictional high-tech adult amusement park called Delos. The park is divided into three zones: WesternWorld, MedievalWorld and RomanWorld. The entertainment in all three areas consists primarily of interaction by the guests with androids programmed to act in character (the Old West, medieval Europe, and pre-Christian Rome, respectively). The androids are indistinguishable from human beings, apart from minor flaws in their hands, and guests are encouraged to indulge in any fantasy, including killing the androids. The androids are programmed to respond positively to guest requests, specifically including requests for sex. Delos's guests pay $1,000 a day for the experience.Peter Martin (Benjamin) a first-timer and his friend John Blane (Brolin), who has visited previously, come to the WesternWorld zone, where one of the main attractions is the Gunslinger (Yul Brynner), a robot programmed to start duels. Thanks to its programming, humans can always outdraw the Gunslinger and kill it. The guns issued to the guests also have temperature sensors that prevent them from firing at each other or anything else living but allow them to 'kill' the room-temperature androids.Gradually, the technicians running Delos begin to notice problems with the androids. In what may be the first mention of the concept of a computer virus in a film, the technical staff describe inexplicable problems and breakdowns spreading ""like a disease"" between the machines, first in one area of the park and then on to the others. First, the robots in MedievalWorld begin suffering an inexplicable number of systemic failures. Then, a robot rattlesnake strikes Blane. Against her programming, a female servant android refuses a guest's request for sex. The failures increase until the robotic Black Knight kills a guest in a sword-fight in MedievalWorld. The resort's supervisors, in increasing desperation, attempt to regain control by shutting down power to the entire park. Unfortunately, this results in trapping them in the control rooms, unable to turn the power back on again while the robots run amok on stored power.Martin and Blane, who have been passed out drunk after a bar fight in the WesternWorld bordello, wake up unaware that there has been a change for the worse. The two men are confronted by the Gunslinger, who challenges them to a showdown. Blane treats the confrontation like a joke, until the robot shoots and kills him. Martin runs for his life as the robot implacably follows him.Martin flees to the other areas of the park, but finds only a panicky fleeing technician, dead guests and damaged robots. He manages to open a manhole leading to the underground control area, where the resort's technicians have suffocated since the ventilation shut down. The Gunslinger stalks Martin through the corridors, arriving at the robot repair facility where Martin lies in wait, pretending to be a disabled robot. Martin ambushes the Gunslinger by throwing a beaker of hydrochloric acid, found among the repair materials, into its face. Thinking he has disabled the Gunslinger, he leaves the service area and enters MedievalWorld.However, Martin is again followed by the Gunslinger, whose face has melted but who is still functioning, though its visible spectrum optics were destroyed by the acid. The robot can still see Martin, but only via infrared backups, and is confused when he moves in front of several flaming torches, something it would not have been programmed to deal with in WesternWorld. The Gunslinger begins to leave the room, but Martin accidentally makes a noise, allowing the Gunslinger to zero in on him again. When it lunges to strike, its ammunition exhausted, Martin seizes the opportunity to set fire to it with a large torch.Thinking this has destroyed the robot, Martin leaves the burning Gunslinger and wanders out of the great hall, finding what he believes to be a female guest chained up in the dungeon. He releases her and gives her a drink of water, whereupon her face bursts into sparks, revealing she is a machine. Backing away in shock, he is confronted by the still moving burned hulk of the Gunslinger, which continues its attempt to attack him. However, it falls off a high set of steps in the process and, finally succumbing to damage, shuts down. Martin, apparently the sole survivor of the humans at Delos, simply sits down on the dungeon steps in a state of near-exhaustion and shock, thinking of the irony of Delos's advertising, ""Have we got a vacation for you!"""
High Plains Drifter,1973,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068699/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A gun-fighting stranger comes to the small settlement of Lago and is hired to bring the townsfolk together in an attempt to hold off three outlaws who are on their way. A Stranger (Clint Eastwood) rides into in the dusty mining town of Lago, where the townspeople are living in the shadow of a dark secret. After a shoot-out leaves the town's hired-gun protectors dead, the town's leaders petition the Stranger to stay and protect them from three ruthless outlaws who are soon to be released from prison. The three have their sights set on returning to Lago to wreak havoc and take care of some unfinished business. A series of events soon has the townspeople questioning whether siding with the Stranger was a wise idea, as they quickly learn the price that they each must pay for his services. As the outlaws make their way back into Lago, they discover that the town is not exactly as they had left it, and waiting in the shadows is the Stranger, ready to expose the town's secret and serve up his own brand of justice.—bob-oconnor1964 The sleepy Wild West mining town of Lago, named after a local lake, is shaken up when a tough stranger (Clint Eastwood) stands up to the local gun champions and kills them in an uneven duel. The locals are impressed, enough to vote in town council to let Sheriff Sam Shaw (Walter Barnes) explain those were hired guns overstepping their task. But the three worst the town ever saw, which they were hired to check, are being released from jail. The Stranger accepts seemingly reluctantly, to be put in charge of order and mounting a defense, recruiting the factotum dwarf as his Deputy. Instead of doing their dirty work, he abuses his ""blank pay check"" not just for free goods, but also to commandeer everyone in a militia and transform the whole town. The jail-freed trio realizes too late that he's after vengeance for the whip-torment they inflicted on weakling Marshal Jim Duncan (Buddy Van Horn) years ago, still the stranger's daily nightmare.—KGF Vissers A stranger (Clint Eastwood) rides out of the hot desert into a small town in the wild west. The townspeople are scared of him, and three gunmen try, unsuccessfully, to kill him. He takes a room and decides to stay. Meanwhile, a group of outlaws are about to return to the town and take their revenge. Will the town's leaders convince the mysterious man to help?—Colin Tinto <cst@imdb.com> A mysterious gunfighter without a name (Clint Eastwood) rides across the desert landscape and arrives in the mining town beside the sea ""Lago"" to stay for the night. After gunning down three desperado's who tried to kill him, the town hires the gunfighter to help defend the town from three murderous outlaws. Stacey Bridges (Geoffrey Lewis), Bill Borders (Scott Walker), and Cole Carlin (Anthony James), who have been released from jail after they brutally whipped to death the town's local lawman Marshal Jim Duncan (Buddy Van Horn) who is in his grave with an unmarked gravestone, set out to return to ""Lago"" to get their vengeance. Can the mysterious gunfighter without a name stop the three outlaws?—Daniel Williamson A distant figure on horseback rides through shimmering, midday heat. He's nearer now, a bearded man in a dark cowboy hat and long dusty overcoat--the Stranger (Clint Eastwood).The Stranger enters the tiny western town of Lago and rides slowly down the main street. The townspeople stop and watch him pass. Freighter Jake Ross (John Quade) cracks a bullwhip to wake his team of horses. The Stranger, startled, snaps his head around at the source before riding on.The Stranger leaves his horse at the livery stable and walks to the saloon. On the front porch three armed, tough-looking men watch him enter: Bill Borders (Scott Walker), Tommy Morris (James Gosa), and Fred Short (Russ McCubbin). The Stranger exchanges looks with Borders and enters the saloon.From the end of the bar farthest from some locals, he orders a ""beer and a bottle"" from saloon keeper Lutie Naylor (Paul Brinegar). The three men who were on the porch enter and take positions around him. Borders says, ""Flea-bitten range bums don't usually stop in Lago. Life here's a little too quick for 'em. Maybe you think you're fast enough to keep up with us, huh?"" Everyone freezes, waiting for the Stranger's reaction. He suddenly reaches for the whiskey bottle, scattering the local town folk, and causing the three tough men to tense. As he leaves, he whispers, ""I'm faster than you'll ever live to be,""He walks across the street to the barber shop, whiskey bottle in hand, and pays for a shave and a hot bath. He hangs his overcoat and gun belt on a coat rack. The barber (William O'Connell) seats him, drapes him with a smock, and nervously applies shaving cream to his face. The three toughs enter and resume taunting him. The Stranger ignores them, irritating Borders, who suddenly spins the chair. The Stranger shoots Borders in the forehead with a gun hidden under the smock. He then shoots Morris and Short before they can react.He stands and removes the shaving cream with the smock. He puts on his gun belt, replacing a wooden gun stock in the holster with his smoking gun. He steps outside, where the stunned townspeople are creeping over to view the carnage. A dwarf, Mordecai (Billy Curtis), gives him a cigar and offers a light, asking, ""What did you say your name was, again?"" The Stranger replies, ""I didn't.""The Stranger walks toward the stable. Callie Travers (Mariana Hill), a young woman of unknown background, purposefully collides with him. The shoulder of her sleeve is ripped, and she berates him for it. He tells her there's no reason to make a fuss, that she could have asked if she wanted to get acquainted. She angrily insults and repeatedly provokes him. He tries to leave, but she grabs him and insults him again. He returns her insults. She tells him he has ""the manners of a goat"" and slaps the cigar from his mouth. Pushed too far, he tells her, ""You're the one that could use a lesson in manners,"" and drags her, screaming, into the stable. He throws her onto the loose hay and rapes her.The Stranger walks back past the barber shop where townsmen remove the dead bodies left by the stranger and clean up the barbers shop. They stop and watch him pass. He enters ""Belding's Hotel"" and finds the owner, Lewis Belding (Ted Hartley), at the desk. The Stranger says, ""Room."" Belding gives him a key, reminding him to sign the register. The stranger merely looks at him and goes upstairs to his room. In the room, he wedges a chair under the doorknob, takes a gulp of whiskey, and lays down to sleep.In a dream, a bloodied man (Buddy Van Horn) lays in the same position as the sleeping Stranger. The man who is wearing a badge is being whipped in the street by three men. It is dark, but the silhouettes of those watching are clearly the townspeople. The three men whipping him are not shown. The bloody man asks the townspeople for help, but receives none. As he passes out, he says, ""Damn you all to hell."" The stranger wakes from the dream.The next morning, the Stranger wakes and goes to the barber shop. He asks for his bath which the barber, instantly nervous, orders Mordecai to prepare in the back room. The trembling barber nicks the man he is shaving, Sheriff Sam Shaw (Walter Barnes), shoos him away. Sam waits until the Stranger has settled into his bath, then asks if he can sit down to talk. Trapped, the Stranger reluctantly gestures that Sam may join him. Sam says that Borders was not a loved man and there will be no charges filed.Callie Travers, who The Stranger had raped in the stable, enters the tub room with a revolver, says ""You dirty bastard!,"" and shoots at the Stranger, who slides under the water. Sam wrestles her for the gun and, as he drags her out, instructs Mordecai to tell the Stranger not to leave town until Sam talks to him. After they're gone, the Stranger comes up for air and says, ""I wonder why it took her so long to get mad."" Mordecai, who witnessed the rape, responds, ""Because maybe you didn't go back for more.""In a backroom of the mining office, the prominent men in town are meeting: Mayor Hobart (Stefan Gierasch) of the general store, Dave Drake (Mitchell Ryan) and Morgan Allen (Jack Ging) of the mining company, the undertaker (Richard Bull), the gunsmith (Reed Cruikshanks), hotelier Belding, saloonkeeper Naylor, freighter Ross, and the preacher (Robert Donner). They have learned that Stacey Bridges and his cousins, the Carlin brothers, are to be released from prison that day. These three have sworn to burn the town to the ground. The group was counting on the mining company's hired gunfighters--Borders, Morris, and Short--to defend the town, but The Stranger killed them. Now, they are considering hiring the Stranger. Belding and the preacher don't like it, but the rest are in favor.The meeting is interrupted by Sam entering with still angry Callie in tow. Sam tells them about Callie's shooting outburst. Morgan Allen, her lover, tells her to be patient. Callie says, ""Isn't forcible rape in broad daylight a misdemeanor in this town?"" Allen tells her they need to avoid hysterics. She refers to hysterics not too long ago and spits on him, loudly questioning the manhood of the townsmen.Sam finds the Stranger eating at the hotel and tries to persuade him to defend the town. He says Bridges and the Carlins were troubleshooters for the mining company who were bullying townspeople before being convicted of stealing gold from the mining office. The Stranger suggests they were railroaded, and Sam admits that's why they are mad at the town. The Stranger says Sam can handle it. Sam replies, ""I'm no law man"", adding that his predecessor, Marshal Jim Duncan, was whipped to death in the street by outsiders. More pleading, then Sam says, ""This is a God-fearing town. These are God-fearing people."" The Stranger replies, ""You like 'em. You save 'em."" Desperate, Sam says, ""Look, what if we offered you anything you want?"" The Stranger stops in his tracks, turns, and asks, ""Anything?""In Hobart's store, the mayor and Sam explain that the Stranger ""has a free hand in this town,"" that he can have anything he wants in the town, ""even if it's a squaw or a Mex to keep your bed warm at night,"" and that, as far as preparing the ambush, everyone is ready to follow his orders. The Stranger pockets a handful of cigars. He gives two Indian children each a jar of candy and gives a stack of blankets to an old Indian man Hobart has just scolded for touching the merchandise. On the way out, he encounters Sarah Belding (Verna Bloom), Lewis's wife, who served his meal earlier and caught his eye. He repeats, ""Anything I want.""The Stranger visits the boot maker (John Hillerman) and takes many items, for which Sam says there is ""no charge."" He does the same at the leather maker (Jack Kosslyn's) shop. A number of townsmen follow him, carrying his booty. He leads them to the saloon where he orders a round on the house for everyone who's following him. When Naylor complains, Sam delights in saying ""Everyone's got to put something in the kitty."" Hearing this, The Stranger removes Sam's badge and pins it on Mordecai. Mayor Hobart snickers. The Stranger removes Hobart's hat and puts it on Mordecai's head, making him both sheriff and mayor. Mordecai is thrilled.At the gunsmith shop, Mordecai selects a huge revolver since he ""can't be sheriff without a gun."" The Stranger informs the townsmen they are now part of the ""City of Lago Volunteers"", tells the gunsmith to give each man a rifle, and orders everyone to report to the street for drills.At the territorial prison, Stacey Bridges (Geoffrey Lewis), Dan Carlin (Dan Vadis), and Cole Carlin (Anthony James) are released, and their gun belts returned. The jailer claims their horses were used for food, so they face a long walk. Dan says, ""Drake and Allen don't seem to have remembered."" Stacey replies, ""One way or another, they'll remember.""In Lago, the ""volunteer"" townsmen take shooting positions on the roofs of the taller buildings, while the Stranger watches from a central walkway. Sam and Mordecai gallop through town on Ross's wagon, pulling a trailer loaded with three stuffed dummies on saw horses. The townsmen rain gunfire on the dummies, but score no hits. The Stranger mutters, ""Shit.""Ross approaches the Stranger from behind, holding a knife, and says, ""I don't remember lending my wagons to be shot up."" Without looking back, the Stranger says, ""You're gonna look pretty silly with that knife sticking up your ass."" He draws and fires four shots, beheading each dummy and knocking off Mordecai's hat. He holsters his gun and says, ""You still here?"" Ross replies, ""No, I was just going."" Sam and Mordecai are excited about the shooting display, Sam saying, ""This is going to be a picnic."" The Stranger tells them to keep the men practicing.The Stranger asks two Mexican laborers to use lumber from Belding's barn to build picnic tables. When Naylor, who overheard, questions the picnic, he's told he is furnishing the beer and whiskey. Belding arrives. The Stranger overrules his objection to his barn being torn down, and tells him to provide 35 bedsheets for the picnic. Mordecai, the Stranger's new sidekick, says they also need someone to provide a barbecued steer and 200 gallons of red paint. Finally, the Stranger orders Belding to get everyone out of his hotel. Flabbergasted, Belding asks where his live-ins are supposed to go. The Stranger replies, ""Out.""Bridges and the Carlins come across three men camping. They shoot them and steal their horses and clothes. Now, instead of walking, they are riding at full gallop.At the mining office, Allen and Belding suggest to Drake that hiring the Stranger was a mistake. They argue that convicts always threaten revenge but rarely carry through, and complain that the Stranger's crazy orders have the townspeople turning on one another. Drake wants to wait a few days to be sure. The discussion is heated, and reveals that the townspeople, in addition to Bridges and the Carlins, had a hand in Marshal Duncan's death, or as Drake puts it, ""One hang, we all hang."" Drake refuses to budge and Allen storms out.At the hotel, the evicted guests are leaving, and Belding and the preacher are outraged. The preacher complains to the Stranger but gets nowhere. Sarah reports the readiness of the Stranger's connecting rooms, ""The best in the hotel. One for entertaining and one for sleeping...if your conscience lets you sleep."" The Stranger replies, ""I sleep just fine, Ma'am. Care to see for yourself?"" Sarah leaves in a huff. The Stranger tells Belding he wants fried chicken for dinner with the best bottle of wine in town, then leaves. Mordecai giggles and, when the angry Belding swipes at him, dives under the raised walkway.Under the walkway, Mordecai has a flashback to the night of Marshal Duncan's whipping which he viewed from this same position. The whippers are Bridges and the Carlins. As in the Stranger's dream, the townspeople just watch. The exception is Sarah, who tries to stop it, but is restrained by Lewis.In Callie's bedroom, the Stranger enters while Callie is brushing her hair. She gets a gun from the dresser, but he grabs her wrist and controls it. He tells her he wants her company at dinner. She calls him an animal and says she doesn't eat with dogs. He says, ""You might if it's the dog that runs the pack."" She lets him kiss her and take the gun. She says she needs half an hour to get ready. He returns the gun and leaves.At the hotel, Sarah is serving Callie and the Stranger dinner. She asks, ""Do you have any special request for dessert?"" The Stranger looks at Callie and says, ""No, I've already taken care of that."" Callie smiles. Sarah leaves, disgusted.In the hills, Cole's horse has come up lame, and he suggests they're pushing too hard. This angers Stacey, who says maybe they should leave Cole. Dan tries to calm Stacey, saying Cole can ride double with him. Stacey says, ""When they find those bodies back there, they'll be a hunting party out for us, and I want time to take one year of my life out of Lago before we move on."" They shoot the lame horse and ride on, slower now.Allen and Ross meet Mordecai walking at night. He's been drinking. Allen knocks him cold with a left hook. They look up and watch the light go out in the Stranger's hotel room.In the church, Belding speaks to the church-goers, including Drake. He complains that good people have been thrown out of his hotel, which is now being used for ""fornication and sins of the flesh."" He and Sam argue over who should step in. It gets caustic, and the preacher says, ""Gentlemen, please! Look what's happening to us."" Belding agrees, adding ""It couldn't be worse if the devil himself had ridden right into Lago.""In his hotel room, the Stranger sleeps while Callie sneaks out of bed and gets dressed. Outside, Morgan Allen, Jake Ross, and three henchmen carefully ascend the hotel stairs, which creak anyway. Callie leaves the room and shuts the door, just as the men arrive. The men enter the room and beat the covered figure in bed with axe handles. The Stranger, on a ledge outside the window, lights a stick of dynamite and throws it onto the bed. The attackers see it and rush for the door, but only three escape before the room explodes.Outside, the Stranger shoots two attackers as they retreat down the stairs, leaving only Allen, who ducks into the hotel lobby. The Stranger follows and finds Allen holding Sarah in front of him as a shield. As Allen backs away, the Stranger shoots his exposed shoulder. Allen falls backward to the floor, pulling Sarah down with him. Bleeding badly, he releases Sarah, and scrambles out the back door toward the barn.In the barn, Allen mounts a horse and rides out. Callie pleads with him to take her with him, but he brushes her off and rides on. The Stranger has an easy shot at Callie, but lowers his gun, and she runs away into the darkness.The townspeople arrive, having heard the blast. Upset at the damage to his hotel, Belding lets it slip that he knew about the attack. The Stranger hears and is unhappy. He orders the townsmen to begin digging graves, in the dark, for the four men killed. Drake assures the Stranger he had nothing to do with the attack and offers him a bonus to stick with the agreement. The Stranger doubles it, Drake agrees, and the Stranger turns and steps away. Belding whispers to Drake, questioning the large bonus. Drake whispers back, ""Promising's one thing, paying's another. He might just catch a bullet."" The Stranger says, ""Oh, you and Lewis can grab shovels too.""The Stranger turns to Sarah, who says ""I don't know where you're going to sleep now. All the rooms are ruined, except for our room."" The Stranger looks at her and smirks. Sarah backs away, shaking her head. The Stranger takes her elbow and leads her into the hotel. She calls to Lewis for help. Lewis hears, but does not respond.In the Belding's bedroom, Sarah grabs a pair of shears and backs into a corner. The Stranger lays on the bed, and asks what she is doing. She says she's defending herself, citing Callie's rape. The Stranger plays with her, recalling Callie enjoyed it, and acting as if Sarah wants the same. He says, ""I'd like to oblige you, but a man's got to get his rest sometime."" Sarah, angry at the suggestion, attacks him. He controls her, and forces her to kiss. She stops fighting and submits.The next morning, they are relaxed with each other, Sarah in bed and the Stranger getting dressed. Sarah asks if he has heard of Jim Duncan, who lies in an unmarked grave, adding, ""They say the dead don't rest without a marker."" As he's leaving, she says, ""Be careful. You're a man who makes people afraid and that's dangerous."" He replies, ""It's what people know about themselves, inside, that make them afraid.""At the cemetery, the townsmen are finishing up the four graves. The Stranger is painting something unseen on a sign. At the Strangers behest, Mordecai orders everyone to begin painting the town red. There is grumbling and disbelief, but no dissent. Naylor says, ""I'll paint if you say we got to, but when we get done this place is gonna look like Hell."" As the tired men tote their tools back to town, the sign is revealed. ""Hell"", in red, covers ""Lago"".Lewis enters the Belding bedroom and tells Sarah there is an important meeting they should attend. She refuses, saying the neighbors make her sick. While defending the neighbors, Lewis reveals that Duncan was killed because he had discovered the mine was on government property and was determined to report it. The mine would be closed, ruining the town. He sees the murder as ""the price of progress"", but Sarah can't live with that anymore. She says, ""I'm packing to leave, Lewis. I won't be coming back.""In the hills outside town, Bridges and the Carlins see Allen, near collapse, fall from his horse. Bridges sits him up and tries to persuade him to reveal the combination to the safe in the mining office. He promises that, in return, he'll move Allen into the shade and give him water. Allen curses him. Bridges threatens with a pointed stick, but Allen remains defiant. Bridges drives the stick into his neck, and says ""Two sticks of dynamite will take care of that iron box. We don't need him.""A rifle shot ricochets near Dan's feet, and the three dive behind barely adequate cover. Unbeknownst to them, it's the Stranger, who had been tracking Allen by his blood droplets. Hidden on a ridge above, the Stranger lights a stick of dynamite, leaves it, and changes position. The dynamite explodes while Stacey is firing blindly up the hill, confusing the three, and showering them with debris. Then, from another direction, the Stranger shoots Cole's ear, and the three must hurriedly shift positions. Stacey figures it must be Drake and shouts out, seeking a parley. Getting no response, he fires more shots blindly, and there is another explosion, much closer this time. The three are shook up, filthy, and scratched from the blast. As they listen to the Stranger ride away, still unseen, Stacey screams, ""I'll kill every man in Lago.""The Stranger rides back to Lago which is now completely red. He tells Mordecai, ""The guests are on their way to the party."" Mordecai runs down the street, lined with picnic tables, telling everyone to get ready. He finds the prominent men drinking in the saloon. They are scared and all need one more drink before reluctantly moving outside. The Stranger ties up at the hotel, and on his way in, tells the livery boy to get up in the church tower and ring the bell at the first sign of dust.Bridges and the Carlins ride toward the town, down out of the hills now.The Stranger exits the hotel, having retrieved his overcoat. He walks to the saloon and gets a drink. Sam and Naylor are anxious, wanting him to get ready outside, but he tells them there's plenty of time. Mordecai asks ""What about after we do it? What do we do then?"" The Stranger says, ""Then you live with it.""They walk into the street and watch everyone take their positions. A ""Welcome Home Boys"" banner has been raised at the town's entrance. Mordecai asks, ""When are you going to give the signal?"" The Stranger replies, ""I'm not. You are."" The church bell begins ringing. The Stranger mounts his horse and rides calmly down the back road out of town. The townspeople watch in horror.Bridges and the Carlins arrive, pausing when they see the banner. They draw their guns and gallop down the main street, whooping, shooting, and roping tables. Mordecai yells, ""Fire!"", but they all freeze or panic. Sam is roped and dragged over a collapsing table. Several rooftop gunners are shot or knocked back by splintering wood. The livery boy is shot out of the tower. Stacey catches Drake sneaking out of the mining office, backs him into the lake, and shoots him dead.Later, after dark, the town is ablaze. The battered townspeople are in the saloon being roughed up by Stacey and Dan. Stacey beats Sam back onto a table, yelling, ""A party?"" Cole enters with Callie and throws her to the floor. She tries to convince Stacey she always loved him, but he's not buying it. Cole wants to know who ambushed them, and Stacey says, ""We're going to find out right now."" Then, a whip flies in over the swinging doors, wraps around Cole's neck, and drags him out, choking. The Stranger whips Cole to death in the street while Stacey, Dan, and the townspeople remain inside, stupefied by what they hear. Finally, the bloody whip is thrown into the saloon.Stacey orders everyone out into the street where they gather around Cole's body. Stacey and Dan look for the whipper but see no one. Two sticks with lit fuses fly from behind a building and land near the body. The townspeople scatter, screaming ""Dynamite!"" When the fuses burn out, Stacey examines them and sees they are just sticks of wood. Dan tells Stacey the horses are gone. Stacey and Dan move down opposite sides of the street, guns drawn, searching for the whipper. A whip from above wraps around Dan's neck, lifts him, and hangs him dead from a balcony.While Stacey is looking at Dan's body, a lantern is thrown into the street. Spooked, Stacey fires three times. While Stacey reloads, the Stranger's voice is heard whispering, ""Help me, help me."" The Stranger steps out in front of a burning building behind Stacey, who turns and sees only his silhouette. Stacey takes aim, but the Stranger draws and shoots Stacey's gun from his hand. Stacey yells, ""Who are you?"", and the Stranger shoots him dead.Belding steps out from between buildings and aims a shotgun at the Stranger's back. A shot is fired and Belding falls over dead. Mordecai is revealed, holding his huge revolver. The Stranger nods and walks away.The next morning, the Stranger rides down the smoldering street. Sarah, well dressed, is climbing aboard a buckboard. She and the Stranger exchange nods. The Stranger rides out to the cemetery where Mordecai is carving a grave marker. Mordecai says, ""I never did know your name."" The Stranger replies, ""Yes, you do. Take care."" As Mordecai watches him ride away, the marker is revealed-- ""Marshall Jim Duncan, Rest In Peace.""In the distance, the Stranger disappears into the heat shimmer."

Hermie's transition into adulthood in this environment may have more to do with the natural course of life, than with the global geopolitical situation or what happens at college.—Huggo This is the sequel to Summer of '42. The film is a slice-of-life style autobiography of sorts, depicting the lives of the ""Terrible Trio"" two years after their summer of 1942 on Nantucket.The setting is in 1944 suburban New York City. The film opens with seeing the Trio; Herman ""Hermie"" Raucher (Gary Grimes), and his pals Oscar ""Oscy"" Seltzer (Jerry Houser) and Benjie (Oliver Conant) at their high school commencement exercises.After the graduation ceremony, Hermie throws a final blast-off party at his house.

He tries out for football and makes the team.Hermie and Oscy join a fraternity that Julie has picked out, and go through the ritual of initiation. No sooner do they move into the frat house when Oscy gets expelled from school for having a girl in his room; a major rule violation. When Hermie expresses concern about upcoming exams, Julie teaches him a few tricks on cheating.Hermie and Julie have a falling out when Julie informs him that they can't go to the fall dance together because an old boyfriend was going to be in town and insisted on seeing her that same evening.

It escalates into a shouting match when a phone call brings bad news for Hermie: his father has died suddenly. He returns home for the funeral, where Oscy shows up and pays his respects after the service. He is now in the US Army and is stationed on Governor's Island as a clerk typist. Oscy tries to lift Hermie's sagging spirits by suggesting they go out and have a drink in memory of Hermie's father. Once at the bar, they become inebriated and a brawl breaks out.

Flesh for Frankenstein,1973,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071508/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Baron Frankenstein creates two ""zombies"" - one male, one female - planning to mate them in order to create a master race. In Serbia, middle-aged Baron Frankenstein lives with the Baroness Katrin, his wife/sister and their two teenage children, Monica and Erik. He dreams of a super-race, returning Serbia to its grand connections to ancient Greece. In his laboratory, assisted by Otto, he builds a desirable female body, but needs a male who will be super-body and super-lover. He thinks he has found just the right brain to go with a body he's built, but he's made an error, taking the head of a asexual ascetic. Meanwhile, the Baroness has her lusts, and she fastens on Nicholas, farmhand boy and a friend of the dead lad. Can the Baron pull off his grand plan? He brings the two zombies together to mate. Meanwhile, Nicholas tries to free his dead friend. What about the Baron's children?—<jhailey@hotmail.com> In Serbia, Baron Frankenstein (Udo Kier) lives with the Baroness and their two children. He dreams of a super-race, returning Serbia to its grand connections to ancient Greece. In his laboratory, assisted by Otto, he builds a desirable female body, but needs a male who will be super-body and super-lover.—gavin694222 Teetering on the brink of madness, megalomaniac Baron von Frankenstein is one step closer to fulfilling his unholy aspiration: create the perfect human being from hand-picked body parts and organs. And with hard work, dogged perseverance, and above all, unethical methods, the depraved doctor has managed to put together the ideal female specimen along with his loyal assistant Otto. Now, all that the baron needs to do is build a fitting male counterpart. However, superior brains are hard to come by and, at this stage, even the slightest mistake could prove disastrous. But Frankenstein dies to produce a new race that responds only to his command, and warm flesh is what needs. Where can he find it?—Nick Riganas The movie starts with the Frankenstein children, little nine-year- old Monica (Nicoletta Elmi) and her brother, Erik (Marco Liofredi), playing dissection with a doll. When they are through taking its guts out, Erik, with Monica's approval, chops its head off with a miniature guillotine.We next see the children in the company of their mother, Baroness Katrin Frankenstein (Monique van Vooren) as she brings them home after removing them from a school she no longer approves of. On the way the Baroness observes shepherds Nicholas (Joe Dallesandro) and Sacha (Srdjan Zelenovic). She chides Nicholas for neglecting his work as he sports with a peasant girl.At home her complaints to Baron Frankenstein (Udo Kier) - who is both her brother and her husband - are ignored as he is too busy working on his laboratory project. In the lab he is laboring with Otto (Arno Jürging), his assistant, to create a pair of super-humans by literally piecing together the best body parts they can find. The Baron believes that if he can bring these creatures to life and get them to mate, he can create a race of superior beings only obedient to his commands. The girl creature (Dalila Di Lazzaro) who is lying naked on a table in his lab is almost finished, but the Baron needs a head for his male creation. The Baron is not only concerned with creating living beings, but making ultimately beautiful ones, so he wants to find a male head with a Serbian nose.That night as the maid (Liù Bosisio) serves the family dinner, the Frankensteins argue. The Baroness does not know what to do with the children now they have been taken out of school so the Baron suggests she take them on a picnic. Despite scoffing at this idea, the next day she leads the children into the country-side where she again runs into Nicholas romantically involved with a girl. She scolds him and tells him to report to her at the castle the next morning.Later that day, Nicholas kids his friend Sacha about his desire to be a monk and his lack of interest in girls. He manages to convince Sacha to go with him that night to the local brothel for some fun, though Sacha appears to agree to go along only to make Nicholas happy.The Baron tests out his female creation by making love to it while Otto watches. The Baron has the rather strange fetish of reaching inside her stitches and fondling her gallbladder as the does it.The Baron has determined that in order to ensure the creatures will mate the male must have a large sexual appetite. To select a brain with this characteristic, Otto and he wait outside the brothel that night. They can tell from the sounds there is such a man inside, but they misidentify that man as Sasha (who has the Serbian nose the Baron wants), instead of Nicholas. As Sasha and a drunken Nicholas make their way home that night they are set upon by the Baron and Otto. Nicholas is knocked out and Sasha beheaded. The Baron and his assistant then take their prize back to the lab.The next morning Nicholas awakes and finds Sasha's headless body. He buries him and decides it is time to leave town. Before he does, however, he stops at the castle to keep his appointment with the Baroness. She convinces him instead to stay and become the new stable boy and her secret lover.With Sasha's head on the male's body the Baron's work nears completion. Despite the fact that they do not eat solid food or talk much, he decides to bring his creations to the family dinner table that night. Nicholas, who is serving dinner, is appalled to find his friend's head now attached to a much taller body and decides something sinister must be happening in the Baron's lab.The maid is also snooping around the lab and is caught by Otto who proceeds to chase her down and rape her. When he tries to fondle her gallbladder, as the Baron enjoys doing, however, he accidentally kills her.With the children's help Nicholas sneaks into the lab and observes the Baron's first attempt to mate his creations. Despite ordering the female creature to kiss the male multiple times, the male does not respond and the Baron is furious.Nicholas then goes to the Baroness to warn her about the Baron's work and is surprised when she comes to the Baron's defense. She tells Nicholas not to bother the Baron. She beleives Nicholas's only function at the castle is to serve her sexual needs. At this he storms out of her bedroom in disgust.The Baron is convinced that someone has been in his lab fooling with his work. He confronts his wife, who turns Nicholas in; in return for the Baron's promise to order the male monster to serve her sexual needs for two hours (She does not realize he is dud in the area). Later in her bedroom as she instructs the monster in pleasing her she tells him to hold her tight. He does this too much, however, and breaks her back, killing her.In the lab, the Baron and Otto have caught Nicholas and have him hanging from a pulley by his wrists in mid-air. The Baron plans to use him to fix the male monster's libito problem. When the Baron is out of the room, however, Otto brags to Nicholas he is just as smart as the doctor and proceeds to demonstrate this by making love to the female creature while fondling her gallbladder. He fails to do it right and this kills her. The Baron returns to find the girl creature dead and in a rage strangles Otto.The monster returns to the lab carrying the Baroness's body. At this new turn of events the Baron losses he temper again. He blames Nicholas for ruining his plans and gets a knife to kill him. Before the can commit the murder, however, the monster runs a pike through the Baron's back and out his belly. He dies.Nicholas tells the monster to let him down so they can escape. The monster tells him he finds himself too horrible to live and commits suicide by tearing open his stitches and disembowing himself.This leaves Nicholas hanging from the ceiling while the only two other people left alive in the castle - little Monica and Erik - enter the lab. Instead of freeing Nicholas, however, they pick up large scalpels and we are given the eerie feeling the dissection scene at the beginning of the film is about to be repeated with Nicholas taking the place of the doll. The screen fades to black."

Battle for the Planet of the Apes,1973,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0069768/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Ten years after a worldwide series of ape revolutions and a brutal nuclear war among humans, Caesar must protect survivors of both species from an insidious human cult and a militant ape faction alike. After conquering the oppressive humans in ""Conquest for the Planet of the Apes"", Caesar must now keep the peace among the humans and apes. Gorilla General Aldo views things differently, and tries to cause an ape civil war. In the meantime, other human survivors learn of the ape city, and decide they want to take back civilization for themselves, thus setting the stage of warring ape factions and humans.—Humberto Amador Set in a flashback in the former North American continent of the early 21st century in the year 2003, told by the Great Lawgiver in the year 2670, this latest Planet of the Apes sequel focuses on the chimpanzee ape leader, Caesar (Roddy McDowall), more then a decade after he led the ape revolution in the previous film, 'Conquest of the Planet of the Apes'. In this post-nuclear war society, Caesar tries to cultivate peace between his simian peers and the surviving remains of humanity. A militant gorilla general named Aldo (Claude Akins) however opposes this. Therefore, he plots Caesar's overthrow and doom. Caesar is now married to the chimpanzee Lisa (Natalie Trundy), the female chimpanzee ape of the previous film, and they have a son, named Cornelius (Bobby Porter) in honor of Caesar's late father.Caesar regrets having never known his parents until his human assistant MacDonald (Austin Stoker) informs him that by viewing video taped archives of his parents, he can learn about the future. Caesar learns the archives are in the Forbidden City, once the city in which Caesar was enslaved, and is now in nuclear ruins.After obtaining weapons from an armory run by the orangutan Mandemus (Lew Ayres), Caesar travels with MacDonald and his orangutan advisor Virgil (Paul Williams) to the Forbidden City and sneaks in to find the recorded archives. However, there are radiation-scarred humans still living in the Forbidden City, now under the command of Governor Kolp (Severn Darden), the former police chief under the late Governor Beck and who is now the current leader and governor. Caesar and his party view the video and audio recordings of Cornelius and Zira (from 'Escape from the Planet of the Apes') and learn about the future of the world, but barely have enough time to study the tapes before they must escape or risk capture or death.Back in Ape City, Caesar assembles a meeting with the citizens to report his discoveries at the Forbidden City. Aldo objects when some humans show up at the meeting and leads the gorillas away.In the Forbidden City, a three-man scout group sent by Governor Kolp return and tell them about the Ape City. Kolp considers this clandestine entrance by Caesar an act of espionage while his subordinate Méndez (Paul Stevens) says that they did nothing wrong and should be allowed to go in peace. Governor Kolp then declares war on Ape City, mustering the mutant humans from the Forbidden City to destroy the ape society once and for all.That night, Aldo is furious over the fact that Caesar wants to co-exist peacefully with humans and plots a military coup in order to install himself as the leader of Ape City. Cornelius (while climbing a tree) overhears this when trying to catch his pet squirrel, but is spotted by Aldo who hacks at the branch with his sword causing Cornelius to fall to the ground and suffer serious injuries and he becomes bedridden. After one of the ape scouts is wounded by Governor Kolp, Aldo takes action into his own hands and orders all humans rounded into the corral. Then, Aldo leads the gorillas to loot Mandemus' armory for its weapons.The next morning, Cornelius succumbs to his wounds leaving Caesar devastated. Upon learning about Aldo's actions from Virgil, Caesar leaves Cornelius's side to confront Aldo, but Kolp's ragtag force of mutant humans launches their attack against Ape City at that moment delaying Caesar's and Aldo's confrontation until after the battle as both Caesar and Aldo are forced to team up to fight the attacking mutant humans.The mutants attack on Ape City initially succeeds after an artillery barrage destroys or damages many homes and buildings, forcing Caesar to order the defenders to fall back. When Kolp finds Caesar lying wounded among st the apes on the ground, he taunts him saying the apes would once again be humanity's slaves or die, and is about to shoot him. But then Lisa cries out, and Kolp is distracted. Caesar shouts, ""Now, fight like apes!,"" and most of the fallen apes all around them, who were feigning death (clearly on Caesar's orders) or hiding, launch a counter-attack that captures most of the mutants and drives Kolp into retreat. Kolp and his remaining forces are killed by Aldo and his mounted troops in the open while trying to escape in a school bus.After the battle, Aldo wants to kill all the humans in the pen, but Caesar shields them for they were not part of Kolp's army and thus killed nobody. Aldo declares that Caesar should be killed if he shields the humans. But before he can carry this out, he lets it slip that Cornelius' death was not due to an accident, but Aldo's malevolence. The ape community immediately grows angry and concludes that the society's sacred law (""ape must never kill ape"") has been broken. As the community repeats ""ape has killed ape!"", an infuriated Caesar pursues Aldo up a large tree, and their fight results in Aldo's death when he falls. Caesar then goes to free the humans, but they refuse to leave the pen unless things change. MacDonald insists that freedom is meaningless without being treated as equals. Caesar then realizes the apes are just as evil and despicable as the former slave-owners if they treat the humans as second class citizens. The apes and humans then decide to co-exist with one another and begin to work side-by-side in rebuilding their community and make a new society. They store their guns in the armory; Caesar and Virgil reluctantly explain to Mandemas that they will still need their weapons for future conflicts and can only wait for the day when they will no longer need them.(Note: it is implied by viewers that Aldo was originally the ape that led the revolution that overthrew human society, but due to the fact that Caesar's late parents, Cornelius and Zira, had arrived on Earth from the future and had conceived Caesar, that they actually changed the course of history and the time line that has resulted in Caesar leading the ape revolution instead of Aldo whom only played a minor part in it. With Caesar finally being aware of all this, and Aldo now dead and gone, he and the apes and humans can now create their own future of what they will make of it.)In the final scene, the wizened orangutan teacher at the beginning of the film, known in ape society as the Great Lawgiver (John Huston), finishes the narration begun in the prologue all about the life of the late great chimpanzee leader Caesar who united the world in peace... to a mixed group of young human and ape children in an outdoor classroom. The setting is now the year 2670, over 600 years in the future. In complete contrast to the first 'Planet of the Apes' movie, instead of humanity falling and apes rising to take their place as the dominant species on Earth, the two species have continued to co-exist. The Lawgiver notes that their society still waits for a day when their world will no longer need weapons, while they ""wait with hope"". When asked by a human child at what the future will hold and if man and ape will continue to live together in peace (among the next 1,300 years before the first 'Planet of the Apes' movie thus bringing the series full circle), the Lawgiver states that only the dead know about the future. The final shot zooms over to a life-size stone statue of Caesar and shows a single tear falling from the statue's left eye... (implying that peaceful coexistence of apes and humans will not last forever)."

The answer is Soylent Green-an artificial nourishment whose actual ingredients are not known by the public. Thorn (Charlton Heston) is the tough homicide detective who stumbles onto the secret so terrifying no one would dare believe him. A tale of Earth in despair in 2022. Natural food like fruits, vegetables, and meat, among others are now extinct. Earth is overpopulated and New York City has 40 million starving, poverty-stricken people. The only way they survive is with water rations and eating a mysterious food called Soylent. A detective investigates the murder of the president of the Soylent company. The truth he uncovers is more disturbing than the Earth in turmoil when he learns the secret ingredient of Soylent Green.—Mystic80 In the year 2022, Earth's face has completely changed. New York City's population, for example, has grown to 40 million mouths to feed. The greenhouse effect has risen the temperature into nearly unbearable regions, and the people are kept in the cities by law. The rich live in separated luxury apartments (with women as part of the rented furniture) but also experience the lack of natural food. Strawberries are at $150 for a glass of them. Police Detective Thorn investigates a strange murder case of an official from the Soylent corporation, which feeds the masses with a palette of their creations: Soylent red, yellow, or--even more nutritious--green.—Julian Reischl <julianreischl@mac.com> In the year 2022, the population has grown to 40 million people in New York City alone. Most housing is dilapidated and overcrowded, and the homeless fill the streets and line the fire escapes, stairways of buildings, abandoned cars, subway platforms, etc. Unemployment is at around 50%. Summers are oppressively hot and humid with temperatures over 90F degrees during the day and night due to Earth's recent climate change resulting from the Greenhouse Effect. Food, as we know it in this present time, is a rare and expensive commodity. Technology is at a standstill as most of planet Earth's natural resources are gone including most trees. Most of the World's population survives on processed rations produced by the massive Soylent Corporation, including Soylent Red and Soylent Yellow, which are advertised as ""high-energy vegetable concentrates"". The newest product is Soylent Green: small green wafers which are advertised as being produced from ""high-energy plankton"". It is much more nutritious and palatable than the red and yellow varieties but, like most other foods, in short supply which often leads to weekly food riots.Robert Thorn (Charlton Heston) is a New York City Police Department detective from the 14th Precinct who lives in a dilapidated, cramped one-room apartment with his aged friend and roommate, Solomon ""Sol"" Roth (Edward G. Robinson). Roth is a former college professor whose job is to sort through the now-disordered remnants of written records and books to help Thorn's investigations. Roth and his like are known as ""books."" He tells Thorn about the time before the ecological disaster and population crisis of the early 2000s, when real food was plentiful, although Thorn is generally not interested in the stories, finding most of them too hard to believe.Thorn is assigned to investigate the murder of William R. Simonson (Joseph Cotten), a 68-year-old wealthy lawyer living in a luxury high-rise apartment building called Chelsea Towers West. At the crime scene, Thorn first talks with the building superintendent Charles (Philip Stone) about discovering the body. Charles leads Thorn to the 22nd floor and to Simonson's apartment which is 22A. Thorn finds Simonson lying in a pool of blood after having been struck multiple times in the back of the head with a sharp object which is speculated to be a meat hook or an ax. Instead of looking for clues, the poorly paid detective helps himself to the wealthy man's food, liquor and books and even enjoys taking a shower (with real hot water and soap). He questions Shirl (Leigh Taylor-Young), an attractive 23-year-old ""concubine"" (euphemistically known as ""furniture"") who comes with the apartment, and Simonson's bodyguard, Tab Fielding (Chuck Connors), who claims that he was told to escort Shirl on a shopping trip when the attack took place. The sanitation crew led by Wagner arrives to take Simonson's dead body away, as Thorn leaves after collecting a written statement from Fielding.Returning to his apartment, Thorn gives Roth the Soylent Oceanographic Survey Report, 2015 to 2019, a two-volume work which he took from Simonson's apartment. Thorn returns to work at the 14th Precinct during that evening where they're hundreds of people lining up to collect death benefit money from recently diseased friends and family members. Thorn talks to his superior officer, Lieutenant Hatcher (Brock Peters), telling him that he suspects the Simonson homicide may have been an assassination, since nothing was stolen from the apartment and the murder seemed professional. Thorn also finds it odd that the luxury apartment's sophisticated alarm and monitoring electronics, including the building's security cameras, happened to be inoperative on the night of the murder, and Simonson's bodyguard just happened to be out of the apartment at the time. Thorn confides in Lt. Hatcher that he suspects that Fielding might have had something to do with Simonson's murder.The next day, Thorn stakes out Fielding's apartment building and sees him leave. Thorn lets himself into Fielding's apartment where he questions Fielding's live-in ""furniture"", Martha (Paula Kelly), about his work for Simonson. Thorn returns to his own apartment to eat an evening meal of the purloined food taken from Simonson's apartment that Roth prepares for them. Afterwards, Roth tells Thorn about the research he did on the murder victim and that Simonson was a member of the board of directors of the Soylent Corporation. When he presents Roth with a spoon of strawberry jam surreptitiously palmed from Fielding's apartment, Roth tastes it and declares that Fielding's ""furniture"" is eating some ""$150-a-jar"" strawberry jam, which is an out-of-place luxury for the mistress of a bodyguard.That evening, Thorn returns to the Chelsea Towers West to question Shirl, who tells him that Simonson became deeply troubled in the days before his death, even taking her to a local Catholic church. Shirl is throwing a party in Simonson's vacant apartment for the other ""furniture"" girls of the building. Just then, Charles arrives and begins yelling and hitting the women for slacking off until Thorn arrives back in the living room to stop Charles from hurting the girls anymore. After sending Charles and the rest of the furniture girls away, Thorn returns to Shirl and they make love.A little later that same evening, Thorn goes to a local Catholic Church (teeming with hundreds of homeless people) and attempts to question the priest (Lincoln Kirkpatrick) about Simonson's confession, but the priest is almost catatonic with exhaustion and has a hard time remembering Simonson, even though Simonson, as a rich man, would have stood out among the impoverished people who normally frequent the church. When the priest remembers Simonson, he tells Thorn the memory of what Simonson told him during confession which is haunting him, and he is unable to describe what Simonson said to him because it was ""too horrible"". The next day, Fielding goes to the church and murders the priest in the confessional booth to ensure he never talks again.The next morning, as Thorn begins uncovering more evidence as to why Simonson was murdered, New York State's Governor, Joseph Santini (Whit Bissell), who was once Simonson's partner in a high-profile law firm and who is running for re-election (as shown in the campaign posters on such walls as that of Hatcher's office), instructs Hatcher to close the investigation. However, Thorn continues his investigation into the murder. When Governor Santini learns that Thorn refuses to close the case of the Simonson murder, he orders his chief of security, Donovan (Roy Jensen), to have Thorn murdered.When Thorn is on riot duty during the Tuesday distribution of Soylent Green rations, Simonson's murderer, Gilbert (Stephen Young), a local assassin-for-hire whom was the one that Donovan contracted to murder Simonson, attacks Thorn and fires several shots at him with a silenced pistol as a food riot begins. Thorn chases his attacker into the thick crowd as large dump trucks called ""scoops"" designed by the NYC Riot Police, arrive to pick up closely packed rioters and ""scoop"" them into the trucks. But before Thorn can capture Gilbert, who manages to wound Thorn by shooting him in his right calf, the assassin is crushed to death under the ""scoop"" of one of the riot control vehicles.Thorn goes back to Fielding's apartment and beats him and his mistress Martha for the attempt on his life. Thorn then goes back to Shirl at Simonson's apartment where she removes the bullet and stitches his wound. Shirl tells Thorn that a new tenant will be arriving soon at the apartment and is hoping to move in, but she has romantic feelings for Thorn. Thorn tells Shirl that he will let her know if she wants to stay with him or the new tenant of Simonson's apartment. After resting for about an hour, Thorn leaves the apartment into the evening as sirens for the nightly curfew begin sounding. Sometime later a new potential tenant, a brash high-class businessman, arrives at the apartment and questions Shirl about herself and describes his daily details should he decide move in and want to keep her as ""furniture"".Meanwhile, Roth examines Soylent's oceanographic reports at the Supreme Exchange, a library and gathering place for fellow ""books."" The ""books"" and Roth finally realize that the reports indicate a ""horrible"" truth which, despite reading it for themselves, they find nearly impossible to believe; Soylent Green isn't made from plankton, it's made from human bodies. Unable to live with what he has uncovered, Roth opts for assisted suicide at a government clinic (in the former Madison Square Garden, which had been converted to a clinic for mass euthanasia), a process referred to as ""going home"". As Roth is dying, he watches video clips of Earth long ago when animal (sheep, deer, and horses) and plant life was thriving and there was no pollution, while listening to light classical music.Thorn returns to his apartment and finds a note from Roth that he is ""going home"". Thorn races to the clinic and forces one staff attendant (Dick Van Patten) to allow him to see and talk to Roth. During Roth's final moments, he tells Thorn the secret of Soylent Green, and begs him to follow his body to the processing center and report back to the Supreme Exchange so they can take the information to the Council of Nations to take action.Thorn sneaks into the basement of the assisted suicide facility, where he sees corpses being loaded onto waste disposal trucks. He secretly hitches a ride on one, which is driven to a heavily guarded waste disposal plant just outside the city. The black-clad sanitation drivers are escorted at gunpoint out of the truck where a white-clad plant worker takes over driving. The sanitation worker is escorted to another truck leaving the fortress-like facility to drive back to the city. Once inside the plant, Thorn sees how the corpses are processed into Soylent Green wafers. They are loaded onto a conveyor belt and driven through a large machine about several hundred yards long, and the Soylent Green wafers come out on the other end. But Thorn is spotted by two plant workers and is chased. Thorn kills one and subdues another before he escapes from the plant just when the alarm is sounded.Thorn returns to the teeming city and heads for the Supreme Exchange to report what he found, but is ambushed by Fielding and three other gunmen (all of whom presumably work for the government and are also aware and are trying to conceal the secret about Soylent Green). Thorn manage to get to a police payphone and call Shirl to tell her that he loves her and to stay with the new tenant whom wants to rent Simonson's vacant apartment. Thorn also manages to place a second call to Lt. Hatcher at the 14th Precinct to tell him where he is and that he is being attacked, but then gets cut off when the assassins close in.During a chase through the deserted streets and alleys (cleared of people because of the government-imposed dusk to dawn curfew), Thorn manages to kill all the gunmen chasing him except for Fielding who shoots Thorn in the back. He retreats into a cathedral filled with homeless people and Fielding follows him. After a desperate fight through throngs of sleeping homeless, Thorn kills Fielding by stabbing him with a rusted kitchen knife.When police backup arrives at the church, the seriously wounded and nearly hysterical Thorn confides to Lt. Hatcher the horrible secret behind Soylent Green, while Hatcher looks on with disbelief. As Thorn is being carried away by the police on a stretcher to a local hospital, he urges to Hatcher to spread the word and shouts out to the spectators: ""Soylent Green is PEOPLE!! We've got to stop them... SOMEHOW!!!"""

Walking Tall,1973,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070895/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Based on the life of Tennessee sheriff Buford Pusser, who almost single-handily cleaned up his small town of crime and corruption, but at a personal cost of his family life and nearly his own life. A surprise hit when it premiered, Walking Tall carried the theme of one man standing up for his sense of right and wrong. Selmer, a small town in southwest Tennessee, served as the authentic background for the bio-pic of the heroic southern Sheriff. Joe Don Baker did an admirable job with the role, and the hugely violent film was a surprise hit. Former Sheriff Pusser himself was set to portray himself in the sequel, but he died in a car crash as he as returning from his contract signing in California. The sequel was filmed using Swedish actor Bo Svensen, and a Final Chapter sequel told of Pusser's demise. While the Walking Tall franchise will never be on any list of Classic Film, the original is a great slice of Americana, Circa '70s. It made Bakers' career and perhaps kicked the 'southsploitation' genre of that decade into gear.—rick rothermel Buford Pusser's a wrestler, whose wife wants him to settle down, so they go to his home town in Tennessee, where he plans to get into business with his father.

When the criminals attack his family, Buford shoots a whorehouse manager in the head and runs hillbilly gangsters over with his car.—Doug Mosurak <marumaru@andrew.cmu.edu> Set in the mid 1960s, Buford Pusser (Joe Don Baker) returns with his family to his hometown of Adamsville, Tennessee after a stint in Chicago as a professional wrestler. Pusser moves his wife Pauline (Elizabeth Hartman) and their two children, Mike (Leif Garrett) and Dwana (Dawn Lyn), into a home a short distance from his parents, Carl (Noah Beery) and Helen (Lurene Tuttle). Soon after settling in, Buford reunites with old friend Lutie McVeigh (Ed Call), who is delighted to show Buford just how much the area has changed in his absence by taking him to the Lucky Spot roadhouse one afternoon. After Lutie promptly loses money playing craps, he borrows $50 from Buford who then watches the next round carefully. Spotting a player with an extra pair of dice, Buford accuses him of cheating, prompting the proprietor Buel Jaggers (Arch Johnson) and his men to attack Buford. A fierce brawl ensues in which Lutie is knocked out and Buford is eventually overpowered by four men. On Jaggers orders, his men carve several deep wounds into Buford's chest and back before dumping him in a roadside ditch and driving away in his car.After being taken home by a trucker, Buford is treated by Dr. Lamar Stivers (Don Keefer) and questioned by Sheriff Al Thurman (Gene Evans), who downplays the assault as men letting off steam. A few days later, Thurman returns to the Pusser home with his deputy Grady Coker (Bruce Glover) to report that he has not located Buford's car. Although Thurman implies that Lutie's reputation for telling tall tales will not help Buford if he presses charges against Jaggers, Buford insists on proceeding.After commencing work at his father's logging farm, Buford meets school friend Obra Eaker (Felton Perry), a young black man, and hires him immediately. When no action is taken on Bufords charge against Jaggers and his men, Buford fashions a large stick at the mill and goes to the Lucky Spot at closing where he bashes in the arm of each of the men involved in his assault. Buford then demands the frightened bookkeeper reimburse him for his lost car, his hospital bills and the money taken from him and Lutie.The next day, the corrupt Sheriff Thurman arrests Buford on charges of assault and robbery and, after Judge R.W. Clarke (Douglas V. Fowley) threatens him with a long sentence, Buford decides to represent himself in court. Just before the trial is about to begin, Carl informs Buford that Lutie's body has been discovered in the lake. Informing the jury that his only witness has been killed, Buford removes his shirt to display the multiple scars from his attack, prompting the jury to clear Buford of all charges. Delighted, Obra then suggests that Buford use his new popularity to run against Thurman for sheriff. Although Pauline pleads with Buford not to involve himself further in the regions rampant corruption, Buford decides to run against Thurman.Incensed, Thurman begins tracking Buford, hoping to catch him in any minor infraction. Pleased to find Buford speeding one day, Thurman races after him and tries to force Buford off the road several times, only to drive off a bridge and crash. Buford is able to pull Grady to safety, but the car burns before he can rescue Thurman.Soon after at the Lucky Spot, Jaggers meets with the other area club gangster owners, including Augie McCullah (Kenneth Tobey), the head of the regions illegal activities, and Callie Hacker (Rosemary Murphy), the madam who runs the sprawling Pine Ridge Club brothel. Despite Callie's orders to the others to spend lavishly to prevent Buford from being elected, he wins.On his first day as sheriff, Buford commands his deputies to apply the law equally and accept no bribes. Soon after, Buford is summoned to a morgue to view the bodies of eight black civil rights workers who died after apparently drinking poisoned moonshine. Offering Obra a position as deputy sheriff, Buford presses him for help and Obra takes him to the areas largest still, run by Willie Rae Lockman (Sam Laws), a black man who also owns a small nightclub near the Mississippi border. Arresting everyone at the still, Buford is dismayed when Judge Clarke later throws out all the charges because the new sheriff did not follow proper procedures in securing warrants and informing the accused of their rights.Although frustrated, Buford proceeds more carefully and soon has his deputies making regular checks for illegal liquor at the areas bars and roadhouses. Some time later, Buford receives a visit by government representative John Witter (Logan Ramsey), who advises Buford that harassing local businesses has ramifications in the state capital, Nashville. When Buford refuses Witters invitation to visit Nashville, Witter cautions him that ideals and reality are often very far apart.Undaunted, Buford, Obra, Grady and the deputies resume making surprise checks on all the clubs, angering the various owners, but Callie warns that Witter has instructed them to leave Buford alone temporarily as his activities in McNairy County have received attention in the Nashville press. Meanwhile, Buford remains frustrated in his dealings with the corrupt Judge Clarke, who continually undercuts guilty verdicts of gamblers and liquor runners by applying minimal fines and few detentions.Later, Buford is outraged when a surprise simultaneous mass search of all the area clubs yields no illegal activities, suggesting there is an informer on Buford's staff. One night while taking a back road home, a car races past Buford and when he gives chase and pulls the car over, he is shot twice in the chest. Recovering at home, Buford bitterly notes the get-well gifts from the corrupt club owners and, despite Pauline's pleas, insists he must start carrying a gun in addition to his large stick.Soon after, Buford assembles all his deputies and proceeds to a new still that he plans to destroy. There he accuses deputy Virgil Button (Ted Jordan) of betraying him, as he is the only one who knew of Buford driving the back roads home. When Virgil breaks down and admits to taking bribes, Buford fires him.Over the next several days, Buford makes numerous successful raids on the clubs, prompting Callie to suspect that the organization now has a leak. Although Jaggers suggests killing Buford, Callie hesitates as Witter's has not authorized so drastic an act. Acting on his own, one of Jaggers men ambushes Buford's home a few nights later, firing two shot gun blasts through the living room window, resulting in the death of the family dog. Buford runs after the assailant and kills him.Soon after, Luan Paxton (Brenda Benét), one of the prostitutes at the Lucky Spot who has befriended Buford and has been informing him about the illegal activities the gangs are part of, telephones him with a tip that Callie and her henchman are torturing one of the other girls, Margie Ann, whom they suspect of informing. Buford rescues Margie Ann and beats up Callie's man in front of her. Later, Buford provides Luan with money to leave town safely.Outraged by Buford's boldness, Callie fakes the robbery of a jewel salesman on Christmas Day at the Lucky Spot to lure Buford there. When he arrives, she opens fire on him with a shotgun blast that hits several customers, but misses the sheriff, who shoots and kills her.After Callie's death, there is a lull in criminal activity in McNairy County. One morning, shortly after a pleasant picnic with his family, Buford receives an early morning call regarding trouble at a new still, and when Pauline asks to accompany Buford, he agrees. On the drive, two cars carrying Jaggers, McCullah and their men drive by the Pussers and riddle the car with gunshots, killing Pauline with a random shot to the back of her head. Pulling over, Buford hysterically radios for help, but Jaggers and McCullah drive by again, shoot Buford in the face and leave him for dead.Soon after Pauline's funeral, Buford, swathed in a heavy neck and face cast, drives out to the Lucky Spot and plows his car into the club, running down Jaggers and McCullah. Afterward, Obra and Grady arrive to take Buford back to the hospital while numerous townsfolk set fire to the Lucky Spot to reclaim law and order for their town."
Magnum Force,1973,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070355/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Inspector ""Dirty"" Harry Callahan pursues a conspiracy of vigilante cops, who are not above going beyond the law to kill San Francisco's undesirables. San Francisco Police Inspector ""Dirty"" Harry Callahan (Clint Eastwood) and his new partner, Earlington ""Early"" Smith (Felton Perry) have been temporarily reassigned from Homicide to Stakeout Duty. Meanwhile, those of the city's criminals who manage to avoid punishment by the courts are nevertheless being killed by unknown assassins. Callahan begins to investigate the murders despite orders from his superior officer, Lieutenant Neil Briggs (Hal Holbrook). A man has to know his limitations.—Bruce Janson <bruce@cs.su.oz.au> After taking down the deranged Scorpio Killer inDirty Harry (1971), the nonconformist but effective San Francisco police officer, Inspector ""Dirty"" Harry Callahan, is perplexed by a series of killings of known criminals. Having noticed that all homicides have been committed by a .357 Magnum, the weapon of choice by the SFPD force, Callahan suspects that there might be cops responsible for wiping out crime bosses. This time, stone-faced, no-nonsense Harry will have to go to great lengths to shed light on the string of murders, not knowing, however, how deep the corruption goes. Could there be an extreme vigilante in their midst?—Nick Riganas Several criminals who have eluded the law are being gunned down by cops on motorcycles. San Francisco Inspector ""Dirty"" Harry Callahan (Clint Eastwood), who was reassigned to stakeout duty is assigned the case because his superiors are afraid that this is some kind of gang war. But Harry suspects that they have a vigilante on their hands, quite possibly a cop.—rcs0411@yahoo.com The opening credits are played over a shot of a Smith & Wesson Model 29 revolver against a red background. When the credits finish playing, Harry Callahan's voice tells the audience, ""This the .44 Magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world. And it could blow your head clean off. Do you feel lucky?"" The hand turns the revolver and fires at the camera.Labor racketeer and local mobster Carmine Ricca (Richard Devon) drives away from court after being acquitted on a technicality for the killing of a labor union leader and his family, much to the outrage of a mob of protesters outside the courthouse. A San Francisco Police Department motorcycle cop with a photo on his dresser sees this on a TV broadcast and puts on his helmet and gear, then leaves his house.Ricca, his attorney Weinstein, a bodyguard, and his driver James ""Gino"" Cantina drive a limo south on I-280 towards Potrero Hill. The motorcycle cop we just saw earlier catches up to the car and gestures for the driver to pull over. The driver pulls off onto a side street at the next exit, and comes to a stop. The cop walks up to the car and asks the driver for his license, telling him that he illegally crossed a double-white line. At Ricca's attorney's urging, the driver reluctantly hands over his license. The cop goes back to his bike, supposedly to write down information in his ticket book. After a few minutes, he returns and asks the driver for his vehicle registration. The driver asks to get his license back. In response, the cop suddenly whips his revolver out and shoots the limo driver in the side of the face. He then shoots the bodyguard in the passenger's seat as he tries to draw a pistol. He then puts two bullets each into Ricca and his attorney in the backseat. With all four men dead, the cop holsters his smoking revolver, walks back to his motorcycle and rides away.Inspector 'Dirty' Harry Callahan (Clint Eastwood) and his partner Earlington 'Early' Smith (Felton Perry) drive by the crime scene, but are asked to leave by Harry's newest adversary on the force, the hot-tempered Lt. Neil Briggs, who had Harry ""loaned"" from Homicide to Stakeout because he despises his methods (presumably also angered that Harry got his badge back after throwing it away in disgust following the Scorpio case). The loathing is mutual; Harry detests Briggs because of Briggs's hands-off, bleeding-heart law enforcement methods - Riggs proudly boasts that he's never upholstered his gun once in all his years of police work, which leads the unimpressed Harry to mock Briggs with the words, ""A man's got to know his limitations.""Harry and Early leave the scene and head to San Francisco International Airport to take lunch at a snack shop run by Bill McKenzie, a former buddy of Harry's from the force. Early, as a comparatively wet-behind-the-ears youngster on the force, is grossed out when McKenzie talks about the Ricca killing and a case he worked on involving a gruesome axe murder, all the while Harry chows down on his burger as though nothing is untoward.But a code signal for trouble comes, and Harry notices a group of concerned airport officials gathering around a small cul-de-sac. Harry investigates and finds that airport security is sweating out the hijacking of a jetliner; Harry flashes his badge and learns the hijackers want an overseas pilot, so Harry makes a suggestion.Dressed as a pilot, Harry gets aboard the plane and begins taxiing towards the runway for takeoff, but when the copilot asks if he knows how to fly, he admits that he never had a lesson... which shocks the gunmen in the cockpit long enough for Harry to disarm one and kill the other, and gives him opportunity to show up Lt. Briggs when he arrives at the scene. The dislike between Callahan and Briggs thus escalates; when the surprised Briggs arrives at the now-freed aircraft Harry mockingly asks him, ""What are you doing here, Lieutenant?"" and leaves while the lieutenant seethes at being shown up.Later Harry arrives at a target range near Oakland and encounters an old friend, traffic officer Charlie McCoy (Mitchell Ryan). McCoy has recently left his wife Carol, though it is clear he still holds her close to his heart, and is bitter over how his life has changed. Harry, concerned, suggests Charlie retire, but Charlie vows never to do so and instead ""go out fighting"".In the target range Harry encounters four rookie traffic cops Philip Sweet (Tim Matheson), John Davis (David Soul), Donald ""Red"" Astrachan (Kip Niven), and Michael Grimes (Robert Urich), who practice incessantly and are inseparable buddies from their days as Army Rangers. Harry chats with them for a few minutes and even lets Phil Sweet try his .44; he is impressed by Sweet's dexterity with the heavy revolver and with the four young policemen overall.The next day, the mystery motorcycle cop drives out to Tiburon, and the hillside estate of a known gangster who is hosting a swimming party. After parking his bike, he walks up the hill, creeping through the bushes, equipped with a satchel charge and an M76 sub-machine gun. He tosses the satchel charge into the pool to get the attention of the party-goers, who stare up at him, at which point he opens fire - gunning down everyone in attendance. As the bodies lie dead around or even in the pool, the officer walks back to his motorcycle and rides away. Briggs appears later on a broadcast condemning the violence.Harry is watching the newscast at Carol McCoy's house, and she is glad that the ordeal of her divorce is now over; she then asks Harry why he's never hit on her, but her seduction is interrupted by the play of her rambunctious children, then by a phone call to Harry from Early, who is part of a stakeout at a general store where possible robbery suspects have arrived.Harry thus is forced to cut short his dinner date with Carol and drive to the back entrance of the Cost Plus World Market on Taylor Street, where through a two-way mirror in the manager's office, he and a uniformed officer monitor as Early and two checkout associates attend to customers. A man who is at the magazine rack leaves and then returns with three salty-looking dudes who promptly conjure shotguns and pistols. The group's leader punches the store's eldest associate, orders him to find the store safe, and then orders Early to his knees - a fatal mistake, for it gives Harry the opening to shoot him through the mirror. A gun battle erupts. Early shoots one of the robbers out front, the driver gets away, and the last man is shot dead by Harry. After the robbery is stopped, Harry and Early return to headquarters to finish the ensuing paperwork and they pass the four rookie cops, whom Early knows from their days at the police academy.Later that night, we see a prostitute cut in line at the Fairmont Hotel downtown to get a taxicab. When she is about to climb out of the cab at her destination, the pimp (Albert Popwell) she is coming to see suddenly appears out of nowhere and roughly shoves her back into the cab and orders the driver to take off. He finds that she has been holding money from him and warns her that she just had her last chance. Angered, he attacks her and attempts to rape her. The cab driver, seeing the struggle, stops the cab and runs off to call the police. Inside the cab, the pimp pours an entire bottle of drain cleaner into the girl's mouth. As she writhes and convulses, the pimp takes his hat and the emptied bottle with him as he leaves, and we see the prostitute's arm fall out, limp, and dead.Some time later, the pimp is driving across the Golden Gate Bridge when the vigilante motorcycle cop catches up to him and signals for him to pull over. The pimp takes the first exit, makes a left turn through the underpass, and stops on the service road underneath the north approach to the bridge. The pimp, as an extra precaution, hides a revolver under his crotch between his pant legs. The motorcycle cop dismounts his bike and walks up to the car, and claims to have caught the pimp speeding. He asks the pimp for his license and vehicle registration, and the pimp pulls out his wallet, flipping it to show his license, as well as a wad of $100 bills. He fails to notice the cop slowly raising his revolver. The pimp's eyes suddenly widen with horror just as the cop shoots him in the side of the neck. As the pimp writhes in the seat, the cop empties the rest of his bullets into his chest. The cop then re-holsters his revolver, walks back to his motorcycle, and rides off as the pimp bleeds to death.Harry returns home that night where a new neighbor, a young woman named Sunny, greets him; a long-time admirer of his heroism, Sunny offers Harry her own gratitude by asking to bed him. But they are interrupted when Lt. Briggs calls Harry to the city morgue to view the bodies of victims of the vigilante, all of them known criminals, which include the freshly deceased pimp. Harry is reassigned to Homicide by his and Briggs's superior, Captain Avery, but a clue is difficult to come by there are no witnesses to the murders though uniformed patrolmen keep finding the bodies, and ballistics checks of the bullets reveal uselessly generic information about the weapons used.The next day, Harry and Early examine a bullet recovered from the pimp's body that proves to be a .357 Magnum round. Harry and Early also examine the pimp's car at the crime lab, learning from the ballistics expert that the killer emptied an entire magazine into the pimp from point-blank range. When he notices that the pimp was holding out his driver's license and a $100 bill like he was trying to bribe a traffic cop, Harry begins to suspect that the killer of these criminals is someone they'd never suspect. He thus begins to clash with Briggs when Briggs suspects harbor side racketeer Frank Palancio, who had worked with Ricca in the past, may be behind the murders.Harry and Early tail Palancio and harass him as he is driven around the city. But elsewhere, the vigilante cop reaches the top of a penthouse in Pacific Heights, puts a silencer on his revolver, and guns down drug kingpin Lou Guzman and three of his associates (who are being monitored by Harry's friend Frank DiGiorgio and his partner from an office building a block away) with a suppressed Colt Python. As the killer makes his way to the basement, he runs into Charlie McCoy, exiting the utility room. McCoy seems to recognize the killer cop and thinks he is just another fellow officer... until the killer cop raises his revolver and shoots McCoy in the chest. McCoy falls, his helmet falling off, at which point the mystery cop shoots him again in the head, then leaves. Upon seeing DiGiorgio, the cop tells them of McCoy's shooting, then holds back bystander. The killer cop removes his helmet... revealing himself to be Davis.Lt. Briggs chews out Harry for harassing Palancio before revealing McCoy's death. Harry and Davis see Charlie's widow and her kids off for the funeral flight back east, and Harry thanks Davis for showing his support. But Harry harbors suspicions about Davis; when they stumble into a robbery attempt at a bowling alley they subdue the robbers before Davis furiously dresses down bystanders for letting such crimes take place.Later, Davis and Harry compete in a police shooting contest. To prove his suspicions right, Harry borrows Davis's revolver and deliberately misses one target. He recovers it and matches it to the bullets from Charlie McCoy's body. But Harry is reluctant to reveal all he knows when he shows Lt. Briggs a bullet under a forensic microscope, as he now trusts no one.His mistrust proves warranted when a police raid hits Palancio's harbor side offices. Harry has asked for Davis and Sweet to back him up. Palancio and his men are having lunch in the office when they receive an anonymous phone call from an unseen person warning them that they will be attacked in two minutes by hit men disguised as cops. When Sweet knocks on the door, Palancio blasts him from behind the door with a shotgun, and a gun battle ensues. Harry takes out one thug wielding a sub-machine gun before backup arrives. After backup arrives, Davis manages to take out two thugs in the main office single-handedly. As Palancio attempts to flee, Harry clings onto the hood of his car, distracting Palancio, who dies when he takes a wrong turn and is skewered on a crane.When Briggs and Captain Avery try to blame Harry for the debacle, Harry fights back by noting Palancio's men fired first, indicating they were tipped off. Briggs refuses to believe it, vows to ruin Callahan's career, and has Harry hand over the bullet he showed earlier.But the bullet is a fake, as Harry still has the one he found earlier. He now reveals all to Early Smith as he gives him the bullet to give to Briggs if anything happens to Harry. Harry, however, is confronted by the three surviving vigilante cops in the garage of his apartment who make him an offer to join their organization of killing criminals. Harry responds: ""I'm afraid you've misjudged me"". The three vigilante cops then leave.Harry discovers and defuses a bomb in his mailbox apparently left by the vigilantes in case he refused their offer, but a second bomb kills Early. Briggs arrives and asks Callahan to drive to police headquarters with the bomb. But in the car Briggs draws his .357 Magnum Smith & Wesson Model 19 snub nose revolver and forces the inspector to disarm. Briggs reveals himself as the leader of the death squad, cites the traditions of frontier justice and summary executions, and says, ""You're a great cop, Harry... but you'd rather stick with the system."" Callahan responds, ""I hate the goddamn system! But until someone comes along with some changes that make sense, I'll stick with it."" Briggs then instructs Harry to get off at the next exit, and as Harry looks in the rear-view mirror he sees Grimes following them. Instantly Harry knows he's been set up.Harry overpowers Briggs and knocks him unconscious, then dumps Briggs out of the car at a shipyard. He then kills the pursuing Grimes by hitting him head-on with his car. He runs onto an old aircraft carrier as the remaining two vigilante cops arrive. The unarmed Harry evades his pursuers and beats Astrachan to death in one of the abandoned ship's hallways, then takes his motorcycle with Davis in pursuit. After a series of daring jumps on the carrier, the two cyclists run out of deck space; Harry is able to stop, but Davis is unable to stop in time, and rides straight off the carrier deck and into the water, where he drowns. Harry looks down at Davis's body floating in the water and contemptuously says, ""Briggs was right. You guys don't have enough experience"".As Harry stumbles back to his damaged car, Briggs appears again, his .38 snub nose aimed squarely at Harry. The crooked Lieutenant menaces the inspector and threatens to prosecute Harry for killing fellow cops. Harry stealthily activates the timer on the mail bomb as Briggs gets into the car and drives off. The bomb explodes before Briggs has driven 100 feet, killing the corrupt Lieutenant. The final scene of the movie is a close-up of Harry's face as he again says the movie's famous tagline: ""A man's got to know his limitations"", before he walks away."

The donors mostly are rich black supporters of Congressman Aubrey Hale Clayton who intends to run for state governorship. After the armed robbery, the criminals disappear in a white getaway van.

The two cops work well together and start getting some leads but their potential witnesses are killed before they can talk to the investigators. Eventually, the trail leads to a high-price black call girl, Roby Harris, and her pimp-lover Ferdy Sloan. Also, the police finds the mutilated body of a man in a trunk.

Joseph Rearden (Paul Newman) takes the fall for a robbery and winds up in the Scrubs. From there, he escapes in the company of a convicted spy and is taken to a remote manor at an unknown location where he is kept isolated.

Rearden robs a postman of a diamond shipment and allows himself to be caught and sentenced to twenty years in Chelmsford Prison, where he becomes acquainted with Slade (Ian Bannen), a notorious traitor serving a life term. Recruited by an organization that arranges escapes for high profile prisoners in exchange for half of their hidden loot, Rearden, along with Slade, soon finds himself out of jail and in a safe house in Ireland.

Reardon is aided by Mrs. Smith, who reveals herself to be Mackintosh''s daughter, They both pursues Slade to Malta, where they hope to expose Wheeler for the traitor he is.—duke1029 Joseph Rearden (Paul Newman) is going undercover for the British Secret Service. The only people who know about the undercover work are Rearden's Director, Angus Mackintosh (Harry Andrews), who he trusts implicitly, and Mackintosh's assistant, Mrs. Smith (Dominique Sanda). The set-up: Rearden, posing as an Australian tourist in Britain, will be caught and convicted of a one hundred forty thousand pound sterling diamond theft, the jewels, which are never recovered (since Rearden will pass them on to Mrs. Smith and Mackintosh). The ""on the surface"" plan is for Rearden to infiltrate a group known as the Scarperers, who assist long term inmates escape, the unrecovered diamonds as the financial bait. Things do not go quite according to plan, with a leak somewhere in the informational chain as Mackintosh and Mrs. Smith are supposedly the only people who know officially what's going on. However, in reaching the true end goal, Rearden is unaware of a second plan concerning Mackintosh and longtime Conservative Member of the British Parliament, Sir George Wheeler (James Mason), who is best known for his frequent political diatribes on the British government not doing enough to protect itself from foreign threats.—Huggo Joseph Rearden (Paul Newman), a British Intelligence agent, arrives in London and makes a rendezvous with Mackintosh (Harry Andrews), the head of his organization, in a discreet office located just off Trafalgar Square. Mackintosh and his deputy, Mrs Smith (Dominique Sanda), inform him of a simple way to steal diamonds which are transported via the postal service to avoid attention. This he does, apparently getting successfully away after punching a postman, and making off with the diamond-filled parcel. However, that evening, in his hotel room he is paid a visit by two Metropolitan Police detectives who have received an anonymous phone call advising them about the robbery. They are unconvinced by Rearden's pretense to be an innocent Australian who has recently arrived in London.The judge (Roland Culver) at his trial is angered by the failure to recover the stolen diamonds from Rearden, who he believes has stashed them away somewhere, and sentences him to 20 years in jail. Rearden is shipped off to HM Prison Chelmsford. He slowly begins to blend in with the other prisoners, and is assigned to laundry-washing duties. A few days after entering he encounters Slade (Ian Bannen), a former British intelligence officer kept in high security after having been exposed as a KGB mole. He makes innocent inquiries of his fellow inmates about Slade, but not a great deal is known about him.A few weeks later, he is approached by a well-spoken inmate who offers to act as a go-between with an organization which can spring him from the prison in exchange for a large cut of the stolen diamonds. They are used to helping prisoners escape, and have another exit planned shortly, which he can join, if he is prepared to put up the money, to which he agrees. Two days later a diversion is arranged, and smoke bombs are hurled over the walls. Using the smoke screen Rearden and a fellow prisoner, who turns out to be Slade, are lifted over the walls by a cargo net and driven away at high speed. They are then drugged by injection, and taken to a secret location, somewhere in wild, deserted countryside. When Slade and Rearden awake, they are told they will be kept there for a week until the hunt for them dies down.In London, Mackintosh discreetly monitors the progress of Rearden. His entry into prison has been a planned sting operation to smoke out the organization. It is now intended they will be raided, rounded up and Slade returned to prison. Following a speech attacking the handling of the Slade escape by an old friend and war comrade, Sir George Wheeler MP (James Mason) in the House of Commons, Mackintosh approaches him and advises him it would be better to remain silent or risk embarrassing himself. Wheeler, however, despite masquerading as a staunchly patriotic right-winger, is actually a Communist and an agent of the KGB. He immediately tips off the head of the organization where Rearden is being held. Mackintosh had suspected Wheeler and had used their meeting to try to flush him out. Before Mackintosh can act, he is run down by a car and dies soon afterwards.In the meantime, Rearden falls under suspicion by the escape organization. Doubting his claims to be an Australian criminal, they beat him violently and savage him with a guard dog. Eventually, he manages to fight back and escape the building, setting it on fire. He makes out across country, pursued by his guards and the dog. He is finally forced to drown the dog in a stream to throw his assailants off the scent. He then makes it to a nearby town, where he discovers he is on the west coast of Ireland and has apparently been staying on the estate of a close friend of Sir George Wheeler. He contacts Mrs Smith in London, who flies to meet him in Galway. Realising that Slade has been smuggled out of Ireland on the private yacht of Wheeler, they now head to Valletta, Malta, where Wheeler is heading.Once in Malta, they try to infiltrate one of Wheeler's parties and discover the whereabouts of Slade. Wheeler soon recognizes Mrs Smith - the daughter of his old friend Mackintosh - drugs her, and takes her aboard his yacht. Rearden tries to get the Maltese police to raid the boat, but they refuse to believe that a respected man as Wheeler can be involved in kidnapping and treason, so instead they move to arrest Rearden, who is still a wanted man for his earlier faked diamond robbery. So, Rearden is again forced to flee, but manages to follow Wheeler to a church where he and Slade are holding Mrs Smith. He pulls a gun on them, and orders them to hand over Mrs Smith. Presented with a Mexican standoff, Wheeler and Slade try to persuade Rearden to let them go unharmed, in return for which they will also spare him and Mrs Smith. Reluctantly Rearden agrees, but Mrs Smith takes up a gun and shoots Slade and Wheeler, avenging the murder of her father. She has fulfilled her orders and bitterly abandons Rearden, angry at the way he has not followed his own orders to kill Slade."

Meadows is not much of a thief. Indeed, in his late teens, he is not much of a man at all. His great crime was to try to steal forty dollars from the admiral's wife's pet charity. For this, he's been sentenced to eight years behind bars. At first, Buddusky and Mulhall view the journey as a paid vacation, but their holiday spirits are quickly depressed by the prisoner, who looks prepared to break into tears at any moment.

That prisoner is eighteen year old seaman Larry Meadows, who has received a dishonorable discharge and an eight year prison sentence for the $40 theft of a charity box. The severity of the sentence is because the polio charity is the high profile pet project of the commanding officer's wife. They have to get Meadows to Portsmouth in five days, a trip they can accomplish in two. As such, Badass suggests to Mule that they milk the system by taking the five days, collecting on the per diems, and whooping it up on their way back to Norfolk with that per diem money in hand. The focus of their trip changes when they learn of the harshness of the sentence in relation to the crime, and after they meet Meadows, who they can see is an inexperienced, naive, somewhat simple and trustworthy boy whose young adulthood will be taken away from him. So, they decide to take the handcuffs off and give Meadows those adult experiences in the next five days that he has so far not had in his short adult life, as well as allow him to get some closure regarding issues in his personal life. They get into one misadventure after another en route.

Sinbad narrowly escapes into the city, where the city guard forces the hostile stranger to flee. Soon, Sinbad encounters the Grand Vizier of Marabia (Douglas Wilmer). The Vizier, who wears a golden mask to hide his disfigured face, says that Sinbad's amulet is actually one piece of a puzzle; the Vizier has another. The Vizier relates to Sinbad a legend that the three pieces, when joined together, will reveal a map showing the way to the Fountain of Destiny, hidden somewhere on the lost continent of Lemuria. The legend tells that he who bears the three pieces of the puzzle to the fountain will receive ""youth, a shield of darkness, and a crown of untold riches.""Sinbad agrees to help the Vizier find the fountain.

However, he is slain in a sword duel by Sinbad, who then takes the ""crown of untold riches"" that rises out of the fountain (but not before a vision appears in the water showing it on Sinbad's head) and gives it to the Grand Vizier (later, Sinbad explains to Margiana when she asks him why he refused the crown that he values freedom, and a king is never really free).

His still frozen body is found in 2173, and unfrozen by scientists Drs. Melik and Orva. In unfreezing Miles, the doctors have committed an illegal act in what is now a totalitarian police state, where records of the past have been destroyed and the resulting history unknown. The society is filled primarily of conformists who look to the state's ""leader"" for guidance. The doctors, working with an underground group of revolutionaries based in what is called the Western District, ask Miles to help the revolutionaries infiltrate the state's secret and highly important Aires project. Their rationale is that Miles does not exist in the eyes of the state and thus if captured cannot provide any information to them. In Miles' reluctant journey to the Western District, he co-opts the initially unwilling assistance of one of the conformists, poet Luna Schlosser, in trying both to reach the Western District and avoid capture by the police. As a non-political person who believes that all leaders are self-interested, Miles - even after learning the nature of the Aires project - has the primary goals of staying alive and getting the girl, as he is starting to fall in love with Luna, who may have her own thoughts about love and life in this society.—Huggo A shy and awkward New York health food store owner, Miles Munroe, is cryogenically frozen and is awakened some 200 years in the future.

The doctors hide the illegally defrosted Miles at Dr. Melik's house, marveling at his quaint requests for organic foods and his ignorance of the health benefits of steak, deep-fried foods and hot fudge.Soon, the doctors ask Miles to help them learn about the Aries Project, which they suspect is The Leader's plot to destroy their revolutionary movement, adding that Miles's brain will be reprogrammed if his identity is revealed. Just as Miles declines to participate, security police swarm, enabling him to escape as the doctors are captured.Hiding in a nearby van full of robots, Miles uses spare parts to disguise himself as one of them and is delivered to the home of poet Luna Schlosser (Diane Keaton), who is disappointed by her new servant's facial features, but needs help for a party that evening. Instructed by Luna to prepare food for her guests, Miles spoons instant pudding powder into a bowl, immediately producing a viscous mass, which is enveloping the counter as the doorbell sounds. After accidentally incinerating the guests' wraps, Miles struggles with the rampaging pudding in the kitchen, beating it into submission with a broom while Luna and her artist friends become intoxicated from passing around an orb (a synthetic marijuana orb that can be absorbed through one's bare skin).After the party, Luna and her painter friend Herald enter the orgasmatron, a device which simulates sex.

When Miles forces Luna to accompany him to a house where he asks to borrow a car, Luna contacts the police, who instruct her to detain the alien. Borrowing their host's inflatable hydrovac suit, Luna convinces Miles to wear it as a disguise, then drives to a deserted road near a river where she inflates the suit in order to disable Miles as the police approach.

Running to the river, Luna climbs onto the buoyant Miles, paddling until the police fire a shot into his suit, propelling them to the other side. There, Miles finds an abandoned 20th century era Volkswagon, which starts immediately. As they drive away, Luna asks what it is like to be dead for 200 years, to which Miles replies it is ""like a weekend in Beverly Hills"". Luna doesn't understand.Miles and Luna take refuge in Dr. Melik's deserted house where Luna suggests they use the orgasmatron, but Miles tries to win her over to more primitive ways of making love. Interrupted by the police, Miles gives Luna Dr. Melik's gun, telling her to hide until he can lead them to the western district where they will find out about the Aries Project. Miles is hiding in the orgasmatron when the police find him disheveled and grinning like a zombie. They lead him away, then later, he wakes up in a drawer and is informed that he will be initiated into a society that will completely take care of his needs and desires. After being reprogrammed, fitted with new clothes and moved into a new apartment, complete with a robot dog named Rags, Miles is soon working at a new job and dating a pretty co-worker.Now living alone in the woods, Luna is captured by handsome, blond Erno Windt , a leader with the underground, and becomes a revolutionary. After dinner at McDonalds one night, Miles is surprised at home by Luna, whom he does not remember and, horrified to learn that she is with the underground, he calls for Rags to attack as Erno jumps out of the orgasmatron. Captured and taken to the woods, Miles is reprogrammed again. After regaining his original personality and memory, Miles is attracted to Luna, but sadly realizes she is involved with Erno. Agreeing to help with Erno's plan for Aries Day, Miles and Luna infiltrate a medical facility disguised as doctors, and as Miles jealously bickers with Luna over her feelings for Erno, they are surprised by a team of physicians who mistake them for expected guests.Entering a top- secret meeting, they all learn that an assassin's bomb has destroyed The Leader, except for his nose, which now must be cloned. Miles and Luna determine to create a diversion and steal the nose, but instead, find themselves in an operating theater with the doctors ready to observe them performing the procedure. After stalling as long as they can, Miles hides the nose under his surgical mask, but it is quickly discovered. Miles holds the nose hostage with Dr. Melik's gun while he and Luna run off, then ultimately throws it under a steamroller where it is flattened, to the horror of the doctors and police.Having successfully escaped, Luna ecstatically proclaims that Erno's revolution will soon triumph, but Miles retorts that political solutions never work, adding that in six months, someone will be stealing Erno's nose. Agreeing that they love each other, Luna ruefully informs Miles that science has proven meaningful relationships cannot last. When Miles refutes the theory, she observes that he does not believe in science, political systems or God and asks what he does believe in. Miles answers that he believes in sex and death, two things that come once in a lifetime, but after death one is not nauseous. Finally, Miles and Luna kiss."

She lives with her seventeen year old daughter Trina Stanley, and her mother, Maud Ericson, who acts more the teenager than Trina.

Ann's uptight attitude seems to have softened slightly ever since returning from a trip to Greece with Maud. What she has not told anyone is that her softened attitude is from a romantic one night only liaison with a young American man she met by happenstance by an out of the way Greek beach, he who tried to get her to be more carefree, if only for that one night. Purely by coincidence, she meets that man again in New York. He is twenty-two year old Peter Latham, a steel heir who is an acquaintance of Trina's. While Ann's family and friends encourage her to pursue a relationship with a wealthy southern gentleman client named J.D. Rogers, Peter pursues Ann behind the scenes, while Maud believes Peter wants to court Trina. Peter is falling in love with Ann. Although she admits she is flattered by Peter's declaration, Ann may not be able to get over the difference in their ages, regardless of what she may be feeling about him.

By todays standard, ullman would have just been passed of as silly sex starved cougar and the young male( albert) a stupid eye candy figure head.

Buddy, Barilli, Mingo and Ansel, detectives with the NYPD, comprise a secret investigative unit called the Seven-Ups, who, largely undercover, focus on cases leading to felony convictions with prison sentences of seven years or more for the criminals in question. Many within the NYPD who know about the unit don't support the idea of it because of the often unethical way they work on the cases, but their superior, Inspector Gilson, defends the unit solely because of the results. On the sly, Buddy, who is the head of the team, gets much of the information for the cases from Vito Lucia, a childhood friend who still lives and works in the old neighborhood where much of the crime is based. Vito knows that his life could be in danger if the mob finds out that he acts as a snitch for the police. After Buddy starts looking into the loan sharking business of some local mob members, unknown to him some of those mob members are shaken down for a minimum $100,000 apiece, one by one kidnapped for ransom before they are released when the extortionists are able to abscond with the ransom money. The M.O. of the extortionists is for two to act as police detectives bringing the mob member in for questioning, before showing their true colors of kidnapping the person for ransom. The mob has no reason to doubt that the men truly are NYPD gone bad. Buddy even sees one of them taken in, a bail bondsman named Festa with mob ties, he knowing that what he witnessed was not what it appeared on the surface, however unaware that this situation was not a one off in the scuttlebutt he had previous heard about general unrest on the streets. By the time that Buddy learns of the serial kidnappings and the unofficial war the mob has with the NYPD because of it, Buddy and the team are determined to nab the mastermind behind the extortions as it has become more than a professional issue for them.—Huggo New York City cops wage a war against assorted hoods and criminals after one of their own is brutally killed by a hoodlum.

However, what one of the detectives doesn't know is that one of his informants is mastermind of a plot to kidnap loan sharks. The kidnappers get to their victims by impersonating police officers. While investigating one of the disappearances, one of the seven-ups gets spotted and is killed. The situation puts the seven-ups in a precarious position because it looks like they are tied to the kidnappings. So now one detective has to find the murderers and clear the seven-ups' soiled reputation.—jgp3553@yahoo.com A sting takes place at an antique store that is a front for laundering counterfeit money. It is the latest success of The Seven-Ups, a squad of undercover NY policemen whose collars regularly get sentences of seven years or up. Two mobsters are presently in the squad's sights - Max Kalish, a businessman, and Festa, a bail bondsman. However, Buddy Manuchi, the Seven-Ups' leader, gets wind of strange and violent happenings within the mob, unaware that Max Kalish was kidnapped and held until payment of a huge ransom, and now he and other mobsters are in panic mode. Things then go from bad to worse for both The Seven-Ups and Kalish's mob when one the the squad's members is found out and tied up in a car trunk, only to see the real kidnappers grab Cotello, one of Kalish's partners, and blast him and the helpless undercover cop. When Buddy arrives on the scene, the real killers flee, and a mad car chase through the streets of New York blasts onto the country freeway and ends in a savage crash into the underside of a crippled 18-wheeler. The Seven-Ups now probe to find out who is kidnapping mobsters to find the killers of their partner, and Buddy suddenly realizes they have a police mole working for them.—Michael Daly New York City circa 1973. A business type enters an antique store as a heavily bearded type is shown upstairs by one of the store's owners. A burly deliveryman with a glass water cooler bottle enters and trips over the businessman, smashing up several antiques. A loud argument ensues and uniformed police must intervene - until a painter breaks into the office upstairs and returns with a box wrapped in grocery paper - and containing large wads of counterfeit money.Thus has The Seven-Ups - a special unit led by Buddy Manucci (Roy Scheider) and including Officers Ansel (Ken Kercheval) (the phony painter), Barelli (Victor Arnold), and Mingo (Jerry Leon) (the phony deliveryman) - broken up another area of criminal activity. But their unorthodox methods upset Lt. Jerry Hanes (Robert Burr), who has confronted the team's commanding officer Inspector Gilson (Rex Everett) before about their methods only for Gilson to fully stand up for his men. The controversy upsets Manucci, though he is reassured by his CO's endorsement.Presently the team is gathering information on a crooked bail bondsman, Festa (Matt Russo), as his name has turned up on a wiretap. Buddy consults one of his Mob informants, funeral parlor owner Vito Lucia (Tony Lo Blanco), who presently does not have any new information to give.Later mobster Max Kalish (Larry Haines) is arrested at his plush mansion by two FBI agents - but they are not FBI agents as they corner Kalish, punch him out, then demand a hefty ransom from Kalish's lawyer. The lawyer and a mob errand boy drive to a car wash where the phony G-men lock the car's doors and steal the ransom; they later dump Kalish in a vacant lot and drive off, and at a museum Moon (Richard Lynch), the longish-haired younger of the two kidnappers, meets his connection where money changes hands for the successful kidnapping.While walking through his old neighborhood Buddy is summoned by a barber, who tells him of disturbing activity within the area's mafia gang. Buddy and Ansel then become more concerned when they are tailing Festa and he is grabbed by two men (the same gunmen who grabbed Kalish) who portray themselves as members of the District Atorney's office. Buddy and the team then stake out Vito's funeral parlor, where Kalish and other criminals are meeting to decide what to do next; the kidnappers of Festa have already collected several hefty ransoms and want another for Festa, to be exchanged at the same car wash. The mobsters' anxiety shows when a bodyguard starts to whip out a revolver on Vito when he appears. Ansel has infiltrated the ranks of mobsters' limo drivers wearing a wire - but while Buddy and the others are momentarily distracted one of the bodyguards notices the wire. Ansel is taken inside, beaten, and his cover blown.Kalish, thinking the kidnappers are cops, ties up and gags Ansel and stuff him into the trunk of his fellow criminal Carmine Coltello (Lou Polan), who will drive to the car wash with a tail of gunmen to deal with the kidnappers. When Mingo sees Ansel is not among the limo drivers, Buddy and Borelli jump in their car and follow Coltello to the car wash. Once there, with the mobsters on one side thinking they will catch the kidnappers there, Coltello instead is jumped just outside the other side of the car wash and driven into a next door parking garage. Buddy and Borelli try to get into the place, but only after hearing gunfire - the result when the kidnappers Moon and his driver Bo think it's a setup and gun down Coltello, then blast open the trunk of his car, and are shocked to find a now-dead policeman inside - do they succeed in entering the garage. They arrest the garage worker, Toredano (Joe Spinell) before discovering Ansel's body.The gunmen then make a break for it and Buddy jumps into his car and a violent high-speed pursuit ensues through the streets of New York City before blasting through a police roadblock onto a mammoth bridge then spilling onto a country highway. Buddy finally catches up to the gunmen but his rammed into the underside of a stricken eighteen-wheeler, and narrowly avoids being decapitated by the truck's rear bumper.Escaping major injury, Buddy goes with Borelli to the hospital where Coltello is being treated for critical injuries and the body of Ansel has been posted. Buddy is then interrogated by Gilson and Hanes and it is here he learns of the kidnapping of mafia types - and that the Chief Of Detectives (at present involved in a stormy snap press conference with reporters naturally confused and suspicious about the whole matter) believes it to be The Seven-Ups' work.Vito, meanwhile, is shaken badly by the disastrous turnabout in the Coltello incident, and he confronts Moon telling him to release Festa and lay low. Moon, though, wants none of it, vowing to kill Manucci if he comes calling.Despite Gilson's orders, Buddy, Barilli and Mingo question Toredano on their own, but, having been physically grilled by the police before to no avail, Toredano provides no information. Frustrated by Toredano's silence, Buddy returns to the hospital where he threatens to remove Coltello's oxygen unless he reveals who shot Ansel. Although surprised when Coltello manages to mutter Kalish's name, Buddy and the others go to Kalish's house and at gunpoint demand an explanation. When Kalish details the ransom kidnappings and mentions his circle of mob colleagues who have been affected, Buddy writes down their names. Later at a diner he compares the list to that of the mob bosses Vito has informed upon and suddenly realizes the connection.Later that night, Buddy summons an anxious Vito for a meeting and asks for information on Toredano. The next morning, Buddy, Barilli and Mingo arrive at Toredano's dilapidated house. After locking Toredano in the cupboard, Buddy waits inside while Barilli and Mingo hide outside. Soon, Moon and Bo arrive, but Bo spots Barilli and the men shoot each other. Alerted, Moon races away with Buddy in pursuit as Mingo looks after the wounded Barilli. After a chase on foot, Buddy confronts and kills Moon.That afternoon, Buddy meets Vito and reveals he knows about his betrayal. Insisting that he never did anything to hurt Buddy directly, Vito refuses to accept responsibility for Ansel's death, declaring he had to get money to support his wife and children. Disgusted, Buddy assures Vito he will not arrest him, but will make sure the mob bosses know Vito was behind the kidnappings. Horrified, Vito pleads for Buddy's forgiveness, but the detective walks away."
The Day of the Dolphin,1973,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0069946/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A marine biologist teaches his dolphins to communicate in English but shady characters plan to kidnap the trained mammals for a more sinister purpose. Dr Jake Terrell, who has been training a pair of dolphins for many years, has had a breakthrough. He has taught his dolphins to speak and understand English, although they do have a limited vocabulary. When the dolphins are stolen, he discovers they're to be used in an assassination attempt. Now he is in a race to discover who is the target, and where the dolphins are, before the attempt is carried out.—Brian W Martz <B.Martz@Genie.com> Zoologist and behavioral psychologist Dr. Jake Terrell and his team, which includes his wife, Maggie Anderson Terrell, are funded by the Franklin Foundation to conduct research with dolphins, namely to learn why they do the things they do. Their primary subject is a dolphin named Alpha - Pha for short - who was born at their research facility four years ago, and who the team raised after Pha's mother died. What Harold DeMilo, Jake's primary liaison at the Foundation, is unaware of, as is the rest of the world, but what Jake eventually divulges to DeMilo when he threatens to pull funding, is that Jake and Maggie's primary work is teaching Pha how to communicate in English. DeMilo vows to keep this information confidential as the Terrells are afraid of the outside world trying to exploit Pha. This work has stalled of late, with Pha refusing to speak, they believe because he has reached his sexual maturity. As such, they introduce a female dolphin named Beta, or Bea for short, to the research. It does more than the trick as Pha not only begins to communicate in English again, but also teaches Bea. Much to Jake's chagrin, DeMilo sends an ""old friend"" named Curtis Mahoney to the facility for a tour. What Jake and the team is unaware of is that Mahoney, who is not an old friend, blackmailed DeMilo to gain access. The team learns from DeMilo that Mahoney, out of that tour, is aware of the research and is threatening to go public. The Terrells figure they have to take preemptive action. However, what is happening with Mahoney is not all it appears on the surface, and involves a plot, indeed exploiting the dolphins, for a much more nefarious reason. When the Terrells learn what is happening, they not only try to foil the plot, but also have to make the difficult decision of what to do with Pha and Bea, which in turn may risk their research.—Huggo"

Serious, hard-working student James T. Hart faces the rigors of his first year at Harvard Law School. The pressure to succeed is tremendous and some of the students form study groups while also spending a great many hours studying. Hart's greatest challenge is contract law and his professor, Charles W. Kingsfield Jr. Using the Socratic method, Kingsfield challenges his students with questions demanding accuracy and creativity in their responses and often humiliating those who are unable to respond. As the school year progresses, Hart faces many challenges but befriends Susan Fields - unaware that she has a connection that affects their relationship. Finally, Hart accommodates himself to whatever might come his way, accepting a new set of priorities in his life.—garykmcd The trials and tribulations of a group of first year students at Harvard Law School. Focuses on one student in particular, James Hart (played by Timothy Bottoms). He immediately finds himself out of his depth, particularly in Contract Law where the teacher is a curmudgeonly, stern man who has taught the subject for 40 years, Professor Kingsfield (John Houseman). However, through hard work he starts to cope. Then he starts a relationship with Susan (Lindsay Wagner) and it is soon apparent that he may have to choose between her and passing his courses. To make matters worse, she's the professor's daughter.—grantss James T. Hart is just entering his first year as a Harvard law student. Being a Midwesterner from Minnesota already makes him atypical from the Harvard stereotype. But typical of many of his fellow first year classmates, he is asked to join a study group, which ends up being six disparate individuals who may not be compatible beyond the fact that they are all aiming for success in their law studies which they equate with success in their future professional life. Although given a head's up by a colleague back in Minnesota, Hart is nonetheless ill-prepared for the reality that is the Contract Law class taught by the irascible and demanding Professor Charles W. Kingsfield, Jr. Beyond being academically bright, Hart also demonstrates that he has some level of street smarts in the deduction he makes in how to add a little extra insurance in how to obtain that elusive good grade in Kingsfield's class, if only there are enough hours in the day to obtain that continued level of insurance. Those hours are decreased when Hart embarks in a relationship with Susan Fields, a young woman he meets in town in an unusual circumstance. What ends up being their roller coaster of a relationship is largely directed by her unique perspective of what he is going through with law school in general, and Kingsfield's class in particular. As the year progresses, Hart comes to a changing perspective of Kingsfield, where Hart no longer just wants to get a good grade in the class, but also wants Kingsfield's admiration as he begins truly to admire Kingsfield.—Huggo As a first-year law student at Harvard, James Hart knows he's got his work cut out for him. But things get harder than he anticipated when he runs afoul of the school's dreaded contracts professor, Charles W. Kingsfield Jr..

During the first day of class, legendary professor Kingsfield chides him for being unprepared. Unfortunately for the unsuspecting Kinsgfield, this casual snub inspires an imaginary rivalry in Hart's mind, one which carries us through Hart's first year at Harvard and deep inside the mind of an obsessed student.Hart meets other students and forms a study group. They warn him of the stress of studying law under Kingsfield.Walking home from the store one night, Hart meets a girl named Susan who lives near campus. When she goes inside, he lingers in the shadows, watching her through the windows. He feels a strange and inexplicable attraction to her. Susan's attention inspires him to speak aloud in Kingsfield's class, and this ""success"" arouses his libido. Viewing her as a weapon in his intellectual battle with the professor, he returns to her house, once again gazing uninvited into her windows before making his presence known. She invites him in, and he wakes her in the middle of the night to rave about Kingsfield and the competition in which they are engaged. She tries to comfort him.His relationship with Susan continues until one morning he is late for class and unprepared. Kingsfield calls on him, and moves on to another student when Hart cannot answer the question. In Hart's mind, this routine practice is a grave insult and was directed at him personally because of their deep animus toward one another. Unable to psychologically cope with this perceived loss, Hart takes it out on Susan, blaming her for his failure and for not ""giving him sustenance."" He repeats this strange totemic phrase until he passes out drunk in the park for hours. When he wakes, Susan is gone. He curses her loudly and swears off women, who only distract from his struggle with the professor.Returning home, he finds that Kingsfield has invited all of the students to a Thanksgiving party. At the party, he discovers that Susan is actually Kingsfield's daughter. He yells at her for not telling him of her connection to his enemy. With disgust, he tells her he doesn't even recognize her in dress-clothes. The viewer wonders why she was so secretive, but realizes that probably she did not tell Hart of her connection sooner out of fear that he might kill her and wear her skin like his own, so desperate is he to be closer to Kingsfield. But Susan is a woman with no personal will, so when Hart realizes that he now has the chance to become even closer to the professor, she takes up with him again. He grins lasciviously at her as he tells her she looks like her father. Both admit that Hart is only with her for this connection.Susan resents her father deeply (her mother ended up in a mental institution) and makes love with Hart in her father's bed in order to spite him. Hart goes downstairs into the professor's office to gloat over his conquest, this victory over Kingsfield that Hart has won by defiling the man's daughter. He walks the edges of the office in his boxer shorts, swirling a snifter of brandy and basking in the glory of having bested such an important foe. But as Hart stands nearly nude in the library, Kingsfield returns home. Hart's cowardice causes him to flee without his clothes; this shame fuels his insecurity further.He becomes paranoid, convinced that Kingsfield knows what he did. He tells Susan that Kingsfield is out to get him, that Kingsfield cares about him personally. He implies that Kingsfield watches him. He tells her he is inside Kingsfield's mind, that he is three steps ahead of Kingsfield's own thoughts. Susan tries to convince him that her father does not and cannot care who he is, but Hart cannot relinquish his delusions. Hart feels that every oppressive force on earth originates within the great professor. His relationship with Susan withers, as Hart is completely consumed by thoughts of her father. But Susan discovers Hart hiding in the shadows outside her house; he cannot let go of his only real connection with the professor.He breaks into a library vault to view Kingsfield's notes from his time as a student, to reassure himself that Kingsfield is no better than him. He scoffs at them, but later, lying in bed, begins drawing symbols he saw doodled in the margin of Kingsfield's notes on the walls of his bedroom.Hart begins reading every article or book Kingsfield ever published, trying to use them against Kingsfield in class discussions. Kingsfield mistakes this fixated combativeness for flattery and offers Hart a work assignment, but because of his bizarre obsession and eagerness to both please and defeat Kingsfield, Hart is unable to complete the task on time. Hart takes his failure so hard that he accosts Susan in a grocery store, blaming her and her father for his terrible insomnia and lack of appetite. Susan encourages him to stand up to her father, not understanding what this could mean for them all.In class the next day, Hart once again fumbles when Kingsfield asks him a question. Kingsfield then tells Hart to call his parents to come pick him up, as he will never make it through law school. Hart retorts and calls Kingsfield a son-of-a-bitch, upon which Kingsfield says, ""Mr. Hart, that is the most intelligent thing you have said all morning. You may take your seat"".Hart and a classmate check into a hotel. They are shown surrounded by trash, both in their underpants, muttering about Kingsfield's course. They return to school for exams. After the test, Kingsfield gets onto an elevator alone with Hart. In a pathetic turn, Hart attempts to express to Kingsfield how much he personally means to him, but Kingsfield does not even know Hart's name.When Hart's grades arrive, he gleefully folds the envelope into an airplane and throws it into the ocean, seemingly uncaring of what the envelope signifies."

A short Arizona motorcycle cop gets his wish and is promoted to Homicide following the mysterious murder of a hermit. He is forced to confront his illusions about himself and those around him in order to solve the case, eventually returning to solitude in the desert.—Martin H. Booda <booda@datasync.com> Ambitious but diminutive motorcycle cop John Wintergreen (Robert Blake) patrols the Arizona highways, yearning for promotion to the homicide division. Thanks to his revelation that a supposed suicide is actually a murder, his wish it granted. But good cop Wintergreen is about to discover that street-smarts and integrity can have lethal consequences as he finds himself sinking into a mire of workplace politics and corruption - not to mention a very tricky love-triangle. The tension between a lonely policemen and the journeymen of the counter culture provides the subtext, and the stunning martian look of the Arizona mesa the backdrop, of a brilliant and influential debut feature by musician James William Guercio; the film is the missing link between The Searchers and No Country for Old Men. John Wintergreen is a diminutive motorcycle cop working the lonely highways of Arizona in the mid seventies. He works alone, but occasionally hooks up with his pal ""Zipper."" Wintergreen is conscientious and friendly, whereas Zipper is bored and argumentative, often holing up off the highway to read comic books rather than out on the road . Wintergreen is a Native American and has ambitions to be a detective. So when Zipper and Wintergreen find a delirious and disoriented elderly man wandering in the desert, the trail of how he got there leads back to a deserted shack. Inside is the body of a man who has committed suicide with a shotgun. Wintergreen airs his suspicions about the death, first to the coroner who is keen not to get involved, and then to Harve Poole, an Arizona detective. Harve believes John Wintergreen's suspicions are right and takes him under his wing as his driver and protege. This seems like the break Wintergreen needs to leave the big Harley police bike behind and to walk tall as a detective, in fresh duds, boots and a stetson, dispensing wisdom. But tensions between the two mount over cocktail waitress Jolene, and in differences of opinion over the murder, especially over some missing money, some hidden drugs and the suspected involvement of outlaw hippy bikers, whom Harve is keen to bust. Wintergreen's own run-ins with the hippies on their way to and from California were mostly friendly. Some of his colleagues in the Highway Patrol, however, believe they are in a running battle with disrespectful, drug running, proto-terrorists. John is caught in the nexus of his loyalty to the police force, his ambitions to be detective, his companion'ss distrust of the hippies, Harve's domineering style, Zipper's recidivism, Jolene's manipulation, his sense of responsibility and his own easygoing natural empathy with the people he meets. Something has to give. The only thing good-hearted motorcycle cop John Wintergreen (Robert Blake) wants is to become a detective. To wear a big Stetson, smoke fancy cigars and be paid to think. So when he stumbles upon a dead body, he takes the case - and proves he's got the right stuff. But as soon as he's promoted, he finds that the corruption he must tolerate makes his Stetson not fit so well and the cigars not taste so good. Forced to confront his own disillusionment, Wintergreen heads out on his bike, the Electra Glide, and makes another shocking discovery that could cost him his life."

One day, while staring out the window, she witnesses a murder. But does anybody believe her?—Humberto Amador Ellen and John Wheeler have been living in their London home for six months. They have as their current house guest Ellen's best friend, Sarah Cooke, who imminently will be heading to Glasgow for a teaching job and who spends much of her time during the day with her current lover, Barry. Although she is cordial enough to him to his face, Ellen doesn't much like their neighbor, Mr. Appleby, a gardening aficionado who she learns grew up in their house. Ellen has been suffering of late from a nervous condition, including being unable to sleep, for which her doctor, Tony, has been prescribing her tranquilizers. When she does sleep, she is having recurring nightmares of the horrific automobile accident that killed her first husband, Carl, and the young woman with who he was having an affair. On one of those stormy nights she is unable to sleep, Ellen is certain she sees a dead body of a man in the closed up house across the way, the owners of the house who she and John have never met in they supposedly having left on an extended trip before Ellen and George moved in. Ellen's certainty of what she saw is in the details, such as the victim's throat being slashed, and he being tall and fair featured, much like Carl. In John telephoning the police, they search the house to find nothing out of the ordinary. In the next few days, others things happen that make Ellen even more certain of what she saw, with her repeated calls to the police, the investigation led by Inspector Walker, making her appear crazy in their eyes. Those calls also start to wear on John and Sarah, who want to be supportive but don't know if they can in what appears to be Ellen's mental breakdown. Is Ellen going crazy or is there something else at play?—Huggo In London, wealthy housewife Ellen Wheeler (Elizabeth Taylor) arrives home with new rose plants and is surprised when her usually reclusive neighbor, Mr. Appleby (Robert Lang), a gardening enthusiast, offers to plant them for her. Appleby adds that his father used to own the Wheelers' house, but now he can only afford to live in the garden flat next door.Later that evening, Ellen and her husband John (Laurence Harvey) dine with Ellen's longtime friend, Sarah Cooke (Billie Whitelaw), who is visiting the Wheelers before going to Scotland to begin a new job. That night, Ellen is wracked by a recurring dream of a car crash that killed her former husband Carl (Kevin Colson) during a rainstorm. Waking in alarm, Ellen goes downstairs as, outside, a thunderstorm rages. When John joins her later and makes concerned inquiries, Ellen asks if they can go away together. Guilty over his long hours as a stockbroker, John evades a direct answer, prompting Ellen to declare that she has lost something in their marriage that she wants back. After John returns upstairs, Ellen stares out the window at an old, abandoned, dilapidated house across the way and, during a lightning flash, screams in horror. Frightened, John rushes to his wife who has collapsed on the floor claiming that she has seen a man with his throat slashed slumped in a chair by the window in the abandoned house.John telephones the police who arrive quickly and search the old house while Ellen, who has been provided with a mild sedative by Sarah, undergoes questioning by Inspector Walker (Bill Dean). Walker's partner, Sergeant Norris (Michael Danvers-Walker) returns later to report that the house is exceedingly run down, but there is no sign of a body. Frustrated and angered by the men's doubt, Ellen insists that she saw a body.The next morning, Ellen views a new row of trees planted by Appleby in his garden and telephones Walker to suggest that the area is the perfect size to cover a body. Meanwhile, unknown to Ellen, Sarah has a rendezvous at a hotel with a man (who is not shown).Later, Walker grudgingly returns to the Wheelers' and questions Appleby, who admits that he planted the trees after the storm, which is an ideal time for planting, but protests the inspector's suggestion that he dig them up. After Walker departs without taking action, Ellen finds a pair of cuff-links and a lighter in her private desk drawer.At his office, John arrives back from his lunch break and after taking a phone call from a client over a latest stock investment, receives a call from Walker who reveals that Ellen has telephoned him numerous times regarding their investigation of the ""murder.""At home that evening, Ellen responds angrily when John recommends that she speak with his physician friend Tony. When John suggests that perhaps it would be best for Ellen to take a trip as she proposed, she reminds him that she wanted them to go away together. Ellen then shows John the cuff-links and lighter, which she says belonged to Carl and which she has not seen in years, and demands to know how they got in her private desk. Offended by her inference that he placed them there, John departs for his local pub for drinks. John meets Sarah on his way out and the two talk quietly, unaware that they are being observed by Ellen.Later that night, Sarah brings Ellen hot cocoa and the women discuss Ellen's frustration that no one will believe her about the body. When Ellen refuses the cocoa, Sarah goes to get her a sleeping pill as Ellen gazes out the window at the old house. Spotting a dim light moving behind the house's ramshackle shutters, Ellen calls Sarah, who confirms seeing the light. Ellen telephones Walker, whose men arrive at the old house as John returns home. Discovering Appleby inside the old house, Walker and Norris take him into custody.The next morning, after digging up the back garden, the police find no body, and are forced to release Appleby without making a charge. Privately, Walker tells John the ""case"" of the murder is officially closed and expresses his hope not to hear from Ellen again. That afternoon, John meets with Tony (Tony Britton), a therapist friend of his, to ask him to see Ellen, but Tony insists that she must be convinced to see him on her own.At the Wheelers' that evening, Sarah admits to seeing her longtime boyfriend Barry, but avoids answering Ellen's question of how Barry will handle her move to Glasgow. When Sarah jokingly says she would rather go somewhere exotic rather than Scotland, Ellen grows distressed. While Sarah and John privately discuss their concern about Ellen in the dining room, they are interrupted by her scream from the living room. There, Ellen declares she has just seen the body of a dead girl in the old house. Dismayed, John telephones Tony. Ellen agrees to speak with him the next day and, during their conversation describes the car accident that killed Carl and his young mistress, whom she never knew. Admitting it was the deepest betrayal of her life, Ellen points out that the unexpected appearance of her former husband's private articles suggests she is purposely being driven into emotional duress. When Tony advises her to leave the house immediately and go to a rest home in Switzerland, Ellen wearily acquiesces. After John refuses to contact Walker, Ellen secretly telephones the inspector to plead for an investigation of the old house. Falsely promising to do so, Walker also suggests Ellen contact the owners and reveals that the house was purchased six months earlier by a private company, named DIPCO.After Ellen has packed for her departure that evening for Switzerland, John presents her with numerous financial papers to sign. Dryly noting the speed with which John had the papers drawn up, Ellen nevertheless signs them then is startled to notice that one of the companies in which the Wheelers own joint shares is DIPCO. When she asks John about the company, John claims not to remember purchasing any stock from it. Sarah joins the couple, and abruptly Ellen declares that she has discovered Sarah is going to Bermuda, not Glasgow after finding a plane ticket while searching though Sarah's purse. Embarrassed, Sarah admits she gave up the job to go to Bermuda with Barry, of whom she believes Ellen does not approve. Unappeased, Ellen shrilly accuses Sarah and John of having an affair, revealing that she has had Sarah followed. Turning on her husband, Ellen shows him one of his keys, which says DIPCO, and insists that he purchased the house to torment her. Both John and Sarah deny they are involved and continue to insists that Ellen is just imagining things. When John refuses Ellen's challenge to test the key on the door of the old house, Ellen runs out into the storm to the decrepit house. Alarmed, John hurries after her as Sarah beseeches him not to go. After some moments, Sarah follows. One of the large knifes from the knife rack in the kitchen is seen missing from its place.In the darkened house, Sarah, John and Ellen roam around the abandoned building looking for each other before Ellen manages to find the second floor room where she claimed to have seen the body. John soon finds her and a struggle ensues in the darkened room. After hearing Ellen scream, Sarah ventures through the maze-like hallways and stairwells of the house where she enters the parlor room on the second floor. Sarah is shocked to find John in a chair facing the window with his throat cut. Moments later, Ellen emerges from the darkness and savagely attacks Sarah, whom she likens to Carl's young mistress years earlier, and brutally kills her too.Sometime later that evening, Ellen contentedly finishes packing, then telephones Walker to plead theatrically with him to investigate the old house after she leaves, as she knows there are two bodies there. Chuckling as she hangs up the receiver, Ellen is startled when Appleby steps out from the next room. Praising her performance with Walker and also her dedication in punishing her unfaithful husband, Appleby assures Ellen that the inspector will not believe him either if he were to report the murders. Smiling, Ellen asks Appleby if he would like to look after his former home in her absence and Appleby happily agrees. She then leaves, while Appleby stands alone in the living room and watches the old house through the window... with John and Sarah's bodies still there... implying that he will bury them in the garden now that the police will not bother coming back to search it again."

Meanwhile, she must decide whether or not have an affair with a young man she's met.—Ed Sutton <esutton@mindspring.com> At a private Swiss medical clinic, middle-aged Barbara Sawyer (Elizabeth Taylor) briefly reconsiders her decision to have plastic surgery to smooth out her puffy, wrinkled features and restore her trim figure. Considering her husband of 30 years, Mark (Henry Fonda), Barbara proceeds with the excruciating procedures (long, difficult to watch scenes of actually plastic surgeries).During the long recovery period, Barbara grows friendly with fellow patient David Carrington (Keith Baxter), a fashion photographer who admits that he has had numerous procedures over the years to maintain the ageless appearance necessary in his field. Although Barbara confesses she does not believe she could endure the experience again, David assures her she will return regularly. As Barbara begins healing, she tells David about Mark and expresses concern that she is unable to contact him at their home just outside of Detroit. When David asks where Mark believes she is, Barbara admits she told him she needed a rest cure, and frets about her dishonesty.As the six-week recovery period ends, Barbara agrees to undertake a regimen of cell treatments and commits to a healthier lifestyle in order to allow the treatments the best possibility of working. Awed by Barbara's restored beauty, David laughs at her matronly wardrobe and gives it to the delighted nurse before taking Barbara shopping.On David's advice, she makes plans to meet Mark at a resort in Cortina, Italy. On the drive to the resort, Barbara picks up two young, stranded Italian men going to the same resort and is pleased when they compliment her looks. With Mark scheduled to arrive on the following weekend, Barbara spends the first days at the resort alone.

Disappointed, Barbara continues her solitary holiday, then telephones her daughter Kate (Margaret Blye), who lives in Paris, to invite her to join her in Cortina. Kate declines and encourages her mother to enjoy her trip.The next night at dinner, the handsome young man, Erich (Helmut Berger), introduces himself and asks to join Barbara. Initially hesitant, Barbara agrees and the couple enjoys a long, amiable meal. When the check arrives, however, Barbara is offended when Erich pointedly ignores it, and after signing for the bill, she departs, irritated.

Determined to lift Barbara's spirits, David takes her to a dance club that evening and the next day photographs her using a ski race as the background.At a private party the next night, Barbara notices Erich, whom David describes as a failed competitive skier.

At the airport, Barbara welcomes Kate, who responds enthusiastically to her mother's rejuvenated looks.At lunch, Barbara reassures Kate that she is not depressed and has made friends at the resort. Applauding her mother's uncharacteristic display of independence, Kate then reveals she learned from Mark about a longtime affair he has had with a younger woman, whom he wishes to marry. Unhappy that Mark has revealed this to Kate, Barbara admits she has never loved anyone but Mark and although she thought of sleeping with Erich, she felt nothing for him.

The next morning, Barbara shyly admits she has not had sex in a very long time, which amazes Erich. When Barbara asks if he cares for her, Erich tells her that she is married and clearly still in love with her husband.

After looking around the room and finding no one or any belongings, the killer then locks the bedroom door, with Jane still inside and leaves the key in the door. The killer then finds Jane's slippers on the steps, but he instinctively picks them up and throws them onto a bathroom floor. Jane is now locked in her own room while the killer goes back downstairs to resume sawing up Katia and Dani's dead bodies and leaves with them to bury them in a field a short distance away. When he is finished with burying the bodies of Stefano, Ursula, Katia and Dani, the killer then cleans up the house, washing away the blood and leaves while Jane watches, but she is still locked in her bedroom.At night, the grocery man tries to convince a group of local men that there are four women at the house as opposed to three the men had seen arrive. The killer is nearby and overhears the men. At the same time, Roberto goes to the gas station to get fuel before driving away and sees Jane's car there. The gas station manager tells him that although no one answered the door when he went to drop off Jane's car earlier, he also says that he did not see any of the other women leave.Back at the house, Jane, still locked in her bedroom, slides a newspaper under the door and pushes the key through the keyhole. The key misses the paper, but the killer graciously places the key on the paper for her. When Jane retrieves the key and finally gets the door open, Franz grabs her. Both of them are surprised to see each other and Franz tells Jane that ""he had to do it"", and that the women ""were only dolls"".A flashback shows a young Franz with his brother and a girl, and his brother, wishing to see the girl in an intimate ways, goes for her doll at the edge of a cliff and falls to his death. This made Franz see women who bring nothing but bad things for men. Franz also tells Jane that Flo and Carol seduced him and blackmailed him (they were the three people in the beginning), and they he had to kill Dani because she would have eventually remembered him and his scarf. Franz says he never wanted to hurt Jane, but since she knows that he is the killer, he must kill her to keep his secret intact.Just as Franz begins to strangle Jane with the red and black scarf, Roberto arrives and he and the crazed professor struggle which leads out the front door and into a barn. The struggle leads to the edge of a cliff that the barn sits right beside. Jane stumbles outside and hears someone fall. She watches warily as Roberto returns to her claiming that Franz is dead and the two of them leave to get the police."

Amarcord,1973,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071129/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A series of comedic and nostalgic vignettes set in a 1930s Italian coastal town. One year in a small northern Italian coastal town in the late 1930s is presented. The slightly off-kilter cast of characters are affected by time and location, the social mores dictated largely by Catholicism, and the national fervor surrounding Il Duce akaBenito Mussoliniand Fascism. The stories loosely center on mid-teen Titta and his household, including his adolescent brother, his ever-supportive mother who is always defending him against his father, his freeloading maternal Uncle Lallo, and his paternal grandfather who slyly has eyes and hands for the household maid. Other townsfolk include: town beauty Gradisca, who can probably have any man she wants but generally has none as most think she out of their league; Volpina, the prostitute; Giudizio, the historian; a blind accordionist; and an extremely buxom tobacconist. The several vignettes presented include: the town bonfire in celebration of spring; life at Titta's school with his classmates and teachers; Titta's father Aurelio at his beachfront construction worksite and his and his workmates' encounter with Volpina; Titta's confessions to the priest about his burgeoning sexuality; Aurelio being questioned by authorities about his anti-Fascist leanings; a fantasy sequence at the luxurious Grand Hotel; a family outing with Aurelio's institutionalized brother Teo; many townsfolk embarking on a sail to witness a marine event passing by their town; an annual car race; Titta's fantasy encounter with the tobacconist after closing hours coming true; events surrounding the big snowfall that year, including a family tragedy; and an event centering on Gradisca and her future.—Huggo As sexually-frustrated young adolescent Titta anxiously awaits the arrival of spring at an Italian seaside town inBenito Mussolini's Fascist Italy, a vivid tapestry of interlacing vignettes unfolds. Over the course of a single year, the wide-eyed childhood curiosity, the exciting emotional experiences, vain obsessions, and fervent but dormant pubescent desires coexist with religion, politics, sex, and love. Pivoting around Titta's loud family, little by little, an ever-changing kaleidoscope of 1930s imagery lures Titta into an entire universe of life-altering moments and undiluted teenage fantasies: the quintessential ingredients of one's undying recollections. Will the town's belle Gradisca ever find what she is looking for? Does the wild blonde temptress Volpina want to settle down? Above all, will the small village's effortlessly tempting tobacconist grant Titta's wish?—Nick Riganas In an Italian seaside town, young Titta (Zanin) gets into trouble with his friends and watches various local eccentrics as they engage in often absurd behavior. Frequently clashing with his stern father and defended by his doting mother, Titta witnesses the actions of a wide range of characters, from his extended family to Fascist loyalists to sensual women, with certain moments shifting into fantastical scenarios."

Jack Beauregard, once the greatest gunslinger of the Old West, only wants to move to Europe and retire in peace, but a young gunfighter, known only as ""Nobody,"" idolizes him and wants to see him go out in a blaze of glory. He arranges for Jack to face the 150-man gang known as The Wild Bunch and earn his place in history.—lonamer Aging gunfighter Jack Beauregard (Henry Fonda), tired of being hounded by people who want to kill him for various reasons, wishes to retire and leave the country for Europe. While he is still trying to come up with the money needed for a ship's passage he encounters a strange and quirky man who just calls himself ""Nobody"" (Terence Hill) and professes to be a fan of Jack.Nobody, who is a formidable gunman in his own right, doesn't like the idea of his hero simply vanishing away silently. He wants the name of Jack Beauregard to become a true legend, written down in the history books, and for this purpose he has dreamed up a conflict of truly epic proportions: pitting Jack alone against the 150-man-strong bandit gang, called ""The Wild Bunch"".Unable to believe that Nobody could be serious, Jack initially views Nobody as yet another rival gunman, who is just out to make a name for himself by killing Jack - but Nobody is indeed quite serious about his plan.The potential for such a conflict exists because of one Mr. Sullivan (Jean Martin), the owner of a worthless mine, through which the Wild Bunch is laundering stolen gold. Jack Beauregard's brother, called the Nevada Kid, used to be co-owner of the mine, until Sullivan killed him. Now Nobody is hoping that Jack will take revenge upon Sullivan, thereby earning the ire of the Wild Bunch.Sullivan himself expects Jack to come gunning for him as well and has already sent goons after Jack to kill him, on previous occasions. Those were foiled by Jack himself on one occasion and by Nobody on another. When Sullivan wants to hire gunmen for another attempt on Jack's life, Nobody pretends to take the job and - after some confrontational banter and gun-play - warns Jack of the ambush waiting for him, helping him dispatch the other two gunmen lurking in hiding.Jack, however, disappoints Nobody and defies Sullivan's expectations; he declines to exact blood vengeance for a brother who, he claims, was just as much of a crook as Sullivan. He merely corners Sullivan and takes off him the money he needs for his passage to Europe, then rides off along the train tracks toward New Orleans, where his ship is anchored.Not to be dissuaded so easily, Nobody absconds with a gold transport train that runs along those same tracks. Jack suddenly finds himself being followed by a slow-moving train that keeps pace with his horse but refuses to let him approach - and the Wild Bunch is thundering toward them from the horizon.Jack realizes that he can't escape the confrontation that Nobody has engineered and settles down, using the embankment of the tracks as cover, to fight off 150 bandits on his own. He remembers that, at an earlier point, he had seen some of the riders load up their saddle bags with dynamite, and is able to use the blinking of their gaudy decorations in the sunlight for aiming. He sets off several great explosions, cutting a huge swath through the bandit gang and reducing their number to a fraction of its former size.When the confrontation settles down to a prolonged gunfight, with both sides hunkered down and shooting from behind cover, Nobody drives the train forward again, between the two opposing sides, and allows Jack to board. Together they drive off toward New Orleans, leaving the remnants of the Wild Bunch behind.Now that Jack Beauregard's name in history is secured by a legendary victory, there is only one thing left to do, before he can leave for Europe: he must appear to die in battle. It turns out that even his strange choice of a name has been part of Nobody's plan for Jack all along - one staged duel in the streets of New Orleans and a public death scene later, the grave of Jack Beauregard bears the epitaph, ""Nobody was faster on the draw.""Jack can board his ship in anonymity and says farewell to Nobody with a letter wishing him luck, now that the remainder of the Wild Bunch and aspiring gunmen looking for fame will be gunning for him instead of Jack, while the old rules of the west are changing around them in modern times. Even as the letter is read in voice-over, Nobody is shown dealing with these threats in his own uniquely quirky style, demonstrating that if anybody can handle himself, it's Nobody."

Slaves and masters dominate the narrative of the faraway world of Ygam. Set around the lifespan of Terr, a minute human shaped Om slave, and pet, of the giant blue alien Draags. Escaping into the wilderness and with a device used for intellectual advancement of the Draags, Terr finds refuge and support from fellow Oms and using the learning tool, he finds that knowledge is power and then sets to use the new found knowledge to revolt against the Draag masters...—muddy Devoted to meditation, the Draags, blue-hued gargantuan humanoids of an elevated state of existence, are the predominant species of the distant planet Ygam. As a result, cruelty drives the intellectual creatures: the gigantic Draags keep the minuscule race of Oms under their thumb, domesticating the enslaved beings for their use as servants or pets. And then Terr, a rebellious Om orphan, escapes captivity under everyone's noses, stealing his masters' immense superhuman knowledge. But with war and systematic extermination threatening the entire planet's social stability, the feral Om colonies prepare to die for their freedom. Now, the future of both races is hanging by a thread, and a question emerges. Are the two species capable of peace, change, and coexistence?—Nick Riganas La Planète sauvage AKA Fantastic Planet is a surrealist story based on the Soviet occupation of Czechoslovakia. Set in a far distant world human beings or ""Oms"" have been domesticated by the gigantic Draags. Wild Oms however are a problem and are exterminated by the dozen. One domesticated Om, Terr, is able to escape his masters with a headset that puts information directly into the brain. Armed now with the Draags technology he leads the Oms in an attempt to make life better for them...But will the deomizing destroy them?—Joseph Chastain <theunopeneddoor@yahoo.com> The film depicts a future in which human beings, known as ""Oms"" (a word play on the French-language word hommes, meaning men), have been brought by the giant Draags to the Draags' home planet, where they are kept as pets (with collars). The Draags are an alien race which is humanoid in shape but a hundred times larger than humans, with blue skin, fan-like earlobes and huge, protruding red eyes. The Draags also live much longer than human beings one Draag week equals a human year. Some Oms are domesticated as pets, but others run wild, and are periodically exterminated. The Draags' treatment of the Oms is ironically contrasted with their high level of technological and spiritual development.The story opens with a woman running, occasionally looking behind her as if pursued. An enormous hand descends and blocks her way. She runs back the way she came and finds her way blocked by another hand. It becomes apparent that she is being toyed with by entities that do not appreciate her fragility, and as she dies, the infant she has been carrying and attempting to protect begins to cry.The view changes to reveal the Draag children who have accidentally killed the woman; they leave quickly when an adult Draag and child approach. The child voices concern for the orphaned infant, and the two take the child to their home. Tiva (the Draag child) names the infant Terr (word play on ""terrible"", same spelling in French; also a homophone for the French ""Terre"", meaning Earth). Her father, whom the adult Terr voice-over explains is master Sinh, the Draag great Aedile, attaches a collar capable of physically dragging Terr back from mischief, and over the next several scenes, their relationships develop.Terr witnesses the parents seemingly ingesting food by inhaling it from a device. After changing Terr's costume as one would a doll's, Tiva uses makeup to give herself a more Om-like appearance. When Terr impishly trades dark pigment for light, Tiva blows some of the powder on him. Tiva uses a tiny indoor weather-maker to cause a small storm cloud to form over Terr and chase him around the dwelling. Tiva takes Terr for a walk, and then teaches him how, under certain circumstances, crystals will form on stationary objects, including standing bipeds. She also teaches him that whistling will shatter the crystals. Terr happens upon master Sinh as he and several compatriots are melding in a ritual, and it is revealed that many Draag children have Oms like Terr when they convene to watch their respective Oms interact.Tiva's education is supplied by the use of a headset that transmits knowledge directly into the brain of the user. Because she enjoys having Terr in her hand when she is having her ""infos,"" Terr begins to acquire their knowledge.Meanwhile, at the seat of government, Draag Councilors discuss whether the regular extermination of the wild Oms is sufficient to keep their numbers at an acceptable level. It is revealed that Oms were first found on a planet that retained some evidence of structured life, but the images seem to reveal that Earth was in a post-apocalyptic state at the time.Terr decides to escape, and to take the headset with him. He does not get very far before Tiva realizes he is missing, and her mother tells her to use her bracelet to bring him back. Terr finds himself suddenly being dragged backward by the collar. Only the headset becoming entangled in plants allows a wild female Om to come to his rescue before he is choked by the collar or dragged all the way back.When Terr explains that the headset contains the knowledge of the Draags but he doesn't know where to go with it, his unnamed rescuer takes him to her tribe, who live in a tree in a walled park. When it is demonstrated that Terr can read Draag script, the leader (known only as ""Mighty One"") is willing to accept Terr into the tribe, but the Wizard is not, and demands a trial by combat to the death. Terr and the Wizard's champion have child-sized animals bound to their torsos in such a way as to prevent the combatants from using anything but the beaks of said animals to attack. Terr is injured, but wins the trial.Over the next several scenes, it is shown how the Oms have adapted to life on the Draags' planet. Snail-like animals weave clothes onto the Oms, predators that would eat Oms are in turn hunted and efficiently stripped of useful materials, and the gene pool is kept well-mixed. Oms even make the occasional foray into Draag areas in search of resources. Returning from one such expedition, the group of adventurers is accosted by ""bandits"" who drop clawlike harpoons into the cargo and simply lift it up into their own tree. Mighty One tells Terr that they live on the other side of the park, and cautions him that they are evil.When the now-literate Oms read the new sign on one of the walls, they realize the park is about to be ""de-Omised."" Terr decides that he must take this information to the tribe of ""bandits,"" and is quickly captured and taken before their leader, a wizened old woman.The woman is skeptical of Terr's claims. Terr is tied up and left. But when the de-Omising begins, the old woman returns and frees him. The de-Omising is accomplished using disks that release a poison gas. A great many Oms perish to this gas, but a sizable number still manage to escape through a crack in the park wall.Two passing Draags witness the exodus, and one begins crushing the Oms underfoot. The Oms retaliate and manage to bring down one of their attackers, but Mighty One is also killed, and the old woman leads the survivors to a place where she believes they will be safe. The death of a Draag puts the Council in an uproar. De-Omising is stepped up to a much higher priority, new technologies are developed, and frequency is scheduled to increase.The old woman has led the two now-united tribes to an old rocket depot. Applying their newfound knowledge, the Oms, seemingly under Terr's direction, very quickly adapt the abandoned technologies to their own purposes and begin to flourish, thanks to the rebirth of mechanized industry. On a visit to the old woman, Terr's former rescuer hears her express both optimism and regret that she will not live to see the Oms finally find peace.Fatalities resulting from Draag attempts to de-Om the rocket depot are minimized by the creation and organized use of shelters, but the Draags' updated de-Omising technologies become ever more aggressive, and when an automated scout detects the persistent Om settlement, it summons an array of lethal devices.As the attacks become more diverse and effective, the Oms launch their manned rockets toward the Fantastic Planet, where they discover headless statues. As bubbles descend to alight atop the statues, the statues begin to dance. Each bubble seems to contain an image of an individual Draag in meditation; their ""spirits"" are what animate the statues.It turns out that the statues facilitate ""nuptial rites"" between the Draags and entities from other galaxies, and from these, the Draags draw their life force. When the feet of the dancing statues threaten the rockets, the Oms use energy weapons that shatter the statues. Pandemonium reigns supreme in the Council chamber, for it seems the two races will destroy one another if they cannot find a way to live together.But in the very next scene, an Om steps down off an outstretched Draag hand, removes his silly hat and assumes a posture of confidence and self-assertion. The headset voice dispassionately recounts the Oms' construction of a new satellite where they can live, ""which they call Terr, after their ancestral planet ."""

The volunteer fire department is called into action, disrupting a sexual tryst between David (W.G. McMillan), a Vietnam veteran who works as the high school coach and volunteer fireman, and his pregnant fiancee, Judy (Lane Carroll).Judy, who works as a nurse for Dr. Brookmyre (Will Disney), is then summoned to the office by the doctor to help treat the traumatized Mitchell children. When she arrives, she is puzzled to find a man wearing a gas mask administering orders and tending to the children. As the firemen make their way to the Mitchell farm, they are puzzled by the sudden arrival of a platoon of soldiers.Back at the doctor's office, Major Ryder (Harry Spillman), who is in charge of the soldiers, orders some his men to don protective clothing, then gas masks, then announces that he is instituting an emergency quarantine and sealing off the town. Dr. Brookmyre, concerned about Judy's unborn baby, pulls the nurse aside to explain that a highly contagious virus has attacked the town. After inoculating Judy with an antibiotic to protect her against the virus, the doctor gives her a dose to administer to David, then urges her to slip out of the office, find David and isolate themselves from townspeople who may be carrying the disease.As the soldiers begin to occupy the town, David, worried about Judy, drives back to town, accompanied by his friend, Clank (Harold Wayne Jones), who is also a war veteran. While Colonel Chris Peckem (Lloyd Holler) is dispatched to Evans City to take command of the situation, Ryder confers on the phone with Brubaker (W.L. Thunhurst Jr.) and other officials at central headquarters in Washington DC. Unknown to the people in Evans City, a plane carrying a biological weapon has crashed over the town days earlier, sending a deadly virus into its water supply. Knowing that the virus will cause either death or insanity, the military plans to drop a nuclear bomb on Evans City as a last resort. Dr. Watts (Richard France), the head of TRIXIE, the team developing the virus, is also dispatched to Evans City. Dr. Watts asserts that the mission has not been carefully considered because a technician should have been sent into the field while the lead scientists remained at headquarters to analyze their findings. In their rush to make decisions without considering their ramifications, Brubaker and the other self-important officials order that martial law be instituted and the population be sequestered at the local high school. Soon after, soldiers in white-colored protective suits break into people's homes, apartments and a nearby motel, pulling frightened children from their beds to deliver them to the high school.After Peckem arrives in Evans City at the doctor's office, he orders a second perimeter to be set up to prevent anyone from leaving town. When the mayor, who is also a lawyer, threatens to sue Peckem for abrogating civil liberties, Peckem orders the local police disarmed, and when one officer refuses, he is shot dead by the soldiers.As the disease slowly poisons Evans' population, one farmer resists the quarantine and fires at the soldiers, while his daughter calmly plays the piano and his elderly wife stabs one of the soldiers with her knitting needles.Meanwhile, Clank, David and Judy have been apprehended by some soldiers and thrown into a van carrying Artie Bolman (Richard Liberty), his daughter Kathy (Lynn Lowry) and Clyde Winston, who is showing signs of insanity. When the van driver slams on his brakes, the prisoners escape and commandeer the vehicle. Winston, however, elects to stay behind, raving madly on the street.Upon arriving in Evans City, Dr. Watts announces to Peckem and Ryder that there is no antidote for the virus. Peckem blames the doctor for the situation and the doctor, in turn, accuses the major of blundering by forcing him into the field with no equipment.Meanwhile, Clank, Judy, David, Artie and his daughter seek refuge in an abandoned house for the night. Kathy begins to exhibit signs of dementia.The next day, as open rebellion spreads throughout the countryside, Peckem orders resistors to be shot and their bodies burned.Deciding to proceed to the Saunders farm on the outskirts of the perimeter, the five fugitives witness the soldiers gunning down an entire family and setting their bodies on fire as their young son watches. When Kathy begins to giggle at the massacre, Clank suggests leaving the Bolmans behind. Just then, a surveillance helicopter flies overhead, spotting the fugitives. When the helicopter opens fire on them, Clank and David shoot it down.Waiting until the cover of nightfall, the fugitives make their way to the Saunders house, where after killing the sentries outside, David and Clank enters the house and hold three soldiers hostage demanding to know what is going on. One of the soldiers finally tells David about the quarantine and that the virus makes people go insane and that it is in the town's water supply. But before the soldier can say anything more, one of the other soldiers reaches for his rifle and Clank kills the three soldiers in cold blood. Sickened by Clank's unwarranted violence, David soon realizes that his friend has been contaminated by the disease. David sequesters himself with Judy in an upstairs bedroom of the house where he confides in her about the virus. They hide out in the bedroom all night until morning before they can move out.By this time as dawn arrives, Artie has also contracted the disease, and believing that Kathy is his late wife, rapes her. Witnessing this, Clank pulls Artie off Kathy, and soon after, Judy finds Artie's body hanging from a rafter above the cellar stairs. Kathy runs outside, and as she chases some sheep, soldiers appear and order to her freeze, but when she keeps advancing toward them, they shoot her.Judy, David and Clank flee into the woods surrounding the house, but when Clank becomes aware that he is losing his mind, he charges the soldiers, and after running out of bullets is shot in the head by them.In the lab, meanwhile, Watts analyzes blood samples taken from diseased victims in the hope of developing an antidote. Discovering a potential cure, Watts hurries to see Peckem without going through proper channels. Turned away by the soldiers, who mistake him for the diseased, Watts is herded into the crazed crowd sequestered at the high school. Swept down the stairs in the chaos, the doctor drops the vials of antidote and is knocked unconscious and dies.As Judy begins acting strangely, David explains to her that they must wait until nightfall to escape and conceals her behind a wall of concrete blocks while he hides in a watch tower. Soon after, several soldiers arrive, and one decides to search the watch tower. Knocking the soldier unconscious, David dons his protective suit and gas mask. When the other soldier discover Judy, David knocks him unconscious. After David frees Judy from her brick hiding place, some townsfolk arrive and, mistaking David for one of the soldiers, fire and hit Judy. David reflexively shoots them all down, sparing just one boy, who calls out, ""Coach"", revealing that the teen is not infected. Horrified at what he has done, David cradles Judy in his arms, who before dying, tells him she can feel the baby kicking.Soon after, Colonel Peckem reports to Brubaker that with over 1,500 people dead and the rest insane (including the Mayor, Dr. Brookmyer and many others), the situation is now under control. To Peckem's dismay, Brubaker informs the exhausted, disillusioned colonel that the disease has spread to Louisville, Kentucky, and that he is being dispatched there to deal with the situation. As Peckem is about to leave, David, the only person who is immune to the disease, and whose blood could provide an antidote, is brought in by the soldiers, who refuse to administer an immunity test to him. David does not inform the soldiers of his immunity.The final scene shows a disconcerted Colonel Peckem boarding a helicopter to Louisville, leaving behind a town in chaos with no end in sight."

Emperor of the North,1973,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070030/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"In 1933, during the Depression, Shack the brutal conductor of the number 19 train has a personal vendetta against the best train hopping hobo tramp in the Northwest, A No. 1. During the Great Depression, the US is full of people who are now homeless. These people, commonly called ""hobos,"" are truly hated by Shack (Borgnine), a sadistic railway conductor who swore that no hobo would ride his train for free. Well, none by ""A"" Number One (Lee Marvin), who is ready to put his life at stake to become a local legend--as the first person to survive the trip on Shack's notorious train.—Brian Peterson calyooper@email.com Driven to desperation by the economic depression of 1930s America, a subculture of hobos hopped freight trains to get from place to place in search of jobs, handouts, or even to take it easy sometimes. Emperor of the North Pole depicts a microcosm of this subculture set in Oregon, and actually used the Oregon, Pacific & Eastern railroad which was taken up in 1994 like so much other trackage around the country. Thus, this motion picture serves as not only a look into an important aspect of American history, but into a specific piece of it in the Pacific Northwest.The film opens with the mechanical star, 2-8-2 steam locomotive #19, stopping to take on water while a hobo who calls himself ""A-#1"" looks on in anticipation of hopping this local train. Meanwhile, the conductor, ""Shack"", makes his presence known to the other hobos hiding in the weeds with a menacing countenance. As they pull back onto the mainline, Shack spies an ambitious hobo hopping between cars and quickly makes him pay his fare by knocking him down between the rails to his death. This sets the tone for the movie. The single-minded, almost hateful Shack bound and determined to prevent anyone from riding his train versus the veteran hobo A-#1 bound and determined to ride the 19 train. Each has his reputation at stake.A-#1 manages to hop aboard and hide in a cattle car undetected, but a greenhorn punk who calls himself ""Cigaret"" gives him away as he, too, climbs into the same car. Shack sees the kid closing the hatch and locks them in, leading to an unexpected turn of events.A-#1 sets fire to the hay in the car in order to burn his way through the wooden slats. He succeeds and hurls himself off the car to make his getaway as the train pulls into the yard with smoke billowing up. The kid, Cigaret, follows him with glee, but his celebration is short-lived as the yard workers haul him into the shop for a good grilling.The kid spins a yarn as if he were the veteran hobo whose plans were bolloxed up by A-#1, but the yard workers believe him and set up a sure-thing bet designed to net some easy money from Shack's brakeman, Cracker. Right at payoff time, Shack stops their little game and learns that somebody is fixin to ride his train.Spurred into defending his reputation in this micro-society, A-#1 makes it known in the hobo community that he intends to ride the 19 to Portland, a feat which is unbelievable to all. They all declare, ""Nobody rides Shack's train!""On heightened alert now, Shack blasts his train out of the yard at high speed (highballing) to prevent anyone from hopping on and runs the train into the first trap set for him by A-#1: a switch thrown reverse into a short spur track. Since the railroad operated on train orders which depended on trains leaving and arriving at agreed-upon times, this put the 19 into jeopardy of not making it to the siding (the ""Junction"") before the Fast Mail train came blasting the opposite direction.Once they backed the train onto the mainline and got underway, A-#1 uncouples the cars from the tender, introducing yet another delay. Shack's frustration and genuine concern for the destruction and loss of life that would occur should the 19 not make it to the siding in time are evident as he pleads with the ""bo"" to stop interfering. Underneath it all we know that Shack is also vengeful, and he shall have his day shortly.As the Fast Mail train bears down on the switch, the 19 just barely makes it into the siding and clears the mainline with inches to spare, a fact not lost on the brakeman who would have become quite flattened otherwise. A-#1 is suitably impressed that the Fast Mail train was not a ""ghost story"" as he had thought.Unable to shake the pesky Cigaret, A-#1 reluctantly takes him under his wing to show him how to be a ""meat eater"" and make his way in life despite its hardships and the corruption of authority figures. We see a number of tricks of the hobo trade and hear a lot of the slang used by hobos, another slice of history capsulized. A few scenes bring a chuckle or two.*** SPOILER ALERT ***Ultimately, Shack meets A-#1 in a bloody, gruesome fight with chains, 2x4 boards, and even an axe. We can see the determination and agony of each of them as they intentionally draw out the brawl. While Cigaret looks on, Shack gets his comeuppance as A-#1 shoves him off the train. Yet, we hear Shack shouting ""You aint seen the last of me!""The cocky punk Cigaret boasts about ""their"" accomplishments, which drives A-#1 to decide that enough is enough, so the kid gets the heave-ho into the river, too. A-#1 dishes out a lengthy sermon to him as the train rounds the bend and into history."

On Sunday, April 29, 1973, Sergeant Neil Howie with the West Highland Constabulary flies solo to Summerisle off the coast of Scotland. He is there to follow up on a letter addressed specifically to him from an anonymous source on Summerisle reporting that a twelve year old girl who lives on the island, Rowan Morrison, the daughter of May Morrison, has long been missing. The correspondence includes a photograph of Rowan. Upon his arrival on Summerisle, Howie finds that the locals are a seemingly simple minded lot who provide little information beyond the fact that they know of no Rowan Morrison and do not know the girl in the photo. Mrs. Morrison admits to having a daughter, seven year old Myrtle, but no Rowan. As Howie speaks to more and more people, he begins to believe that Rowan does or did live on the island, but that the locals are hiding their knowledge of her. He also begins to see that the locals all have pagan beliefs, their ""religion"" which centers on procreation as the source of life. That procreation does not necessarily need to be within marriage, and openly flaunts the act of sex, both in private and in public. These beliefs do not sit well against Howie's strict Christian morals, he who regularly attends church, prays, and accepts communion. Everything that happens on the island seems to be dictated by Lord Summerisle, whose ancestors bought the island generations ago. Howie begins to believe that Rowan was murdered, she a sacrifice by the islanders to their higher power to ensure a bountiful apple crop - the main crop of the island - which did not materialize last season.

Couples copulate openly in the fields, children are taught in school of the phallic importance of the maypole, toads are placed in the mouth to cure whooping cough, and the island has no Christian ministers or priests. Its church and graveyards have long been deconsecrated and are now used for the idiosyncratic burial rituals of the locals, who believe in re-incarnation.In the course of his investigation, Howie encounters difficulty in extracting information from the islanders, who claim never to have heard of Rowan, and whose own mother insists does not exist. Rooming at The Green Man Inn, where he is introduced to the beautiful young daughter of the landlord, Willow, Howie notices a series of photographs celebrating the island's annual harvests adorning the wall of the bar with each photograph featuring a young girl, the May Queen. The latest photograph is missing due to it being ""broken"". No negative exists.After discovering a grave bearing Rowan Morrison's name in the cemetery, Howie's search eventually brings him into contact with the island's community leader, Laird and de facto figurehead Lord Summerisle, who explains to Howie the island's recent history and culture. Summerisle's grandfather, a distinguished Victorian scientist, developed several new strains of fruit that he believed could prosper in Scotland's climate given the proper conditions. Drawn to Summerisle's unique combination of fertile, volcanic soil and local waters heated by the Gulf Stream, he inculcated in the local populace a belief that the old gods were real and worshipping them by farming the new crop strains would deliver them from their meagre livelihood. The crops bore fruit and the island's Christian clergy were driven away, with the population now embracing pagan teachings wholesale. Enraged by Summerisle's glib comment that the Christian god is ""dead"", Howie demands permission to exhume Rowan's body, which Lord Summerisle subsequently grants, confident in the belief that such a deeply religious community as his is incapabale of murder. Howie's exhumation of the grave reveals only the body of a hare. He angrily confronts Summerisle once more, declaring that he believes that Rowan Morrison was murdered as part of a pagan sacrifice and that he intends to bring the full weight of the law upon the inhabitants of the island.Breaking into the local chemist's shop, Howie discovers that a negative of last year's harvest photograph does in fact exist. It shows Rowan standing amidst a meagre, pathetic group of boxes, indicating that last year's harvest was a poor one and that the crops the island's only means of income had failed. Struck by his recollection of an offhand remark made by Lord Summerisle about appeasing the old gods ""when necessary"" and by research that indicates pagan societies offer up a human sacrifice in the event of crop failure, Howie deduces that Rowan is in fact still alive and that she is being kept hidden until she can be sacrificed as part of the May Day celebrations to ensure a plentiful harvest for the coming year.Howie spends another night at the Inn where, in the room next to his, Willow sings to him and openly attempts to seduce him. The next morning, discovering that his plane has been sabotaged and is unable to take off, Howie elects to search the island for Rowan himself ahead of the impending May Day parade. Howie ties up the innkeeper and assumes his place as Punch, a principal character of the May Day festival. Disguised, he joins the procession of islanders as they cavort through the town and perform harmless sacrifices to the various lesser gods. Then Lord Summerisle announces that a grimmer sacrifice awaits them, and Rowan is finally revealed, tied to a post. Howie cuts her free and flees through a cave but after a brief chase emerges at another entrance on a precipice where Summerisle and his followers stand waiting for them. Howie is shocked to see Rowan merrily embrace her captors and then notices that he is being surrounded.Lord Summerisle explains to Howie that, after painstaking research on their behalf, he specifically was lured to Summerisle by the islanders, who have been successful in a conspiracy to lead him to believe that a missing girl was being held captive against her will, and confirms to him that last year's harvest failed disastrously, threatening the inhabitants with a return to their previously desperate existence and that they have no intention of allowing that to happen. Their religion calls for a sacrifice to be made to the Sun god as Lord Summerisle explains that, ""animals are fine, but their acceptibility is limited. A young child is even better, but not nearly as effective as the right kind of adult."" Howie's devout Christian lifestyle and his livelihood as a policeman mean that he meets the outstanding criteria for a human that is to be sacrificed to appease the gods he has come of his own free will, with the power of a king and he is a virgin. In spite of his protestations that the crops failed because fruit was not meant to grow on these islands and that next year the sacrifice of Lord Summerisle himself will be called for, Howie is stripped bare, then dressed in ceremonial robes and led to the summit of a cliff with his hands tied. He is horrified to find a giant, hollow wicker man statue which he is then locked inside. The statue is soon set afire. As the islanders surround the burning wicker man and sing the Middle English folk-song ""Sumer Is Icumen In"", a terrified Howie curses them and recites Psalm 23 as he prays to God for accession to Heaven. The film ends as the burning head of the wicker man falls from its shoulders, as the sun sets in a blood-red sky."

His larceny is not a compulsion in and of itself, but a means to support his passion of driving in demolition derbies. Veldini has two primary objectives this time out of prison: never to return to prison, and to reach a specific milestone in his demolition derby career, these two goals which may be incompatible. One of Veldini's brothers, Frank Veldin (who has anglicized his surname), a police detective, is determined for Veldini to live a life of the straight and narrow at any cost. Frank has ulterior motives as he has political aspirations, most specifically to take a run for District Attorney. At their regular hangout of the scrap yard, Veldini reconnects with some of his old ""motley"" crew, who are equally as non-conformist as him: Eagle, a former human fly in a circus who realizes he is a bit off kilter as shown by he institutionalizing himself voluntarily, and Veldini's kid brother, known solely as The Kid, a guitar player who will follow Veldini in whatever he wants to do. Somewhat outside of this group is Iris Caine, a hooker with unofficial connections in high places. Eagle is certain that Veldini won't survive in the outside the way that Frank wants, and thus is able to convince another motley crew member, Duval Jax, based on his current abode and project, Veldini and the rest of the crew to work on an ultimate goal: to make the plane in which Duval is currently renting and living in operational so that they can escape the tyranny that is Veldini and their collective current lives by flying away to wherever their hearts' desire. In order to do so, they need to buy the plane and purchase the parts they can't scrounge from the scrap yard. That would require the collective to enter or reenter a life of larceny. The major obstacle to them achieving this goal is Frank, who would not hesitate to send Veldini back to prison for his own personal gain.—Huggo Drifter Veldini frequently finds himself in jail for various misdemeanours, much to the despair of his upright lawyer brother Frank, who is aiming for public office.

Coffy is little more than shaken, but Carter is beaten unconscious and seriously injured.More angry than ever, Coffy sets out to stop the mobsters once and for all. She learns of a pusher named King George (Robert DoQui) who is supplying heroin to local dealers. George is also a well-known pimp; Coffy is vaguely familiar with George because one of his prostitutes, Priscilla (Carol Locatell), once came to Coffy's hospital after George cut her face. Coffy visits Priscilla at her home and leans on her for information about George and his business practices. Priscilla tells Coffy about Arturo Vitroni and how he is one of George's best clients. Vitroni apparently likes to treat his hookers cruelly, humiliating them and making them do degrading things for his pleasure. Priscilla balks when Coffy asks her where George keeps his stash; she is afraid that if she tells Coffy this, George will find out and kill her, so she pulls a knife on Coffy and tries to frighten her off.

One of Vitroni's goons recognizes Coffy from the night they roughed her up along with Carter; another of Virtoni's shady associates recognizes Coffy as Howard Brunswick's girlfriend. Believing her to be a hit woman, the gangsters summon Brunswick, unsure about whether he is associated with Coffy's attempted hit. Vitroni is suspicious when he realizes that Coffy and Howard do indeed know one another, but Coffy insists Howard had nothing to do with her attempt on Vitroni's life, blaming it entirely on King George. To her dismay, Howard betrays Coffy and tells Vitroni that for all he cares, they can kill her.Omar and some other goons take Coffy to a desolate area of the city with intentions of killing her and dumping the body. Along the way they inject her with some heroin they took from King George's stash--Coffy knows it's really just sugar.

She toys with him and tells him she'll take a million dollar payoff to let him live, but after he tells her where Brunswick went, she shoots him anyway.Coffy's revenge isn't complete until she pays a visit to Howard. She slips into his beach house and surprises him, holding the shotgun on him. Howard is shocked to see Coffy alive, and even more shocked to hear that she's killed all of his shady associates. Howard manages to soothe Coffy, convincing her that he was only playing along with the crooks to buy time. But his speech is interrupted by a woman calling for him from upstairs; a semi-nude white woman walks out of one of the bedrooms. Coffy responds by gunning down Howard right there in his living room as the terrified woman screams in horror. Coffy then stumbles out into the morning light, grimy and covered with bloody scratches and bruises, but alive."

The Legend of Hell House,1973,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070294/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A physicist, his wife and two mediums are hired to investigate the Belasco House, where 27 guests had inexplicably died in 1927, along with most of a team of paranormal investigators that was sent in the early 1950s. A team consisting of a physicist, his wife, a young female psychic and the only survivor of the previous visit are sent to the notorious Hell House to prove/disprove survival after death. Previous visitors have either been killed or gone mad, and it is up to the team to survive a full week in isolation, and solve the mystery of the Hell House.—Bloody Disgusting The wealthy Mr. Rudolph Deutsch promises a small fortune to the physicist Dr. Lionel Barrett; to the mental medium Florence Tanner; and to the physical parapsychologist Benjamin Franklin Fischer to investigate survival after death in the notorious Belasco House, a.k.a. Hell House. The house belonged to ""Roaring Giant"" Emeric Belasco that promoted orgies in the house and had mysteriously disappeared after a massacre. Fischer is the only survival of a previous investigation and the Dr. Barrett goes with his wife Ann Barrett. Along the days, Florence believes that there are entities in the house, including Belasco's son Daniel; Fischer keeps his mind closed expecting only to earn the promised money, and the skeptical Dr. Barrett brings a machine to drain the energy in the house. Will they be successful in their intent?—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Physicist Lionel Barrett is enlisted by an eccentric millionaire, Mr. Deutsch, to make an investigation into ""survival after death"" in ""the one place where it has yet to be refuted."" This is the Belasco House, the ""Mount Everest of haunted houses,"" originally owned by the notorious ""Roaring Giant"" Emeric Belasco, a six-foot-five perverted millionaire and supposed murderer, who disappeared soon after a massacre at his home. The house is believed to be haunted by numerous spirits, the victims of Belasco's twisted and sadistic desires.Accompanying Barrett are his wife, Ann, as well as two mediums: a mental medium and Spiritualist minister, Florence Tanner, and a physical medium, Ben Fischer, who is also the sole survivor of an earlier investigation. The rationalist Barrett is rudely skeptical of Tanner's Christian faith and spiritual beliefs, asserting that there is nothing but unfocused electromagnetic energy in the house. Barrett brings a machine he has developed, which he believes will rid the house of any paranormal presence or force.Though not a physical medium, Tanner begins to manifest physical phenomena inside the house. When, after a quarrel with Tanner, Barrett is attacked by invisible forces, he suspects that Tanner may be using the house's energy against him. Meanwhile Fischer remains aloof, with his mind closed to the house's influence, and is only there to collect the generous pay offered him to return.Ann Barrett is subjected to erotic visions late at night, which seem linked to her lackluster sex life. She goes downstairs and, in a seeming trance, disrobes and demands sex from Fischer. He instead strikes her, snapping her out of the trance, and she returns to herself, horrified and ashamed. A second incident occurs a day or so later (this time, she is awake but uninhibited due to alcohol); her husband arrives a moment later to witness her advances to Fischer and is resentful, stating to Fischer's face that he believes that Fischer no longer has any psychic ability and that ""Mr. Deutsch is wasting one-third of his money!"" Stricken by the accusation, Fischer finally drops his psychic shields but is immediately attacked.Tanner, convinced that one of the ""surviving personalities"" is Belasco's tormented son Daniel and determined to prove it at all costs, finds a human skeleton chained behind a wall. Believing it to be Daniel, Tanner and Fischer bury the body outside the house and Tanner performs a funeral. Despite this, Daniel's personality continues to haunt Tanner; she is scratched violently by a possessed cat and Barrett, seeing the scratches, suspects that Tanner may be mutilating herself. In an attempt to put the supposed Daniel to rest, Tanner gives herself to the entity sexually, and later appears to be possessed herself, temporarily.Barrett's machine is assembled. Tanner attempts to destroy it, thinking that it will harm the spirits in the house, but is prevented. She enters the chapel, the unholy heart of the house, in an attempt to warn the spirits, and is crushed by a falling crucifix. (During her dying moments, she leaves a clue written in her own blood, to the true source of the haunting, which she now knows.) Barrett meanwhile activates his machine, which seems to be effective. Finally activating his psychic abilities as he wanders in the house, Fischer declares the place ""completely clear!"" in astonishment. However, soon afterwards, violent psychic activity resumes and Barrett is killed.Fischer decides finally to confront the house, with Ann accompanying him despite her misgivings. In the chapel, a confrontation ensues: thanks to clues from the manner in which Tanner, Barrett and the previous investigators had died, Fischer deduces that Belasco is the sole entity haunting the house, masquerading as many. He taunts Belasco, declaring him a ""son of a whore"", and that he was no ""roaring giant"", but likely a ""funny little dried-up bastard"" who fooled everyone about his alleged height. Even as objects begin to hurl themselves at Fischer, he continues to defy the entity, until all becomes still, and a portion of the chapel wall shatters, revealing a hidden door.Going inside, Fischer and Edith discover a lead-lined room, containing Belasco's preserved body seated in a chair. Pulling out a pocketknife, Fischer rips open Belasco's trouser leg, discovering his final secret: a pair of prosthetic legs. Fischer and Ann realize Belasco had had his own stunted legs amputated, and used the prosthetic in a grotesque attempt to appear imposing. Belasco had the lead lined room specially built (Belasco himself possibly suspecting the electromagnetic nature of life after death that Barrett's theories predicted), in the event of his death, to preserve his spirit, afraid of what may happen otherwise.With the room now open, Fischer activates Barrett's machine a second time, and he and Ann leave the house, expressing hopes that Barrett and Tanner will guide Belasco to the afterlife without fear."

In the heart of a myth-ridden, mountainous region of Germany, an impregnable, centuries-old castle--where young women worship Wanda, an ancient vampire aristocrat--casts its cursed shadow over the land. Driven by the essence of warm, bright-red blood and the power of unseen dark forces, the evil temptress forces her luscious female followers to give in to their most intimate sexual impulses, to preserve her unholy spirit. But in this hellish purgatory of perversion and blood, the accursed black sisterhood is unaware that the raven-haired leader of sin has an ulterior motive: to reincarnate in the fresh body of one of her satanic disciples.—Nick Riganas Nestled in the mountains of Germany, a grim and secluded castle stands - the haunted legacy of the beautiful medieval vampire Baroness Varga. Put to death for her ravenous hunger for female blood, the Baroness uttered a curse that she would one day return to forever satisfy her unnatural lust...and that day has finally come. Four women have gathered at the castle unaware that its darkly seductive housekeeper is a satanic high priestess presiding over a coven of delectable servants who each night perform sensual rituals and profane acts to keep the Baroness' spirit alive. As the women are drawn deeper into the ultra erotic nightmare, it will be the most uninhibited among them who shall serve as the vessel into which the Baroness passes...to continue her unholy reign of terror.—Seduction Cinema Two young women, Helga Borich [Marie Forså] and Monika Tarnek [Ulrike Butz], one or both of whom
may be a direct descendent of Baroness Dania Varga who was burned as a
vampire and witch in the 17th century, have arrived at Castle Varga. They
are met by the housekeeper, Fraulein Wanda Krock [Nadia Henkowa], and several of her
staff, all of whom are dressed in long, matronly, black dresses.
After getting settled in their rooms, Helga, Monika, and Monika's
girlfriend are taken to see a portrait of the Baroness, who is a
dead-ringer for Monika. As a storm brews outside, two travelers -- Dr
Julia Malenko [Anke Syring], an anthropologist studying the local superstitions, and her
brother Peter [Nico Wolf] -- knock on the castle door. They are having car trouble and
need shelter for the night. During the night, the guests are awakened by
the sound of chanting and bongo drums, which seems to bring out the libido
in everyone within earshot. Julia begins to suspect that something is
wrong and makes her brother wear a cross made out of garlic cloves. Julia
is wearing one just like it.The next morning, Julia recounts the story about Baroness Dania being
burned as a vampire witch during the 17th century. Legend has is that,
because she died without being staked, her spirit is waiting around to
take over a body and return to life. As the day proceeds, Peter and Helga
appear to be falling in love, much to the displeasure of Julia, who
harbors incestuous feelings for her brother. That night, as the chanting
and bongos begin again, Helga can barely stand the libido rising in her
body. Meanwhile, Wanda is thinking that Julia knows too much. When Wanda
attempts to mesmerize Julia, however, Julia lifts her garlic cross and
breaks Wanda's spell. That night, the chanting and bongos again affect
Helga, but this time Wanda tells Helga that she must get Peter's cross in
order to make ""the throbbing"" stop.The next morning, Julia warns Peter that there is something going on
at the castle that she doesn't quite understand but that it could lead to
their destruction if they don't leave, but Peter doesn't want to go unless
Helga goes with him. When Helga calls him to her room and pleads with him
to help her because her body, soul, and mind are being destroyed, Peter
removes the garlic cross from around his neck and places it on Helga. When
Wanda sees the cross around Helga's neck, she grabs a poker, lifts the
necklace over Helga's head, tosses it in the fire, and smiles. Now there
is nothing standing in her way. She admits to Julia, who is beginning to
figure it out (having written a book about the Vargas), that Wanda and her
black sisters, are actually priestesses of Baroness Dania and that they
are planning for a mating between one of the sisters and a male descendent
of Dania's line, an event that can only happen once every nine years
during a particular phase of the moon -- the night of the Vampire. Wanda
also tells Julia that she and her brother are descendents of the traitor
Donnashova[sp?] who fingered Baroness Dania. Fortunately, one of her
priestesses scooped up her ashes, and they have been been keeping Dania
""alive"" for these past 300 years.Now Julia is really concerned. She tries to talk with Monika, but
Monika is ""asleep"" and Julia cannot awaken her, so Julia goes looking for
her brother. As the sun sets, Monika wakes up and orders her friend, who
is now her renfield, to bathe and dress her. When prepared, Monika and her
renfield head for the dungeon where the priestesses, along with Peter and
Helga, are ready to perform the ceremony. Wanda kisses Monika, which
apparently passes Dania's spirit into Monika's body. Monika/Dania
indicates that she wants to drink Helga's blood. Meanwhile, Julia is still
searching for her brother when she is attacked by bats who manage to rip
off her clothes. Fortunately, Julia is able to hold on to her cross, and
she uses it to chase away the bats.The next morning, Peter returns to his bedroom to find Julia asleep
in his bed. Julia tells him that she believes the vampire was reawakened
last night. Peter chastizes her for believing those ""old wives' tales"".
After breakfast, Peter, Helga, and Julia go for a walk, during which Julia
finally convinces Peter to leave with her. They spend the day traipsing
through the forest, but by nightfall they find themselves back at the
castle, where they are greeted by Monika/Dania, who plans to drink Julia's
blood and watch her die on a stake. It's not going to be easy because that
garlic cross Julia wears is pretty powerful, so she sends Peter to seduce
Julia and make her take off the cross. However, Julia notices that Peter
is not wearing his cross and concludes that Peter is acting under the
Baroness's power. Julia uses her cross to ward him off.Plan two is to make Peter strangle Julia, but Julia manages to ward
him off again. Later, Julia goes looking for Peter who, by now, is in the
dungeon making love to and having his blood drunk by Monika/Dania. Julia
is chased back to her room by two of the priestesses. A few hours later,
Peter comes to Julia's room with no memory of where he's been or what he's
been doing. She puts him to bed and places her garlic cross around his
neck. When the priestesses begin to chant, Julia is unprotected and
succumbs to their mesmerism. Fortunately, Peter is able to hold Julia back
with the cross and prevent her from going to them.Plan three is to send Helga to Peter with the message that, if the
Baroness can't have Julia, she'll take Helga instead. When Helga runs off
to join the Baroness, Peter grabs Julia and they follow Helga. She leads
them to an altar in the forest, where a stake has been erected. As Helga
nears the stake, Julia shouts, ""No!"" Monika/Dania releases Helga and turns
to Julia, biting her neck and drinking her blood. In her weakened state,
Julia stumbles near the altar. As Monika/Dania keeps drinking, Julia
breaks off the tip of the stake. She falls to the ground, the Baroness
zooms down on her, and Julia impales her on the stake.""At last, they are free,"" Julia says, as she watches the priestesses
walk off in shock, ""and the Baroness, at long last, is at rest."" [Original Synopsis by bj_kuehl.]"

When he learns that his younger brother, college student and activist Donny McKlusky, was murdered, his bound dead body found in a Bogan County Lake, he is able to convince the authorities to release him early in return for him finding evidence against the suspected culprit, Bogan County Sheriff J.C. Connors, not for the murder of which they have no idea of the McKluskys' suspicions against Connors, but concerning an active but somewhat cold IRS file, namely yet unproven but well known unreported lucrative profits in bilking moonshiners. They also know that the sheriff is crooked in other ways, but the IRS only has the jurisdiction on the tax evasion issue. They provide Gator with a souped up car fit for moonshine runs that would be able to outrun almost any on road vehicle, and a contact in Bogan County, Dude Watson, a mechanic who has no option but to cooperate, despite his own fears about Connors, in he being a con on probation, the conditions which they know he has broken. Dude in turn is able to set Gator up with moonshiner Roy Boone to infiltrate the business in the county as one of his runners.

Turkish Delight,1973,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070842/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A young love faces with old problems. Sort of a cross between Love Story (1970) and an earthy Rembrandt painting, this movie stars Rutger Hauer as gifted Dutch sculptor Eric, who has a stormy, erotic, and star-crossed romance with a beautiful young girl. The story follows the arc of their relationship and his interaction with her family. Told in flashback form, initially, Eric is seen as a libertine lothario collector, taking trophies from his sexual conquests and pasting them in a book. He sees a sculpture he made of his lost lover and goes into a flashback of his relationship with his wife. He meets the girl, falls in love with and marries her, and we meet her parents: a charming, well meaning, bumbling father, and his shrew of a wife, who's convinced Eric is too much of a bohemian to make a good mate for her daughter. Eventually, the petty jealousies, the sexual hijinks, and the climactic vomit scene prove to be too much for the marriage, and Eric and his lady separate. Flash forward several months, and Eric finds the girl back in The Netherlands after an American sojourn. Their reunion is short lived. The somewhat melodramatic ending mirrors Love Story (1970).—<cfidalgo@intrex.net>"

This man is Zambrini (Marc Lawrence). He talks to the corpse as he prepares to toss it into the pig pen, explaining that the pigs were roaming free one night and they happened upon a drunk sleeping in a field. After eating the sleeping drunk, the pigs gained a taste for human flesh and now, nothing else will satisfy them.A Volkswagen Beetle driven by a young woman down a series of increasingly isolated back roads. This woman is Lynn Hart (Toni Lawrence), and the song that plays over the opening credits advises her to ""keep on driving"", because ""somebody's waiting for you somewhere down the road"". After driving past a series of oil wells somewhere in rural California, she stops at a dead-end road, where she finds a small roadside diner. There is a sign in the diner's window that says ""Waitress wanted"". As she steps out of her car, she is startled by the squealing of the pigs, but she continues inside, where she meets Zambrini. This is his diner, and without much dialogue passing between them, he hires Lynn as a waitress and helps her get settled into a spare room in the back of the diner where she will stay. She finds a strait razor in the medicine cabinet in her room while she is preparing for bed. She has a nightmare that Zambrini enters her room and slashes her with the razor over and over again, but she wakes up and realizes it was just a nightmare. She goes outside, starts looking around the property and hears the pigs squealing again, but before she can approach the pig pen, Zambrini grabs her and warns her never to go looking around back there.Zambrini's closest neighbors are a pair of elderly sisters, Miss Macy (Catherine Ross) and Annette (Iris Korn). They are in the habit of calling the local sheriff, Dan Cole (Jesse Vint), and complaining to him about Zambrini's pigs. They can hear the pigs squealing from where they live, but they also claim that the pigs run free at night and come right up to their house, and that Zambrini murders people and feeds their dead bodies to his pigs, after which another pig will appear in the pig pen.While Lynn is serving customers at the diner, one of them, named Ben (Paul Hickey), begins hitting on her, although she rebuffs his advances. He tells her Zambrini's back story, about how he was a circus performer who fell from a high wire during a performance and was pronounced dead, only to be taken to the morgue, where they discovered he was not dead at all. Cole arrives and talks to Zambrini about the complaint he got from the Macys, warning him to make sure his pigs are all in their pen and that they stay there. He also meets Lynn, frightening her for a moment by telling her she is driving a ""missing car"". It turns out he is only referring to her registration, which is outdated. She promises to update it. Afterwards, Lynn makes a seemingly desperate phone call to her father, telling him that she had to leave, but that she will return to be with him as soon as she can. We only hear Lynn's side of this conversation.Later, Zambrini pays an uninvited visit to the Macys, entering their home unannounced and terrifying them by wearing bizarre makeup that he used during his days as a circus performer.Ben returns to the diner and asks Lynn out again, this time telling her that he discovered an out-of-place nurse's uniform discarded in a field nearby, seemingly implicating Lynn, the stranger who has just arrived in town. Although Lynn tries to deny any connection to the uniform, she agrees to go out on a date with Ben. Unfortunately, Ben drives her to an isolated location and tries to force himself on her, seemingly willing to rape her if she does not comply with him. Fortunately, she is rescued by Cole, who arrives on the scene and gives her a ride back to the diner.Lynn then mysteriously invites Ben back to her room at the diner, apologizing for not accepting his advances. She puts on a show for him by wearing sexy lingerie, and then she gets into bed with him. However, she produces the strait razor and violently slashes Ben over and over again with it, killing him. Zambrini discovers the murder scene, with Lynn staring off into space and absentmindedly singing to herself next to Ben's dead body. Calming Lynn down, he cleans her up and takes her to his own room, where he puts her to bed and she falls asleep. Afterwards, he removes Ben's body, cuts it into pieces and feeds the pieces to the pigs.Lynn wakes up the next day with seemingly no memory of the incident, but she walks down the road to a pay phone, where she places another one-sided phone call to her father. When she cannot reach him, she runs back to the diner, ""chased"" by her half-remembering the dying screams of Ben and the threatening squealing of the pigs.Ben is missed at work, and Cole begins investigating his whereabouts, leading him to the diner. He talks to the Macys, who claim to have seen him arrive at Zambrini's diner, never to have left, while the pigs ""went crazy"". Cole questions Zambrini again and tries to look at the pig pen, attracted to it by the howling of Ben's dog, which has apparently located Ben's corpse by its sense of smell. A human hand is lying just outside the pig pen, but Zambrini manages to hide it by standing on it and Cole leaves none the wiser. Cole returns to the Macys, where a doctor (Walter Barnes) is doing a checkup on one of the sisters. Cole and the doctor have a conversation about Miss Macy's belief that Zambrini turns people into pigs by feeding their dead bodies to his pigs, and the doctor tells him that the ancient Egyptians actually believed this was possible, and that a human turning into a pig was a step toward becoming divine. Lynn herself proves impossible for Cole to question, staring off into space again and absentmindedly playing with her hair.Cole is not the only one looking for Ben, however. Zambrini discovers a group of young men prowling around his property, presumably Ben's co-workers at one of the oil wells. They find nothing, but beat up Zambrini and tell him to leave town.Things start to unravel for Lynn when a man named Jess Winter (Jim Antonio) arrives in town and starts asking for Lynn. He is eventually referred to the diner, where he approaches her in a non-threatening way and tells her they have some ""mutual friends"" who care about her. Our suspicions about Lynn are confirmed when he implies that Lynn has escaped from an insane asylum. He tells Lynn that she is welcome to come back, and Lynn is happy at first, asking about a doctor that she seemed attached to in a fatherly way. Zambrini overhears them talking, and when Lynn goes to pack her things in order to return with him, Winter talks privately to Zambrini, telling him that Lynn has escaped from an insane asylum and he is a private investigator hired by the asylum's staff to find her and bring her back to continue her treatment. When Zambrini asks Winter about Lynn's father, he tells him Lynn has no father - her father, in fact, is dead.Having become somewhat attached to Lynn, Zambrini does not want her to leave, and asks her to stay. Lynn agrees, luring Winter into turning his back on her and then stabbing him to death over and over again with a large kitchen knife. The body is dragged by Lynn over to the pig pen and tossed into it, where the pigs immediately eat it.Lynn's world continues to close in on her when the asylum calls Cole, telling him that Winter is missing and Lynn is an escaped mental patient with homicidal tendencies. Cole calls Zambrini at the diner and tries to warn him about Lynn, telling him to act as if nothing is wrong and wait for them to come and take Lynn into custody. Zambrini, however, immediately tells Lynn that the police are coming for her and they need to make it look as if she has left. When Lynn mentions her father, Zambrini repeats what Winter had told him: her father is dead. Lynn reacts violently to this statement and stabs Zambrini in the back with the large kitchen knife, killing him.Knowing that the police are coming for her, she makes one final phone call to her ""father"", and this time a repeating recorded message on the other end is heard on the phone, telling her over and over again ""We're sorry, but you have reached a number that is disconnected or is no longer in service. Please hang up and try your call again."" In her crazed mind, Lynn thinks she is talking to her dead father, weeping and telling him over and over again that she loves him. While she is weeping and talking, the human flesh-eating pigs, seemingly unseen by her, somehow escape from the pig pen and suddenly enter the diner and advance on her.Cole arrives at the diner and, presumably, finds the bloody aftermath of the pigs having eaten the bodies of both Lynn and Zambrini. He later tells Ben's co-workers that Lynn murdered her own father after enduring several years of sexual abuse from him, ultimately ending with him raping her, after which she went insane and killed him by stabbing him to death over and over again with a knife. All of the pigs are loaded into the back of a truck and taken away, seemingly to be slaughtered for meat, but Cole is startled to find that instead of the 12 pigs he had counted on his previous visits to the diner, there are now 13 pigs. Also found in the pig pen is the Egyptian ankh necklace that Lynn has worn around her neck throughout the entire film."

Lolly-Madonna XXX,1973,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070332/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"In the early 1970s, a young woman passing through rural Tennessee unintentionally gets caught in a feud between two local neighboring clans, the Feathers and the Gutshalls. Two rustic families, headed by patriarchs Laban Feather and Pap Gutshall, are feuding. At first, it is comical, with just the sons of the two families playing tricks on each other. But soon the Feather boys decide to kidnap a girl. She turns out to be innocent bystander Roonie Gill, not the made-up girlfriend ""Lolly Madonna."" As events escalate, Zack Feather and Roonie fall in love and try to bring the others to their senses. Will Roonie discover Zack's dark secret, the reason for the painful feud between the two families which once were close friends?—Dan Kuttner (KutRite@yahoo.com) This isn't perfect - I'm doing this from memory. But 'til now, there was no synopsis at all.The movie revolves around a minor feud between the Feather and Gutshall families. They dispute ownership of a small plot of land.As a prank and to provoke the Feathers, two of the Gustshall brothers forge a romantic postcard to themselves, from a fictitious girl named ""Lolly Madonna."" The postcard ends ""Lolly Madonna XXX"" (XXX meaning kisses).The Feathers find the postcard and decide to kidnap the girl to provoke the Gutshalls. They find a pretty girl, a stranger to the mountain, at a bus stop. The Feather brothers presume she's ""Lolly."" The girl says her real name is Roonie Gill, but the Feathers don't believe her and kidnap her anyway.Pap (Robert Ryan) decides to save Roonie (""Lolly""), even though he doesn't know her. The two families have minor skirmishes, but each one escalates.The Feathers steal a pig from the Gutshalls, partly as a prank. Sister E Gutshall comes to get the pig back, and seems also to want to visit with Hawk feather, on whom she has a crush. She watches as Hawk, a hopeful country singer, singing and performs as he fantasizes he's on stage.Sister E taunts Hawk, who chases her. He catches her and they start to make out. (I think) Skylar wants to join in, but Sister E resists. Both brothers end up raping Sister E. She goes home to her mom and dad crying. This further enrages the parents against the Feather family.Two Feather sons and their father, Laban, stake the stolen pig out where Pap Gutshall can see it. They threaten to shoot it if Laban doesn't give them title to some disputed land between them. The argument escalates and the Feathers set fire to the grass around the pig. Roonie attempts to rescue the pig, but can't. Pap shoots the pig to put it out of its misery in the fire.Fuming for revenge, Pap has Ludie, his overactive son, and Villum his Vietnam-vet son start an attack on the Feather house.Inside the Feather house, it appears there's a dark secret which has torn the family apart. Laban hates his son Thrush, who goads Laban into beating him up. Through flashbacks during the beating, we see that the two families were once close friends, bonded through the marriage of Zack (Jeff Bridges) and the daughter of Pap. Thrush was good with horses and trained the horse Pap's daughter loved. I found it odd that Zack was the only non-bird named son in the Feather family. Even the mom is named ""Chickie.""In the flashback, we see there was once love and happiness in the family. It all ended with a tragic accident, in which Zack's wife, who is also Pap Gutshall's daughter, fell off a horse and was killed. Laban kills all the horses including the ""guilty"" one, and forever blames Thrush, who trained them all. We see at the end of the flashback that Laban has beaten Thrush to death.Meanwhile, Pap's son Zeb (Gary Busey) has come to make peace and is held hostage instead. It's apparent that Laban is losing his mind and the violence will escalate even further out of control.Skylar Feather decides this is all too much. The only way to live is to escape. He offers to take Roonie away to safety, but sees she and Zack are obviously in love. He leaves on his own. Ludie and Villum see the truck. Villum uses his sniper rifle to kill Skylar just as he drives off the property.Ludie and Villum set up a siege of the Feather house. There is gunfire between them and those inside. Hawk is fatally injured. He makes a last stand on the porch, wearing his on-stage jacket. Hawk is hoping to go out in style and perhaps end the battle. Villum shoots Hawk again. As he dies he has one final on-stage fantasy.Laban finally retreats into total insanity. Zack banishes him to his room, where he prepares sandwiches of ketchup and mayonnaise.In revenge for the killing of Hawk, Chickie Feather shoots and kills the hostage Zeb. Now, they have no cards to play and have to battle it out to the end.Ludie attacks the Feather house with egg ""grenades"" and Zack shoots him. Villum makes an angry charge and is also shot to death.Pap sadly walks back to his home, childless. His wife retreats to her room. It's obvious she is disgusted with this ""war"" and has no more respect or love for Pap.I believe Finch, the retarded Feather son, is still alive at the end. Chickie is left with him and the insane Laban. It appears that Zack and Roonie will leave the battle-scarred mountain and start a better life together somewhere else.That's the best I remember how it ends. Like Vietnam, there were no winners, except maybe those who ran off (to Canada, in the US case).Hope this has been helpful. It should be close to accurate. Feel free to improve upon it. My memory isn't what it used to be!YouTube has a behind the scenes video of this movie:(add "" /watch?v=JabMYjwYO7c "" to the their URL)Sister E. Gutshall (I have no idea what the E stands for) is still alive at the end, but she is shown taking off suitcase in hand too. Also, it wasn't Hawk she was in love with. It was Skylar. It was really a good movie, but the ending was so sad."

During the sightseeing in Toledo, Spain, the tourist Lisa Reiner sees an ancient painting of the devil on the wall and leaves her group for a moment; however she gets lost in the narrow streets. Later she gets a lift with the wealthy Francis Lehar and his wife Sophia. However, their car breaks and stops in front of an old manor. While the driver George tries to fix the car, the trio is hosted by the blind owner and her son Maximilian who invites Lisa to spend the night in the mansion. During dinner, they are served by the butler Leandro that resembles the image of the devil of the painting. Lisa seems to be living a strange nightmare, recalling her love from a past life, and trapped in the house with that bizarre family.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil [note: this synopsis is only for Mario Bava's true and original Lisa and the Devil (1973), not the re-shot, re-edited version 'The House of Exorcism' (1975)]Lisa Reiner (Elke Sommer) is a young American woman vacationing in Spain with some friends of hers. During a stop in a small town square with her tour group, Lisa grows to admire a fresco of the devil carrying a dead man's body which her tour guide describes as the devil carrying away lost souls back to Hell. As her group disperses, Lisa hears a beautiful piece of music. She leaves her companions and traces its source to an elaborate music box in a little antique shop just outside the main square. While inside the shop, she encounters a strange man (Telly Savalas) purchasing parts of a life-size mannequin. After making eye contact, Lisa is startled when the man bears an uncanny resemblance to the devil depicted in the painting. The man's peculiar behaviour distresses Lisa, so she flees from the shop to rejoin her friends.However, she becomes hopelessly lost in the maze of backstreets of the town. Though she has only walked a short distance beforehand, the back streets and alleyways seem totally alien to her. The locals refuse to give her directions, as side streets lead to dead ends. Lisa runs into the mysterious man a second time, though this time he is carrying a full-length, life-sized mannequin eerily similar to the painting depicted in the main square, as well as carrying the music box still playing the haunting tune. Introducing himself as Leandro, he gives Lisa some vague directions back to the main square, then walks around a corner and disappears. But the direction that Leandro points to the main square leads only to more unfamiliar streets. Next, Lisa encounters a strange man who looks a lot like the mannequin that Leandro was carrying. These bizarre coincidences begin to terrify Lisa, and the stranger acts as though she is his long-lost lover. Frantic, Lisa pushes him away and the man falls down a flight of stone steps, apparently dead. Lisa runs off in a panic.Night falls on the village, and Lisa remains lost. However, her luck seems to be improving when she hitches a ride in a old vintage 1940s limousine which contains Francis Leher (Eduardo Fajardo) and his wife Sophie (Silvia Koscina) whom are driving through the village with their chauffeur George (Gabriele Tinit). But their limousine soon breaks down just outside a old villa on the town's outskirts. The four travelers push their car into the villa grounds and knock on the front door asking for assistance. The villa turns out to be occupied by an elderly blind countess (Alida Valli), and her neurotic son Maximilian (Alessio Orano). When Maximilian spots Lisa, he becomes convinced that she is the reincarnation of a woman that loved and lost. Maximilian implores his mother to allow the four stranded tourists to stay for the night while he helps the chauffeur repair the car's engine. Though the villa is well-appointed, it has a strange atmosphere. Lisa is subsequently shocked to discover that Leandro is the family butler, who also recognizes her from their brief meetings earlier, and seems a little too friendly to Lisa.As Leandro settles Lisa, Francis and Sophie, and George into their living quarters for the night, Lisa jumps with fright when she sees the same man from the village who tried to attack her, staring at her through the window. Lisa tries to get away from the house, but her departure is thwarted by Maximilian, who begs her to stay. As she feels some attraction to the young man, as well as pity for him, Lisa relents.The four travellers are settled down to dinner, while the food is served by Leandro. Lisa further notices the weird atmosphere of the place, when Maximilian continues to remind Lisa that she has a resemblance towards his lost lover, Elena. But Francis and Sophie's relationship becomes more strained as dinner progresses. Francis' cold, dispassionate nature forces Sophie to walk away from him, and she falls into the arms of George, whom they have quick passionate sex. A short while later, George is found dead, with a pair of scissors plunged into his throat. Sophie immediately assumes that her husband did it, and she flees outside into the car where she starts it up, When Francis comes out to stop her from leaving, she runs over him over and over again. But upon returning into the house, Sophie is killed by Maximilian in a hurtful, gory way. It was Maximilian who murdered the chauffeur to prevent Lisa from leaving.With the meddling strangers out of the way, Maximilian turns his attention to Lisa where it's revealed that the man who pursued Lisa in the village is actually Maximilian's stepfather Carlos (Espartaco Santoni). Like Maximilian, he had previously fallen in love with Elena, the woman displayed in a few old photographs who bears an amazing resemblance to Lisa. Carlos had abandoned the countess and ran off with Elena, who was also Maximilian's lover. Before she had a chance to join him, Maximilian had murdered Elena and stored her body in a concealed room so he could continue to have her, even in death. Apparently when Carlos returned to the village, he assumed after seeing Lisa that she was Elena. Now that Maximilian had murdered Carlos, he puts him display in an open coffin in the parlor so that nobody can take Lisa away from him.At this point, Lisa still has no idea that Maximilian is completely deranged, and on top of that, she's still being casually nice to him. When Maximilian decides to share his secret with Lisa about his lost love Elena, he takes her to the concealed room, and shows her Elena's skeletal remains, Lisa finally then backs away in horror and rejects Maximilian. But rather than kill her, he chloroforms Lisa and puts her in the bed next to Elena's remains. Maximilian strips Lisa naked and tries to have sex with the unconscious woman. But in his twisted state of mind, he feels that the skeletal remains of Elena is mocking him and he cannot perform. Apparently deciding that in order to consummate the relationship, he will have to marry her.Maximilian meets his mother in the parlor who's paying respects to her dead husband where he tells her of his intentions. The Countess, jealous of the hold Elena, in the form of Lisa, continues to hold over the men in her life, demands that Maximilian kill Lisa and dispose of her and the rest of the bodies before the police show up looking for her and the other murder victims. But Maximilian's devotion to Lisa is complete, and rather then get rid of her, he stabs his mother dead as she stands by the coffin that contains Carlos' body.All of these events are observed by Leandro, whose presence seem to haunt the villa, and who seems to be orchestrating the bizarre occurrences as some kind of sick game. Unsettled by this act of matricide, Maximilian rushes about the house looking for Leandro who, for once, is nowhere to be found. Instead, Maximilian finds the bodies of all his victims, including the skeletal Elena, seated at the dinner table looking at him. He turns around and sees his undead mother shambling towards him. In shock, Maximilian recoils backwards, only to fall out a second floor window, and onto the spikes of a gate. Emerging from behind the body of the dead Countess, Leandro remarks, ""oh, it slipped"".The next morning, Lisa wakes up, naked and in unfamiliar surroundings. Though it seems to be the exact same concealed room, it is now infested with vegetation and she is alone with no bodies anywhere. Putting her clothes back on, Lisa walks through the house and finds that its entirely deserted. In fact, it looks that nobody has lived in the house for a long time. Confused, but somewhat relieved that the entire night's experience was apparently nothing but a bad dream, Lisa leaves the house and runs into a group of schoolgirls playing ball in the street. The balls rolls in her direction and she catches it. One of the the girls points to Lisa and proclaims her a ghost because nobody has lived in the villa for a hundred years. The girls run away screaming. Lisa walks around a little and within minutes finds herself back in the town square from the beginning of the movie. She is observed by Leandro a short distance away who is being given a mannequin likeness of her.Lisa takes a taxi to the airport and enters a plane. After the plane takes off, Lisa notices the she is the only passenger. She searches section after section, only to discover the dead bodies of Maximilian, the Countess and all the others in the first class compartment. Frantically, Lisa makes her way to the cockpit where she opens the door and discovers that Leandro is the pilot, who lets out a devilish laugh. Lisa transforms into a ghastly pale mannequin and slumps to the floor."

He tries to use the skeleton's blood to immunise her against this eventuality, but his attempt has anything but the desired result.—Jeremy Perkins {J-26} Two horror movie icons team up for this bone-chilling 1973 film by Freddie Francis, a master of the genre. Peter Cushing plays a scientist who begins to believe that a skeleton he has brought back from New Guinea may be infused with evil. Worried that his family will be punished by this malevolent being, he scurries the pile of bones away. Unfortunately, his nefarious brother has other plans for the skeletal find.
-Karen NadeauProfessor Emmanual Hildern returns from New Guinea with a skeleton which he believes will revolutionize mankind's theory of evolution, and perhaps win him the coveted Richter Prize. While having breakfast with his daughter, Penelope, Hildern reads a letter from his half-brother, James, which informs him that his wife, Marguerite, has died in James lunatic asylum. Hildern keeps this from Penelope, who believes that her mother died many years earlier.

There she learns that Marguerite was a Folies Bergere dancer, that she went insane, and was institutionalized. Hildern catches her; Penelope becomes hysterical.

Don't Look in the Basement,1973,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0069994/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A young psychiatric nurse goes to work at a remote asylum following a murder. There, she experiences varying degrees of torment from the patients. Nurse Charlotte Beale arrives at the isolated Stephens Sanitarium to work, only to learn that Dr. Stephens was murdered by one of the patients and his successor, Dr. Geraldine Masters, is not very eager to take on new staff. Charlotte finds her job maddeningly hard as the patients torment and harass her at every turn, and she soon learns why Dr. Masters is so eager to keep outsiders out.—matt-282 Dr. Stephens runs a secluded sanitarium with a small group of mental patients, one of whom uses the ax that was supposed to be for therapeutic wood-chopping to cut down Dr. Stephens. Now, Dr. Masters is running the asylum alone with her brand-new nurse, who does her best to befriend the eclectic group of patients: the shell-shocked ex-sergeant; the lobotomized Popsicle-sucking child-man; the puritanical former judge; the doom-dealing old woman; the would-be mother to a baby doll; the giggling, clown-haired prankster; the needy nymphomaniac; and the mainly catatonic young woman who occasionally indulges in knife attacks. The pretty young nurse was eager to work with the forward-thinking Dr. Stephens, but finds his successor to be less than welcoming and the hospital to be less than wholesome.—J. Spurlin Dr. Stephens (Michael Harvey) presides over a small hospital for the insane; the asylum is a large three-story white house located in an isolated, rural setting. With only himself and a small staff to care for the patients, his approach to psychiatric care is considered very liberal. He allows the patients access to their individual manias, believing that by encouraging them to act out their inner conflicts, they can resolve them.As the film opens, he is working with a patient named Oliver Cameron (Gene Ross), a former judge who is obsessively striking a wooden log with an ax. Nurse Jane St. Claire (Jessie Lee Fulton) is inside the sanitorium packing her suitcase, as if to leave. She has a confrontation with a patient named Harriet (Camilla Carr), a young woman who carries a baby doll and believes it to be real. Harriet accuses Jane of wanting to steal her baby, and threatens to kill her if she does. Jane rushes outside to tell Dr. Stephens that she has decided to leave the sanitarium for good; she can no longer tolerate the madness that runs rampant there. As she is talking to Stephens, the Judge suddenly turns and strikes Stephens with his ax, felling him. Jane shrieks, but suddenly another woman rushes towards them; she is Dr. Geraldine Masters (Annabelle Weenick), and she tells Jane to go inside, she will take care of everything. Inside the hospital, Jane rushes to get her suitcase and leave, but Harriet appears. Her ""baby"" is in Jane's room, planted there by some unseen person. Furious, Harriet attacks Jane and kills her, strangling her and then slamming her head inside the suitcase.That evening, a new nurse comes to the asylum; young, pretty Charlotte Beale (Rosie Holotik). Dr. Masters seems hostile to her presence, claiming she was unaware that Dr. Stephens had hired her, and she tells her that Dr. Stephens has been killed by the Judge. Masters tells Charlotte that she can't have the job, since she was hired by Dr. Stephens and he is now dead. Charlotte is distraught, not only because the doctor has been killed, but she says she quit an important job at an urban psych hospital to take the job at Stephens Sanitarium. Masters suddenly changes her attitude when Charlotte announces that she will return to her previous employers and tell them about Dr. Stephens' death and ask for her old job back; admitting that the hospital is now understaffed, Masters invites Charlotte to stay for the time being and shows her to her room. Charlotte tries the phone and discovers it is out of order.The next morning, Dr. Masters introduces Charlotte to the rest of the patients and briefs her on their histories; Danny (Jessie Kirby) is a childlike, bizarre young man who plays pranks and giggles maniacally; Sergeant Jaffe (Hugh Feagin) is a disturbed Vietnam vet constantly on the lookout for the 'enemy'; Sam (Bill McGhee) is a large black man with the mind of an eight-year-old child after a botched lobotomy four years ago (that Masters claims she was a part of); Allyson King (Betty Chandler) is a nymphomaniac constantly in search of physical and emotional affection; Jennifer Downey (Harryette Warren) seems mostly catatonic until she randomly explodes with sudden violence. Judge Cameron went crazy due to the stress of his former job, Harriet believes her baby doll is a living baby, and the final patient is a senile old woman named Mrs. Callingham (Rhea MacAdams). When Mrs. Callingham is alone with Charlotte, she tells her that she is in danger and that she must ""get out"".Sam takes an immediate liking to Charlotte, but he talks about Dr. Stephens in the present tense. Masters tells Charlotte that Sam just has no concept of death, so Charlotte ignores Sam's remarks about his discussions with Dr. Stephens. Strange things continue to happen, however. Masters seems unconcerned about having the phone reconnected. Jennifer attacks Charlotte with a knife, which Masters also tries to brush over. Mrs. Callingham again tries to warn Charlotte about something, but she awakens the next morning with her tongue cut out; Masters tells Charlotte that the old woman did it to herself in a fit.Later that day, someone steals one of the patient files from the office and Masters finds it in Sarge's room; as punishment, she sets the paper on fire and places it in his outstretched palm, burning his hand as punishment. The paper has Masters' name on it.Suddenly an interloper arrives. Ray (Robert Dracup), a telephone repair man, has come to the house to find out why the service isn't operating. Masters tries to send him away, but when he says that he'll have to come back with more help, she relents and lets him examine the phone box, which is inside a closet. While he is in there, Allyson discovers him and comes onto him suddenly, in a bizarre fashion, demanding that he say he loves her. The scene ends suggesting they have sex.The next day, Charlotte takes Danny for a walk around the grounds of the asylum where he tries to make a move on her, but she rebuffs his advances. That evening, Danny attacks Charlotte while she sleeps with a knife, but the Judge stops him and tells him that he needs to restrain himself.When Charlotte discovers several vials of medicine missing from the medicine cabinet, she tells Dr. Masters about the theft. Masters finds them in Jennifer's room and places them back in the medicine cabinet, locking it up. When Jennifer sees her room ransacked and the medicine missing, she goes to Masters' office to try to break into the medicine cabinet to get more, but someone kills her by stabbing her in her left eye with a metal desk implement.A little later, Sam is cleaning up the kitchen area after dinner when he opens a closet door and discovers something. He goes to get Allyson and tells her he has to show her something. Allyson follows him and Sam takes her to find the body of Ray, horribly slashed to death. Allyson becomes hysterical, wailing about how he loved her.Charlotte finds Allyson sobbing in her room where she tells her that Ray was going to take her away from the hospital, but Masters wouldn't allow it; she killed him to keep order in the asylum. Charlotte denies this but Allyson tells her what she has failed to realize (and what we suspected) all along: Masters is simply another patient in the asylum. Allyson tells her that Masters was a former physician who made a fatal error during a procedure and went insane when her dream of becoming a doctor was denied. Dr. Stephens had been allowing her to pretend to be his colleague as part of her therapy. Charlotte is horrified to discover that she is the only sane person in the secluded hospital.The inmates all confirm this with Charlotte, and the Judge suggests that Charlotte herself is insane, acting out her fantasy of becoming a nurse (because Masters told all of them that Charlotte herself is a patient). Charlotte finds that she cannot escape the house; all the doors and windows have been bolted shut. In desperation she enters the dim basement, only to encounter a shadowy figure who grasps at her ankles. In terror, she bludgeons it to death with Sam's toy boat, only to realize that the figure was Dr. Stephens, wounded but still alive in the basement. Charlotte also finds the body of Jennifer.""Doctor"" Masters confronts Charlotte and makes an attempt on her life. She has Sam (upset over Charlotte killing Dr. Stephens) take Charlotte upstairs to a vacant room where she plots to have Sam kill her. However, Sam has an change-of-heart and restrains Masters from harming Charlotte. Just then, the other inmates (Judge Cameron, Danny, Sarge Jaffe, Allyson, and Harriett) appear and attack Masters, revolting against her desire to keep them all under her command and of her inhuman treatment of them since Dr. Stephens death. Sam helps Charlotte escape through the basement and out the cellar door. While Charlotte flees down the road on foot in the pouring rain, Sam returns to find Masters dead; gorily hacked apart at the hands of the other inmates. In retaliation, he kills each of the inmates with an axe. In the final shot, Sam sits alone, the only survivor of the ordeal, eating a popsicle while covered in the blood of the dead inmates."

McIntosh-Smith <Simon.N.Smith@cs.cf.ac.uk> The seaside town of Fircombe is facing a crisis - it's always raining and there's nothing for the tourists to do.

The motion is carried in Augusta's absence and Sidney contacts publicist Peter Potter (Bernard Bresslaw) to help with the organization of the contest. Peter is engaged to Paula who is immensely protective of Peter & is angry to find that Peter is going to Fircombe to organize the publicity for its beauty contest.Sidney's girlfriend, Connie Philpotts (Joan Sims) runs a local hotel and soon her residents, including the eccentric Mrs Dukes (Joan Hickson) and the Admiral (Peter Butterworth) are outnumbered by dolly birds, including the feuding biker babe, Hope Springs (Barbara Windsor) and the bountiful Dawn Brakes (Margaret Nolan).
A cat-fight orchestrated by Hope provides better newspaper copy than bringing a donkey off the beach which, despite the bucket and spade of hotel employee William (Jack Douglas), ruins the plush carpets. Hope & Dawn are rivals and Hope maintains that last year Dawn stooped to stealing Hope's silver bikini to prevent her from participating in the contest. Hope has hated Dawn since then.Connie is angry that the half-naked beauty contestants are driving away her regular permanent customers.

The Offence,1973,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070468/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A burnt-out British police detective finally snaps whilst interrogating a suspected child molester. In Sidney Lumet's harrowing portrayal of police brutality, Detective Sergeant Johnson's been on the police force for 12 years. In that time, the numerous murders, rapes, and other felony crimes he's investigated has left a terrible mark on his psyche. His bottled-up anger and rage finally explode whilst interviewing Baxter - a suspect in a series of brutal attacks on young girls. Throughout the interview, Johnson brutally beats Baxter and reveals the state of his own mind is probably no better than some of the offenders who've committed the crimes that disgust him.—David Claydon <dc6212@bristol.ac.uk> The Offence begins with the police station in a panic, an officer running for help in slow motion, his expression indicating that something terrible has happened. We find Sergeant Johnson (Sean Connery) in an interrogation room, fighting with fellow officers who are attempting to restrain him. He looks around in disbelief, perhaps realizing what he's done, saying ""God, Oh my God.""We then flash back to Johnson and some fellow officers staking out a schoolyard hoping to catch a glimpse of a child abductor/rapist. Johnson walks the area while his other officers wait in a car. He catches suspicious glances from parents waiting outside the fenced in yard to claim their children. They aren't aware that he's a cop, only that a strange man is lurking near the schoolyard. A group of kids walking home is escorted a safe distance away, although one of the girls is shown leaving the group to head towards her own house. Getting in the car with the other officers, Johnson establishes very early that he's frustrated and isn't satisfied with police efforts.One of the girls is abducted nonetheless, a short time after leaving the safety of the group. She is quickly reported missing and a search party is organized. It's Sgt. Johnson who finds the girl in the woods. She screams when he finds her, still in shock, screaming. She's been raped, as suggested by her torn clothes and the mud all over her. Johnson comforts the girl, quieting her down, and wraps her in his coat. He seems to visualize the abductors actions almost putting himself in the criminal's place. He's panicked when the moment is broken by the search party finding them, acting startled for a moment, as if he himself is the rapist. He insists on escorting the girl to the hospital, snapping at Lieutenant Cameron (Peter Bowles) who tells him the girl is not in any state to handle questions. He's furious when a possible witness comes in to file a report, twenty hours late. Officers are directed to search everywhere for the rapist.Other officers later pick up Kenneth Baxter (Ian Bannen) for the crime when they find him covered in mud and scratched up, wandering around town, barely coherent. When Cameron's questioning goes nowhere, they decide they can't charge him. Johnson is somehow 100% certain that Baxter is their man, although Cameron reminds him that ""you can't be certain. Even you can make mistakes."" Johnson gets agitated convinced that Baxter is laughing at them.He takes the opportunity to question the suspect himself (although he is completely unauthorized to do so) Johnson has decided that this man is the culprit and can't bear to think of him going free. Johnson brings Baxter a cup of tea and finds his attitude has become more resistant to questioning. He begins pressuring Baxter, manhandling him and intimidating him in any way that he can. Cameron is directed to charge him or let him go, unaware that Johnson has started his own questioning. Johnson starts hitting Baxter and Baxter, tries to get to another door to escape the room angering Johnson even more. Cutting between the station and the questioning we find Baxter more bloody and beaten each time. The officers respond to screams and we find Johnson called out to sign a statement, then suspended and directed to go home until he's called. Cameron mentions that it's unlikely Baxter will live.Johnson drives home. and his mind starts recalling graphic and bloody images from past cases. We see him in beat cop uniform uncovering a particularly gory murder, which expands to include many other brutal scenes including a man falling from a rooftop and a body hanging from a tree in the woods. At home he heads straight for the liquor and starts drinking. His wife Maureen (Vivien Merchant) wakes up due to the noise he makes. She's initially angry that he's drunk and has broken her China doll. He remarks on seeing her in her bathrobe ""You're a mess! What happened to you? You never used to be such a mess."" He tells her he may have killed a man, and explains that pain was the only thing the man understood. He talks about the girl who is also in the hospital, and when Maureen says ""at least she's alive""He starts recalling other cases saying ""I've seen them dead too you know."" Maureen reminds him that he's not on his own. He says ""Why aren't you beautiful. You're not even pretty."" She continues attempting to help him, but he says he's always made a point of not talking to her."" ""Who will you talk to then?"" she asks. He starts rambling about the images in his head that he can't stop, going into graphic detail about victims of brutal crimes, his anger building with each detail. Maureen can't take the details and runs off to be sick. Angry that she couldn't listen after offering, he holds her down telling her ""You promised to make me happy and you didn't"" revealing his frayed sanity by implying that Baxter was the person she made happy. Fortunately for Maureen, the outburst is interrupted by the Cameron, who tells him he has to return to the station as Baxter has died in the hospital.Johnson meets with Lt. Cartwright (Trevor Howard) at the station, who is charged with performing an inquiry into the murder and obtaining the truth. Johnson attempts to describe the interrogation, but is cautioned by Cartwright when he starts describing what was going on in Baxter's mind. Johnson loses his temper several times with Cartwright, which doesn't seem to intimidate him in the least. Cartwright insists that Johnson can't know that Baxter was guilty. Johnson insists that he does know, and recalls his own handling of the girl in the woods to calm her down. ""What's happening to me?"" he asks Cartwright, describing all the disturbing pictures in his mind, revealing that he can vividly see the incident through Baxter's eyes. He grabs Cartwright's arms roughly but Cartwright forces him off and gets him to attempt to recount the scene. Johnson implies that Cartwright can deal with things more easily, because he doesn't get his hands dirty, having subordinate officers find the bodies. Cartwright takes offense reminding him that they've all had to do these things. Johnson keeps visualizing the girl again as is he were Baxter (with his own face) imagining her happy as he approaches in the woods and touches her face. Cartwright concludes that he has what he needs and as he's escorted down the hall, we see a flashback to the full interrogation scene.Johnson asks about Baxter's marriage, complaining that his own wife in bed seems like she's ""doing him a favor"" Baxter explains that in his marriage there are other things that are more important. Baxter then refuses to discuss his wife, threatening to report Johnson and talk to his lawyer. When Baxter stands up offended at a comment. Johnson starts handling him, comparing his handling to how he handled the girls. He makes Baxter very uncomfortable reaching his hands beneath Baxter's jacket in a clearly intrusive way. He tells Baxter that he'll make him feel like the little girls. He strikes Baxter and tells him to get up. Baxter tells him he's mad. Johnson's explanations of Baxter's actions, make it increasingly clear that his own repressed desires are angering him more than what Baxter may have done. Baxter exclaims ""You sad, sorry little man."" prompting Johnson to strike him again. Baxter realizes that Johnson won't let him leave, Baxter starts speaking personally telling Johnson that he's always felt alone. He recounts a bully from high school, and the feeling he got from being bullied, that the bully ""needed him"" saying that this gave him pleasure and the bully never knew that Baxter was ""having him."" Johnson starts laughing hysterically when Johnson segues from the bullying into asking if his father was a big man. When he can't stop laughing Johnson says ""Do you think you're having me?"" Baxter calls him pathetic which prompts another beating. Baxter exclaims ""I know you!"" When Johnson begins thrashing him again Baxter says ""Nothing I've done can be half as bad as the thoughts in your head. I wouldn't have your thoughts."" Johnson calms down momentarily as if he's had a realization while listening to Baxter. Baxter puts on his coat as if to leave, but Johnson asks Baxter to help him with the thoughts in his head, recounting some of them as he squeezes Baxter's hand. He sobs ""Help me."" but tired of having his hand squeezed, Baxter yells ""Help your bloody self!"" which prompts the final beating.Johnson recounts the scene as he waits saying ""He knew. I had to kill him."" We then arrive back at the beginning seeing Johnson fight off his fellow officers and coming to his senses saying ""God, oh my God."""

As such, he achieves in a few weeks what it usually take years for others, namely having his own sales territory, the northeast and ultimately Scotland, for Imperial Coffee. He is also able to garner a plethora of fringe benefits from this job, including women throwing themselves at his feet. But he will ultimately face a struggle in class and authority warfare, which culminates with his encounter with the Burgess family, wealthy industrialist Sir James Burgess (Sir Ralph Richardson) and his daughter Patricia (Dame Helen Mirren), who Mick wants to marry, the former who is contemplating investing in the shady dealings in Zingara. Mick will also find that the class struggle not only applies in his case in an upward direction, but also in a downward direction with the working class and the truly down and out. Through it all,Alan Priceand his small combo act as a Greek chorus of sorts providing commentary of Mick's travails through song.—Huggo The film opens with a short fragment outside the plot but clearly related on repeated viewings. Grainy, black-and-white, and silent short, a title ""Once Upon a Time"" leads to Latino laborers picking coffee beans while armed foremen push rudely between them. One worker pockets a few beans (""Coffee for the Breakfast Table"") but is seen by a foreman. He is next seen before a fat Caucasian magistrate who loses some saliva as he removes his cigar only to say ""Guilty."" The foreman pulls his machete and lays it across the unfortunate laborer's wrists, bound to a wooden block, revealing that he is to lose his hands for the theft of a few beans. The machete lifts, descends, and we see the thief draw back in a silent scream. The scene blacks out, the word NOW appears onscreen and expands quickly to fill it.Mick Travis (Malcolm McDowell) is the most promising new sales recruit at Imperial Coffee, a multinational coffee company and distributing factory located somewhere in the UK. His easy manner and winning smile bring him to the attention of the training manager Miss Rowe (Rachel Roberts). When it is learned that a senior salesman in the company has gone missing, Miss Rowe proposes that Mick be recruited to take over his coveted north-east sales sector.After his first successful sale to a large hotel, Mick is invited by the hotel's manager (Arthur Lowe) to attend a private sex club, where Mick makes many valuable contacts, including high ranking government and police figures. On returning to his lodgings, he is contacted by Imperial Coffee and is informed that his sector will be expanded to include all of Scotland, requiring his immediate departure. A tailor (Ralph Richardson) who occupies an adjacent room, gives Mick a suit of golden material as a parting gift. The tailor gives him the following advice: ""Try not to die like a dog.""En route to Scotland, Mick becomes lost and finds himself at the gates of a military facility. He is apprehended by a military detachment and, despite his protestations of innocence, is taken into custody. He is briefly interrogated and tortured by two men in plain clothes (Philip StoneandMichael Bangerter) who apparently believe him to be a foreign spy. To avoid further torture, Mick signs a confession and answers several questions relating to his movements as a spy. When a siren sounds, the two interrogators quickly flee the scene, and Mick is shortly after freed from his restraints by a tea-lady (Dandy Nichols).Mick flees the facility as it gradually engulfed by fire. He makes his way back to his car, which is now also in flames. He retrieves his golden suit from the car shortly before it explodes. Mick makes his way through a blasted and burning landscape. When the clothes he is wearing are ruined by a downpour, he changes into his golden suit. After he has done so, he finds himself in an idyllic pastoral landscape and drinks from a fresh-water stream. He discovers a Christian church where a congregation is singing. Hungry and exhausted, he enters the church and collapses in a pew. When he awakes, the church is empty, but a large quantity of fresh produce has been collected at the altar. He is about to feed himself when he is warned by the vicar's wife (Mary MacLeod) that the food is for God. However, she takes pity on him and feeds him from her own breast.His strength renewed, Mick joyously makes his way back to the road, accompanied by two children. When he reaches the motorway, he decides to head back to London. A car stops for him and asks if he would like to make some quick money by participating in a medical experiment. Mick agrees and is taken to a private clinic run by Professor Millar (Graham Crowden), who performs experimental transplant procedures. Millar informs Mick that his physiognomy is of a rare sort that would be of particular value to their research. Whilst awaiting surgery, Mick sneaks from his room and encounters a post-op patient whose head seems to have been transplanted onto the body of a four-legged animal. On seeing this, Mick flees the clinic in terror.He is next picked up by group of musicians in a van. Inside the van, he discovers a young woman, Patricia (Helen Mirren), hidden under a blanket. He immediately falls in love with her and stays with her on his return to London. Over breakfast, Patricia reveals that her father, Sir James Burgess (Ralph Richardson), is a wealthy copper magnate. Mick decides to insinuate his way into Sir James's company on the pretence that has important information to report on his daughter's welfare. During his interview with Sir James, a disgruntled senior employee (Graham Crowden) commits suicide by jumping from Sir James's office window. Sir James's assistant, in attempting to prevent the suicide, also falls to his death, and Mick is immediately recruited to replace him.Mick's first assignment with Sir James is to attend negotiations with Dr. Munda (Arthur Lowe), president of the African nation of Zingara, who is trying to convince Sir James to establish copper mining operations in his country. As part of the negotiation, Munda requests large quantities of a chemical weapon called ""honey"" to ensure that Sir James's operations will protected from local insurgencies. Mick oversees the delivery of the ""honey"" by the British Air Force to Zingara.A dinner party is held at Sir James's home to finalise the business transaction with Munda. Mick encounters Patricia receiving a marriage proposal by a pathetic English aristocrat (Michael Medwin). Although Mick is incensed, she informs Mick that she may indeed accept the proposal. Sir James offers Munda a large quantity of gold bullion for the right to set up operations in Zingara, but, since the gold must be exported to Zingara illegally, Sir James organises it so that Mick is framed for the crime involved in its delivery. Mick is arrested at the party and brought to court, where he is found guilty and sentenced to five years imprisonment.The prison system in which Mick is incarcerated prides itself on its compassion and its willingness to attend the spiritual and intellectual rehabilitation of its inmates. At the end of his sentence, Mick expresses that he is fully transformed as a human being. Shortly after his release, he encounters a Salvation Army band and offers a large donation from his own limited funds. The band leader (Philip Stone) initially praises Mick's generous spirit, but condemns him when Mick announces that he no longer believes in ""sin"", and that he regards humanity as a united brotherhood. The band and their followers fall to their knees to pray for Mick, who otherwise remains upright and walks away.Mick becomes aware of a disturbance in a nearby neighbourhood. When he investigates, he discovers that a local woman, Mrs. Richards (Rachel Roberts), has barricaded herself in her flat, where she is promising to commit suicide. In an attempt to save her, Mick scales the outside wall of her flat and appeals to her through the window. He assures her that she has every reason in the world to continue living, and he recites various inspirational poetic works to convince her to change her mind. Mrs. Richards, however, remains implacable. Mick falls three storeys to the street below. He is awoken several hours later by a policeman who informs him that Mrs. Richards has completed her suicide.Mick next encounters a mobile soup kitchen. Although he is hungry and destitute himself, he does not accept any food, but rather volunteers to assist the proprietor (Vivian Pickles) in her work. The proprietor eagerly accepts Mick's offer and, giving him a large pot of soup and several paper cups, directs him to distribute it to a community of tramps gathered around a bonfire. As he is distributing the soup, he encounters Patricia, now destitute, cradling an unconscious man in her arms. She recognises Mick and informs him that she accepted the marriage proposal, and indicates that the unconscious figure she is cradling is her husband. The rest of the tramps quickly become hostile towards Mick. They disdain his patronising charity and pelt him with stones.The next morning, Mick encounters a man handing out invitations to an open film audition. Mick attends the audition, where he is singled out by the director (Lindsay Anderson). The director asks him to strike a number of poses for a still photographer. However, when the director asks Mick to smile, Mick asks ""Why?"" and argues that one cannot smile without a reason. The director assaults him in frustration, and Mick struggles to smile with difficulty. Yet, when he finally succeeds in smiling, he is brought to a state of near ecstasy: surrounded by many figures from his own past, happy and reconciled, he dances to upbeat music within a collective brotherhood of humanity."

The Iceman Cometh,1973,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070212/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A salesman with a sudden passion for reform has an idea to sell to his barfly buddies: throw away your pipe dreams. The drunkards, living in a flophouse above a saloon, resent the idea. In 1912, the patrons of 'The Last Chance Saloon' have gathered for their evening of whiskey to contemplate their lost faith and dreams, when Hickey (Lee Marvin) arrives. Hickey is out to convince everyone that he can help them all find peace of mind by ridding them of their foolish dreams and bringing them back to reality. Hickey works especially hard on Larry Slade (Robert Ryan) a former anarchist who has lost his passion for life and is awaiting the eventuality of death. Larry is not affected by Hickey's cajoling, but his young companion Parritt (Jeff Bridges) is strangely affected, which leads to revelations about his own mother and feelings of betrayal and loss. As the night wears on, the mood changes as everyone has the their faith and dreams slowly destroyed by Hickey. As the anger builds, everyone turns on Hickey about his wife and the iceman. This leads to more revelations and Hickey having the faint questioning of his own newfound convictions.—Dr pepper <j0468@aol.com> It is set in Harry Hope's decidedly downmarket Greenwich Village saloon and rooming house, in 1912. The patrons, who are all men except for three women who are prostitutes, are all dead-end alcoholics who spend every possible moment seeking oblivion in each others' company and trying to con or wheedle free drinks from Harry and the bartenders. They tend to focus much of their anticipation on the semi-regular visits of the salesman Theodore Hickman, known to them as Hickey. When Hickey finishes a tour of his business territory, which is apparently a wide expanse of the East Coast, he typically turns up at the saloon and starts the party. He buys drinks for everyone, regales them with jokes and stories, and goes on a bender of several days until his money runs out. As the play opens, the regulars are expecting Hickey to turn up soon and plan to throw Harry a surprise birthday party. The entire first act introduces the various characters and shows them bickering amongst each other, showing just how drunk and delusional they are, all the while waiting for the arrival of Hickey.When Hickey finally arrives, his behavior throws the other characters into turmoil. He insists, with as much charisma as ever, but now lumped together with the zeal of a recent convert, that he sees life clearly now as never before, because he is sober. He hectors his former drinking companions that they are meaninglessly clinging to ""pipe dreams"" of some kind of positive change in their lives, while continuing to drown their sorrows exactly as before. (This is true; the ex-cop and carny hustler tell each other they will ask for their old jobs back on the police force or with the circus, the bartender says he will marry his prostitute girlfriend, etc., with seemingly no chance of any of this coming to pass. One character is even nicknamed Jimmy Tomorrow for his constant protestations.) Hickey wants the characters to cast away their delusions and embrace the hopelessness of their fates. He takes on this task with a near-maniacal fervor. How he goes about his mission, how the other characters respond, and their efforts to find out what has wrought this change in Hickey, take over four hours to resolve. Eventually, after most of the characters briefly leave the bar intending to show Hickey that they actually intend to accomplish their dreams, they all return and are even more upset with Hickey. Hickey, who had earlier told the other characters that his wife had died and that she was murdered, admits that he actually killed her. The police arrive, apparently called by Hickey himself, and Hickey justifies the murder in a dramatic monologue, saying that he did it out of love for her. The other characters conclude that Hickey is insane. Almost everyone remains at the bar. At the end of the play, the youngest character, Don, kills himself."

Cross' superior McLeod is surprised to see both Cross and Scorpio return to DC as the agency, through McLeod, had unofficially contracted Scorpio to eliminate Cross in Paris as it is well known within the agency that Cross plans on quitting, the threat that he could sell out to the Communists with the amount of knowledge he has too great a risk for the agency to take.

The 1800s: scholarly Karl Schiller believes he's found the ring of the Nibelungen, which holds great power. It's at Castle Dracula. His twin, Franz, a gambler, asks if vampires frighten Karl; Karl shows him an Egyptian amulet, which may protect him. Franz takes the amulet and sets out ahead of his brother, arriving at the castle first. There he finds a countess who invites him to dine. Later that night, Karl arrives. Coincidently, it's the Night of the Virgin Moon, a night that falls every fifty years and draws five virgins from the surrounding village to the castle not be heard from again. Can Karl protect his brother, find the ring, and rescue any of the women?—<jhailey@hotmail.com> Karl Schiller [Mark Damon] thinks he may have located Wagner's Ring of Nibelungen
at Castle Dracula in the Carpathian mountains and plans to go looking for
it. Karl's seedy twin brother Franz [also Mark Damon] reminds him that Transylvania is the
land of vampires, but Karl laughs off such superstitious ideas. Besides,
he's got an amulet that will protect him, so he sets off for Transylvania.
However, Franz whips up a swift horse, swipes Karl's amulet, and beats him
to the castle. Franz stops first in the village nearest the castle and
learns from the innkeeper's daughter Tanya [Francesca Romana Davila] that tomorrow night is the
Night of the Virgin Moon, and legend says that every 50 years on the full
moon following Midsummer, five virgins will be chosen from the village and
called to the castle. What happens to them is not known, but they
disappear during the night and are never seen again. After deflowering
Tanya for her own protection, Franz rides on to Castle Dracula where he
meets the occupants--the Contessa Dominga de Vries [Sara Bay] and her zombielike
lesbian housekeeper Lara [Esmerelda Barros]. Unfortunately for Franz, he left the amulet of
protection back at the inn. The Contessa, being a vampire, easily seduces
Franz and turns him into one, too.Along comes Karl, riding his not-so-swift horse. When he shows up at
the castle and identifies himself, the Countess informs him that Franz was
there but left abruptly without a word of thanks, and she doesn't know
where he went. Karl is invited to stay the night, but when he finds
himself locked in his bedroom, he climbs out of the window and goes poking
around the castle. He winds up in the crypt where he is attacked by a
bald-headed vampire [Ciro Papas] and finds his brother sealed in a coffin. Karl
releases Franz and carries him back upstairs, but Franz has no memory of
how he got into the crypt.Meanwhile, Tanya has found the amulet under the pillow in the room
where Franz spent the night, and she decides to bring it to the castle
herself. She sees Karl in the window and, thinking him to be Franz, she
tells him that she has brought his amulet. By the time Karl can get from
his room down to the courtyard, Tanya has disappeared but he does find the
amulet laying on the cobblestones.This being the Night of the Virgin Moon, the Countess is busy
preparing for the ceremony. First, she puts on the Ring of Nibelungen and
uses it to summon the five virgins to the castle. Once there, they are
stripped naked by Lara and prepared to be sacrificed at a Black Mass.
Meanwhile, Franz has come to realize that he is possessed by Dracula, and
the Countess informs him that they are to be married at the Black Mass.
Karl tries to talk Franz out of it, but to no avail. While Lara stabs each
of the virgins in their necks, Franz and Karl fight with each other.
Suddenly, Franz is summoned to take his place at the wedding. The Countess
gives him a knife and orders him to use it on Tanya. Instead, he turns on
Lara and stabs her in the stomach. The Countess sees Franz's reflection in
a mirror and realizes that it is Karl, not Franz, so she points the Ring
of Nibelungen at him and sics her five hooded disciples on him. Karl grabs
an axe and chops off their heads one by one. He is then set upon by the
bald-headed vampire, but Karl grabs a bayonet and stabs the vampire.Tanya has freed herself and gotten away, but she is headed off by the
Countess who uses the Ring to entrance Tanya. The Countess then changes
into a giant bat. Shortly thereafter, Karl comes running, and the Countess
turns the Ring on him, but Karl pulls out his amulet, causing the Countess
to scream in fear. He then wields his axe and cuts off her hand, the one
with the Ring on her finger. Only one more thing to do -- stake Franz and
bury his body along with the amulet -- and Karl is free to ride off with
Tanya. Unfortunately, Tanya has been turned into a vampire, and she bites
Karl. In the final scene, Franz's hand rises from his grave and clutches
the amulet. [Original Synopsis by bj_kuehl.]"

Lemora: A Child's Tale of the Supernatural,1973,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070300/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A young girl who returns to her hometown to see her dying father finds herself being drawn into a web of vampirism and witchcraft. 1930s. Lila Lee [Cheryl ""Rainbeaux"" Smith], the Singin' Angel of the Community Baptist Church of
Tylerville (North Carolina?), is a sweet and innocent 13-year old whose
gangster father Alvin [William Whitton] just shot his wife and her lover, ran down an old
lady in the street, and is now running from the law. Reverend Mueller [Richard Blackburn], who
has a hard time keeping his hands off his ward Lila, has made it clear to
the parish that the sins of her father should not be blamed on Lila, but
when Lila gets a letter from a woman named Lemora, instructing her to come
to her sick father and forgive him his sins against her, Lila makes her
way that very night to the Northpark bus station just in time to catch the
bus (driven by a very creepy bus driver) to Asteroth.Along the road to Asteroth, an isolated little town in the salt
marshes, the bus is pursued by several monstrous-looking ghouls, visible
from outside Lila's window. When the bus breaks down and the bus driver
tries to fix it, the ghouls close in. Lila releases the brake and coasts
down the hill until she crashes into a tree. The ghouls begin to approach
when suddenly they are attacked by vampires (aristocratic-looking with
white faces, long black coats, and top hats). Lila passes out. When she
awakens, she finds herself imprisoned in a stonehouse and tended to by a
weird old lady named Solange [Maxine Ballantyne]. [Lemora later explains that the bars weren't
to keep Lila IN but to keep other things OUT.] Lila manages to escape the
stonehouse and to hide in a crawl space under a porch, where she overhears
Lemora [Lesley Gilb] talking to her father. When a spider lands on her arm, Lila
screams. Lemora finds her, brings her into the house, and prepares a room
for her. Lemora explains that Lila can see her father after the ceremony
tomorrow, when she will become immune to his ""disease.""When Lila explores the old Victorian house and her bedroom in
particular, she sees some very strange things. For example, the mirrors
have no mirrors. There is a plate of raw meat set on Lila's bed as you
would a bowl of candy (Lila helps herself to several pieces). She looks
out the window when she hears screams and sees a young child being forced
into the stonehouse. When she takes out her mirror from her suitcase, she
notices that Lemora casts no reflection in it. Lemora introduces Lila to
her five freaky, ""adopted"" children, all of whom sit down for a repast of
goblets of something that looks like blood (Lila drinks hers).Suddenly, a crash is heard. Everyone runs to the room where the sound
came from, and Lila sees a bed that she assumes was her father's sickbed.
Lemora hurriedly makes the bed, hiding the restraining straps, and
explains that her father's disease occasionally makes him delirious and
that he must have broken loose. He'll be found, she assures Lila, then
tells her to get ready for her bath, during which Lemora attempts to get
the crucifix off Lila's neck, but to no avail. When Lemora leaves the room
for a few minutes, Lila's ghoulish father breaks in and chases her until
Lemora scares him off with fire and Lila flies into Lemora's arms for
protection. Lemora explains that a year ago some of her people began
turning ugly and that it is now necessary to kill them all, including her
father. Lemora then carries a tired Lila upstairs and lovingly puts her to
bed.This is just what Lemora was hoping -- that Lila would come to love
and trust her, unlike Mary Jo Spinks, another 13-year old girl who was a
weakling and couldn't stand her ""love"". When Lila finds Mary Jo's diary,
written in 1892, in which she describes something happening to her that is
so horrible she must kill herself, Lila realizes that she has to get away
from Lemora, too. Dressed in her nightgown, Lila quietly creeps down the
stairs and goes out the front door. Once in the yard, Lila peeks through a
window and sees Lemora drinking the blood from the neck of the young child
that was locked in the stonehouse. Finally coming to the realization that
Lemora is a vampire, Lila screams. Lemora looks up.The chase is on. Lila runs through the trees and is pursed by ghouls.
She hides in the back of a hearse and is delivered to a group of vampires
in Asteroth who also take pursuit. Lila runs in and out of buildings, up
and down stairs, past human bones and corpses, including that of Mary Jo
Spinks, until she takes shelter in an abandoned house. Unfortunately,
Lemora is waiting for her there. Lemora offers to make Lila into her real
self and promises that she won't mutate into one of those ghouls because
of the goodness in her heart. Lila refuses. Out in the streets, the ghouls
and vampires are fighting each other, driving stakes through each others'
hearts. Suddenly, Lila is attacked again by her ghoulish father. Lila pulls the stake from Lemora's
heart, and her father falls on it. Of course, removing the stake from
Lemora brings her back to life. Lemora takes Lila into her arms and
removes the crucifix from around her neck.Meanwhile, the Reverend has been looking for Lila. He passes through
Asteroth and stands in the street shouting Lila's name. For some reason,
he falls asleep. When he awakens, he is lying next to Lila, who is kissing
him. He kisses her back ardently. He looks up into Lila's face and sees
that her teeth have turned to fangs just as she bends forward and bites
his neck. Lemora looks on and smiles.Epilogue [added postproduction]: Lila is still in church, singing ""Rock of
Ages"" to the congregation. [Original Synopsis by bj_kuehl.]"
Anita,1973,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0069718/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Anita is a girl of only teenage years, and while she has developed early physically, to a mature woman, she is emotionally struggling. Her relationship with her parents and her friends is very poor and she is regarded with contempt by the people around her, even by the men who so ruthlessly use her. During her troubles she meets Erik, a young psychology student. Gently and carefully he begins to dispel her psychological blocks. In the course of this treatment she reveals to him some of the shocking episodes of her previous experiences. Erik believes he has the solution to Anita's problems: to let her move into an artist's communal experiment, of which he is already a member. The common interest of this collective is largely the performing of classical music. Anita's presence in the collective, however, is regarded by some of the other girls as highly provocative. Anita's nymphomania is her means of protest against her parents, school, society and her own environment (her whole life situation). He therefore tries to get her to see clearly, and with some insight, the breadth of her psychological situation. Against the background of the intensive battle that Anita carries on with the self-destructive drives within her, grows the depth of feeling that bind her and Erik together. She is no longer simply a ""case"" for him. Anita discovers that Erik is the one man whom she both wants to, and can, remain with.—Stefan Nylen <red@defekt.cinemacabre.se>"

Executive Action,1973,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070046/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Rogue intelligence agents, right-wing politicians, greedy capitalists, and free-lance assassins plot and carry out the JFK assassination. A dramatization about how the high level covert conspirators in the JFK assassination might have planned and plotted the assassination based on the data and facts of the case. It posits that a covert group of rogue intelligence agents, ultra-conservative politicians, unscrupulously greedy business interests, and free-lance assassins become increasingly alarmed at President Kennedy's policies, including his views on race relations, winding down the Vietnam War, and ending the oil depletion allowance. They decide to terminate him through an ""executive action"" utilizing three teams of well-trained snipers during JFK's visit to Dallas and place the blame on supposed CIA operative Lee Harvey Oswald as the lone assassin.—duke1029 Using on-the-record facts as the framework, a fictional account of an organized plot that led to the actual assassination of PresidentJohn F. Kennedyis presented. It's late spring 1963. Harold Ferguson, a wealthy right wing American businessman, laments the possibility of liberally-minded Kennedy's reelection in 1964. As such, he has convened a small group of like minded individuals to devise a strategy for Kennedy not to be reelected. Among the group, the chief strategist is James Farrington, who has done similar work for Ferguson before. Farrington's idea: kill the President sometime before the election. His plan would have the starting point of past assassinations and assassination attempts of Presidents as its basis, all those precedents which were carried out by a lone citizen standing on his own principle, and without experience in military or revolutionary strategy. The plot would be meticulously thought out, but on the surface be made to look like a lone crazed gunman carried out the assassination on his own, that patsy of a person chosen ultimately being a Communist sympathizer namedLee Harvey Oswaldwho would have no idea of the actual plot. The one person who needs to be convinced is Ferguson as the sole financier, he who is an easy sell, admitting that he has authorized homicide in the past to achieve his business goals. As the plot goes into motion, they must ultimately sit back and watch it unfold to see if it happens the way Farrington believes this foolproof plan will unfold.—Huggo Opening scene is set in June 1963 at a gathering of a group of shadowy industrial, political and former US intelligence figures who are giving vent to their growing dissatisfaction with the Kennedy administration. The scene takes place in the plush surroundings of the lead conspirator, Robert Foster (Robert Ryan), presumably a Texas oil baron. He and the others are trying to convince Ferguson (Will Geer), a white-suited and mustachioed figure a powerful oil magnate to back their plans for an assassination of President John F. Kennedy. He remains unconvinced saying ""I don't like such schemes. They're only tolerable when necessary, and only permissible when they work."" James Farrington (Burt Lancaster), a black ops specialist, is also among the group. The film then cuts to somewhere in the desert where a shooting team is doing target practice at a moving object. One of the shooters says that they can only guarantee the operation's success by slowing down the target to 15 mph.The film intercuts between conversations among the lead conspirators, Farrington and Foster, and preparations for the assassination. The approval of the man in the white suit is crucial to the conspirators, although Farrington proceeds to organize two shooting teams in anticipation that he will change his mind.We then see sequences of Ferguson, the man in the white suit, watching contemporary newsreel and becoming clearly concerned at Kennedy's increasingly 'liberal' direction: action on civil rights for black people, Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, nuclear disarmament. The deciding moment comes when he's watching an anti-Kennedy news report on the deteriorating situation in South Vietnam. It is followed by Kennedy's ""suicidal"" October 1963 decision (National Security Action Memorandum #263, Oct. 11, 1963) to withdraw all US advisors from Vietnam by the end of 1965, effectively ending America's direct involvement in the Vietnam War. Ferguson picks up the phone to tell Foster he now fully supports their project.While the motives of the man in the white suit are clear, through dialogues between Foster and Farrington, the film attempts to cast light on the murky paranoid fears of the conspirators about the future of America and the white races. Foster forecasts the population of the third world in 2000 at 7 billion, ""Most of them yellow, brown or black. All hungry and all determined to love; they'll swarm out of their breeding grounds into Europe and America"". He sees Vietnam as an opportunity to control the developing world and reduce its population to 550 million: ""I've seen the data,"" says Foster, adding that they can then apply the same ""birth-control"" methods to unwanted groups in the US: poor whites, blacks and Latinos.The film postulates the same theory as JFK that Lee Harvey Oswald is being steered to become the conspiracy's 'patsy', but unlike JFK, the conspirators use a double of Oswald to shadow him in the weeks leading up to the assassination to leave behind a trail of evidence that the authorities can easily follow and link Oswald alone to the assassination.The film makes no explicit link to US government agencies and the conspiracy, although the professionalism of Farrington's shooting team clearly indicates they have worked for the CIA on special assignments. The film implies that most of the law enforcement and government agencies were not involved in the conspiracy, but they were just grossly inept: no special measures were taken for the president's safety in Dallas; there is no communication between the FBI, CIA, and Secret Service on possible security risks; even the head of the Secret Service stays in Washington during the visit. This explanation helps understand why the authorities were so keen to pin all of the blame on Oswald, the rogue assassin, who is 'served up' by the conspirators to the authorities as an easy escape from any accusations of their own negligence.On November 22, 1963 the assasination is carried out. The post-assassination conspiracy is also covered in the film. Farrington tells the head of the two shooting teams, who at this point don't know who their target is, that after this job he and his men will never have to work again and they can never meet one another ever again. All the assassins are black ops professionals trained never to talk about operations they are involved in. Each one is offered $25,000 per year for the next five years provided the operation's cover isn't blown by 'removing' any people who directly witnessed the assasination of Kennedy. If the cover remains intact in five years time ""every man jack of them"" will receive a further $100,000 into their Swiss bank accounts for another 10 or more years. The head of the shooting teams then tells Farrington: ""You just told me who we're going to hit.""At the end of the film, a photo collage is shown of 18 witnesses: all but two of whom died from unnatural causes within three years of the assassination. A voice-over says that an actuary of the British newspaper The Sunday Times calculated the probability that all these people who witnessed the assassination would die within that period of time to be 100 trillion to one."

The Last American Hero,1973,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070287/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A young hellraiser quits his moonshine business to try to become the best NASCAR racer the south has ever seen. Elroy ""Junior"" Jackson (Jeff Bridges) speeds through the backwoods of rural North Carolina in his Mustang, arriving home to help his father Elroy, Sr. (Art Lund) and brother Wayne (Gary Busey) put their moonshine whiskey into bottles. When the boys joke about a policeman named Collins, their father admonishes them to treat the man with respect. On that night's delivery run, Junior evades arrest by listening to the police on his CB radio and eventually running a roadblock which forces Collins to jump into a watery ditch. The next day, Collins retaliates by blowing up Mr. Jackson's whiskey distillery and arresting him.When Wayne informs Junior that his humiliation of Collins has put their father in prison, Junior goes to the jail with a lawyer, attempting to take responsibility for the incident, but his father stoically accepts his fate. The lawyer advises Mr. Jackson to renounce bootlegging in court to lessen his sentence, but Mr. Jackson refuses on principal, arguing that everyone at city hall drinks his whiskey.The next day, Junior talks to a racing promoter named Hackel (Ned Beatty) about entering the local demolition derby in order to raise money for his father's legal defense. Hackel ridicules the backwoods boy, but Junior persists and is allowed to compete. Junior's brother and friends help him prepare an old car for derby day with a spike to project from the grill so that he can ram his competitors' vehicles, an innovation that excites the crowd and wins him $200.Invited to the next derby, Junior replies that he will enter the stock car race instead and again Hackel scoffs at him. To prove his skill, Junior times himself on the track that night and is so fast that he is allowed to enter. During the race, Junior amazes the crowd with his fearless driving and wins first prize. Afterward, Junior drives to city hall to attend his father's trial, but discovers that the trial has already ended and his father has been sentenced to a year in prison for refusing to denounce moonshine.Unaware that his mother (Geraldine Fitzgerald) is in attendance, Junior wins his eighth race on Hackel's track, which ends with another driver attacking Junior over his aggressive maneuvers. After the fight, Hackel brands Junior a troublemaker and orders him never to return, to which Junior retorts that he is a star and will race at the more prestigious Hickory racetrack.That night, worried about Junior's safety, Wayne and his mother urge him to take a job as a garage mechanic, which he angrily refuses due to the low pay. During Junior's next visit to the jail, when his father tells him that ""one man's foolishness is the breath of life to another,"" Junior realizes that only his father understands him and gives him his trophy.Needing money for a faster car, Junior continues delivering moonshine, now in a truck with a tank that he and Wayne have equipped with a release valve that dumps the whiskey onto the road if the police get too close. However, when the sons proudly tell their father about the invention, he chastises them for antagonizing the police.Junior arrives at the Hickory racetrack to announce to the owner Morley (Gregory Walcott) and racing star Kyle Kingman (William Smith) that he will win the next race, but Morley, who knows Junior's reputation, replies that he has declined Junior's entry. In response, Junior surprises Morley by producing a pit pass and a rule book that states he has a right to qualify.After successfully completing his trial run, Junior goes into the office where he meets Morley's friendly assistant and secretary, Marge Dennison (Valerie Perrine), and thanks her for sending him the pass and rule book. As Junior signs the entry papers, Marge tells him about his motel accommodations and puts his name on the list for the buffet, adding that he can bring a guest. When Junior invites Marge to dinner and she replies that she has a date, he grins and says he does not discourage easily.That evening, when Junior checks into the motel he finds that Marge has gotten him a discount on his room and has flowers delivered to her. As he is getting out of the shower, Junior, wearing only a towel, is flustered when Marge knocks and enters, thanking him for the flowers and flirting while he dresses for dinner.At the buffet and party, Marge dances with Kingman while Junior sees driver Rick Penny (Lane Smith) arguing with his manager, Burton Colt (Ed Lauter). When Penny complains to Junior afterward, Junior disdainfully suggests he work for himself and as Junior drives Marge home, he derides the other drivers as hired jockeys.After dropping Marge off, Junior goes into a recording booth where he makes record for his family, telling them about Hickory and finally apologizing to his father, saying that he loves him, but throws the record in the trash as he leaves. Back in his room, Junior calls Marge and is shocked when Kingman answers, but is later cheered when his friends show him their new team jackets emblazoned with his name.On the day of the race, Junior sees Marge waving from the stands and sadly realizes that she is waving at Kingman. The race begins and Junior pulls ahead with his friends cheering him on, while Penny falls behind as his manager bullies him over a radio. When Junior's car catches fire he is unhurt, but is unable to complete the race, which Kingman wins. Impressed with Junior's driving, Colt takes advantage of the destruction of his car by offering to make him one of his drivers, but Junior refuses to be bought, vowing to get a new car and beat Colt and everyone else.While celebrating Kingman's victory with him, Marge meets his wife, Trina (Erica Hagen), who makes it clear that Marge should end the affair with her husband. Calmly accepting this, Marge turns to Junior and they proceed to her apartment where they have sex for the first time. They are startled when their post-sex romantic conversation is interrupted by Kingman unlocking the door, but Kingman smiles and tosses his key to Junior for future use.Later back home, Mr. Jackson returns from jail after being paroled early for good behavior, but when his sons show him their new underground still, he angrily destroys it, saying he does not want Junior to risk his racing career by bootlegging. When Junior retorts that he needs money for a new car, his father slaps him, saying that Elroy Jackson, Jr. will find a way.Seeing no alternative, Junior offers to drive for Colt in exchange for 50% of the prize money. Colt inflexibly counters with his terms of 30% and demands that Junior wear his uniform, drive his car and use his crew. Junior eventually accepts and begins the Hickory 500 race with Colt coaching him through an earpiece, which Junior soon discards and proceeds to race his own way.Junior and Kingman compete for the lead throughout the grueling contest until Junior finally triumphs. In the winner's circle, Junior is joined by his friends and Colt. As they are celebrating, Marge congratulates Junior and although he is relieved that she is no longer with Kingman, he sadly watches her leave with another driver. When Colt threatens to dock half of Junior's $3,000 prize money for insubordination, Junior grabs the trophy, saying that his racing talent gives him the power in their relationship. Junior then informs Colt that he will continue racing for him only if he can retain 60% of future prize money and use his own car and crew. Colt reluctantly accepts the deal.In the final scene, as his brother and friends enjoy skipping stones at a local pond, Junior walks alone into a press conference as flashbulbs pop and he is asked by the reporters where he, Junior Jackson, is going to race next."
The Reincarnation of Isabel,1973,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0122685/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A group of vampires keep the body of a witch in a castle cellar. They require virgin blood to resurrect her. A party of people arrive and things kick off. In the late-1300s, the beautiful and innocent Isabella is tortured and burned at the stake for supposed witchcraft, in front of her lover who swears revenge. Several hundred years later, the well-off Jack Nelson and his niece, Laureen, celebrate the latter's engagement at their newly-acquired and fully renovated castle, unbeknownst to them that in the château's dank cellar, evil occultists participate in ancient black magic rites, sacrificing youthful virgins. What are their intentions? Is Laureen next in line?—Nick Riganas In the cellar of the local cursed castle, Satanists are cutting out
the hearts and drinking the blood of virgins in order to keep alive their
Great Mistress Isabella Isabella Drupel [Rita Calderoni], a witch/vampire who was staked through the chest
and burned to death in the 14th century. They currently await ""the 25th
moon"", when Isabella (chained to a wall and with a big hole in her chest)
will be able to fully reincarnate in another body. Neither the stories
about the castle being the site of the Inquisition, nor the heartless
village virgins being found all over, nor the fact that some odd occultist [Raoul Lovecchio]
and his servant are also living in the castle, phases Jack Nelson [Mickey Hargitay], the
castle's new owner. In fact, one of the first things Jack does is to throw
an engagement party for niece Laureen [Rita Calderoni] who is marrying a local boy, Richard
Brenton [William Darni].Jack doesn't care about the castle's notoriety because he is actually
Count Dracula, and he's been waiting 500 years for the day when his
beloved Isabella will return to him. He doesn't care about the occultist
either, because it was he who helped remove Isabella's body from the stake
all those years ago. In fact, many of the male guests are also vampires
who have been awaiting Isabella's return, and most of the female guests
are reincarnations of the same girls who were shouting ""Burn the witch!""
all those years ago when Isabella was suffering.[Herein insert a good 45 minutes of scenes with no continuity and
even less sense, mostly of Isabella being staked and burned, the virgins
being seduced by the vampires, Christa [Christa Barrymore] being buried alive and then
returning as a vampire, lots of bare breasts and women being held by the
torturers, and Laureen escaping from a tightening cage of knives and
falling into amnesia about what happened to her.] This kind of stuff goes
on until Richard stumbles upon one of the occultist's books that explains
how Vampires need blood uncontaminated by semen (i.e., from virgins) and
Jack and the occultist explain how everyone there has paid a role, past
and present, in Isabella's death.It is the night of the 25th moon. All the vampires suddenly go on a
feeding frenzy. Two of their victims escape but, while they are running
through the valley clothed only in a black cape, a lightning bolt strikes
a wooden cross and sets it on fire. The villagers see the cross burning
and, like in the old days, start screaming there be witches here. The
villagers attempt to kill the girls, but the occultist suggests that they
be allowed to pass the altar at the crossroads where it is said no demon
can pass without being incinerated. The villagers agree, and the two girls
are promptly engulfed by fire and disappear, reappearing in the castle
cellar where they rejoin the other girls being held as sacrifices to
Isabella. Tired of all the mysteries and disappearing girls, Richard

Despite this, he develops a friendship with his classmate Robin Jones, much to the disapproval of her boyfriend and high school jock, Roger Davis.Late one night after school, Vernon sneaks into the science classroom to feed the class guinea pig Mr. Mumps, whom he has also used as a test subject for a new drug he has created as part of his biology project. However, he discovers that the drug has turned Mr. Mumps into a small, snarling beast, which has killed a cat owned by the school's creepy old janitor, Mr. Griggs. Vernon tries to dispose of the cat's body, but Griggs catches him in the act, and, thinking Vernon responsible, beats him down in a fit of rage, before beating Mr. Mumps to death with a pestle.

Upon doing so, Vernon starts rapidly convulsing, before becoming rabid and violent, following which he kills Mr. Griggs by dunking him into a barrel of sulfuric acid.Despite Vernon's best efforts to dispose of the evidence, Griggs's dissolved remains are found during science class the next day. Lieutenant Bozeman is brought in to investigate, and briefly talks with Vernon to see if he knows anything, but Vernon keeps himself silent about the murder, and so, due to a lack of evidence, Bozeman leaves.Following an English test, Vernon is called over by his wicked English teacher, Mrs. Grindstaff, who tells him that due to his struggling performance in English in comparison to his biology efforts, he will have to attend every literature club meeting for the rest of the semester in order for him to earn a credit high enough for him to be able to graduate. Despite Vernon's protests, since the club meetings coincide with his weekly library visits, Grindstaff ultimately gets him to do so above his wishes. Since the literature club is already happening that night, Vernon goes, but instead spends the meeting's duration in the science classroom, as he brews up another batch of the drug he used on Mr. Mumps and drinks it as the meeting comes to a close. Once everyone else has left, Vernon transforms, and after chasing and terrorizing Grindstaff, ultimately kills her by decapitating her with a paper guillotine.Grindstaff's body is discovered the next morning, and Lieutenant Bozeman is once again brought in.

In exchange, Robin offers Vernon an opportunity to work on her biology project instead, which Vernon agrees to.During a meeting with Coach McCall in the locker room, McCall reprimands Vernon for valuing chemistry and biology over P.E. and all his other subjects. However, he offers him an opportunity for him to be able to skip out on P.E. for the rest of year; since a student of his is struggling in chemistry and needs to pass all his subjects in order to be eligible for a football career, McCall offers Vernon the opportunity to help them out. Vernon goes along with it at first, but is dismayed to learn that the student is none other than his bully Roger, and that he will have to let Roger cheat the exam since it is tomorrow. In response, McCall tells Vernon to give him a call at 10:00pm that night after he has time to make considerations, but specifically tells him to keep their plan a secret.That night, whilst waiting in the school for Vernon's response, McCall suddenly encounters Bozeman and his police squad, who quickly start to suspect him of the murders, but McCall is able to talk himself out of getting arrested. Soon after Bozeman leaves, McCall encounters Vernon, whom has already consumed another batch of the drug.

That night, however, Vernon receives a call from Roger, who tells him that the police have released him due to a lack of evidence. Roger then tells Vernon that he saw Vernon sneaking into the chemistry lab the night of his arrest, and threatens to frame him unless he meets up with him at the school in an hour. Vernon reluctantly agrees.Upon arriving at the school, Vernon brews yet another batch of the drug, and drinks it, only to be scared off by the sound of someone at the classroom window. Believing it to be Roger, Vernon flees, only to run into Robin, whom warns him about Roger since she thinks he plans to kill Vernon. However, Vernon then reveals that he was the murderer, and apologizes to Robin, only to once again transform and chase her throughout the school. He eventually catches up to her, but rather than killing her, breaks down into tears. However, Bozeman and his police squad then show up and start firing at Vernon, who flees and jumps out the window. Outside, he encounters Roger, whom he starts beating to the ground, only for the police squad to show up and shoot Vernon to death. The movie ends with Robin mourning over Vernon's body."

Stranded at the foot of the Carpathians after a bloody accident at the infamous Borgo Pass, a quintet of passengers--four young women and a man--seek shelter in the latest acquisition of eccentric Dr Wendell Marlowe: a cavernous former sanatorium. Now, the guests have no other option but to spend the night in the cold, rumour-ridden castle; however, it is not before long that, one after another, they fall under the spell of their courteous, cryptic host. But, if the hair-raising legend of vampires is true, what will it take to rid the land of Count Dracula's unholy stigma?—Nick Riganas In the beginning of the Eighteenth Century, the Germans Senta, Karen, Elke, Helga are traveling through Spain with Imre Polvi in a carriage pulled by four horses. Imre is secretly dating Marlene and was born in the local. He tells to the group about the nearby derelict Clinic Krakos on the top of the hill that belonged to a notorious vampire, and tells also that an English doctor has just bought the place. When the carriage loses one wheel and the coachman dies hit by one horse, the group seek for shelter in the clinic, and the gentle doctor welcomes them. They learn that they need to wait for one week to have another transportation. What they do not know is that the gentle doctor is indeed the notorious Count Dracula, who expects that a virgin falls in love with him to increase his power to bring his daughter back to life.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil When their carriage loses a wheel while traveling over the Borgo
Pass, the five stranded passengers, Imre Polvi [ Vic Winner] and four young women --
Karen [Kaydee Politoff], Senta [Rosanna Yanni], Marlene [Ingrid Garbo], and Elke [Mirta
Miller] -- are forced to seek refuge at the Klinik
Dr Kargos. It was near here, Imre explains to the girls, that Jonathan
Harker and Professor van Helsing finally put an end to the king of the
vampires, Count Dracula. The sanitarium once held the laboratories of Dr
Kargos, who was hanged for his unsavory research in blood studies. It has
recently been purchased by an Austrian physician, Dr Wendell Marlow [Paul Naschy], who
is agreeable to putting up the travelers until supplies arrive in a week
and they can hitch a ride back to Bistritz.The first night in the somewhat rundown sanitarium (Marlow is having
difficulty hiring local workers) seems to go well. Karen and Senta share a
room while Elke, Marlene, and Imre have their own rooms, although Imre
finds his way to Marlene's bedroom for a little lovemaking. When Karen
leaves her room to close a window banging in the storm, she runs into a
vampire, but Marlow returns her to her bed, assuring both Karen and Senta
that it must have been a tramp taking refuge from the bad weather. The
next day Marlene and Imre go off alone while the other girls swim in the
pool and explore the sanitarium, ending up in a library where they find an
old book about Dracula's immortality that foretells a time when a true
virgin will fall in love with Dracula and give herself to him willingly.
When this happens, Dracula will be restored to his full power and will
rule mankind for all eternity, and his daughter Radna will also be
awakened.The second night, as Imre makes his way to Marlene's room again, he
is attacked and bitten by the vampire/tramp. When Imre finally makes it to
Marlene's room, he bites her, too. Meanwhile, Karen can't sleep, so she
leaves her bedroom and finds Marlow sitting in a chair, reading. Since
Marlow has been gone all day (checking his traps, he says), they take a
stroll together and talk about his lonely life. The next morning, the
girls notice that Marlene and Imre have disappeared but chalk it up to
them going off together and getting lost in the forest. The girls spend
the day looking for them, until Senta gets her foot caught in one of
Marlow's traps. When they return to the sanitarium, Marlow begins to clean
up the blood but then relinquishes the duty to Karen so that he can get
some disinfectant.During the night, Marlene bites Elke's neck. Senta wakes up and pokes
her head outside her bedroom door. She sees Marlow walking down the hall.
Senta has had the hots for Marlow since the day they arrived, so she
invites him into her bed and he is all too happy to join her, although he
does lecture her afterwards about how they shouldn't have done this.
Besides, Senta is not a virgin. Meanwhile, Imre tries to put the bite on
Karen, but her scream brings Marlow running. Marlow bests Imre and tosses
him out the window. Imre falls on a stick of some sort and is impaled.
Suddenly, Karen is attacked by the vampire/tramp. Marlow fights with him,
but the tramp seems to be getting the best of Marlow, until Marlow catches
up with him and drives a stake through his heart. Karen cowers in Marlow's
arms and reveals that she's in love with him. Marlow promises that they
will leave tomorrow.When Karen wakes up, Marlow is gone. She goes in search of him and
hears him calling her. She follows his voice into a chamber of coffins and
finds Marlene, Elke, and Senta (who has now become a vampire) waiting for
her. Marlow reveals himself as Dracula and tells Karen of his plan to use
her to cause his final rebirth along with the rebirth of his daughter
Radna, then he cuts Karen's neck and drinks her blood. With the first
ceremony completed, he imprisons Karen to wait until the next full moon
when they will perform the second ceremony.When the next full moon comes around, the three vampiresses kidnap a
virgin from the village and whip her until her blood flows. Then they hang
her upside down over Radna's coffin and slit her neck. At the same time,
they slit Karen's wrist so that Karen's blood will mingle with the
innocent virgin's blood, both combining to give life to Radna. After going
through all that in order to awaken Radna, however, Dracula/Marlow
decides, out of love for Karen, not to awaken Radna and has her coffin
tossed in a lake. He stakes Senta through the heart and hangs Marlene and
Elke out in the sun to fry. But, when Dracula/Marlow asks Karen to
renounce her mortal life and unite with him, Karen refuses, so he thrusts
a stake through his own heart and turns to dust. Alone now, Karen begins
the long walk over the mountains to Bistritz.Original Synopsis by bj_kuehl."

The executioners then behead Aleric, burying head and body separate from each other. Mabille is tortured and slain while hanging upside down from a tree.Paris, modern day: When Hugo de Marnac [Paul Naschy] and Maurice Roland [Vic Winner] , along with girlfriends Sylvia [Betsabé Ruiz] and Paula [Cristina Suriani], are invited to one of Madame Irina's seances, Hugo decides to humor everyone and ask Mme Irina [Elsa Zabala] to summon his dead ancestor Aleric in order to find out where his head and body are buried. Much to everyone's surprise, Madame Irina is successful. Aleric appears and informs them that his body is buried in the cloisters, and his head is in a crypt in the monastery, both on Hugo's land near the mountain village of Lechat. So, Hugo, Maurice, Sylvia, and Paula decide to make the trip in order to see if they can find Aleric's remains. While driving in the mountains, they are tricked into stopping their car to help a man lying wounded in the road. The man turns out to be an escaped criminal, and he and his friend are looking for a car in which to get away. Unfortunately, they don't get very far before they drive the car head on into the mountainside and destroy the radiator. Luckily, some locals come along, shoot the criminals, and sell Hugo an old, beat-up Citroen for 3,000 francs so that they can continue on to Hugo's chalet.After arriving at the chalet and settling in, the caretaker Gastone [Juan Cazalilla], along with two hired hands from the village, takes Hugo and Maurice to the cloisters, even though local rumor has it that strange things have happened there and that ""a demon walks about."" While digging in the yard where it is rumored that a treasure is buried, Maurice suddenly gets a feeling and leads the group directly to the spot where they dig up a chest. Unable to get the chest open, they take it back to the chalet. Later that night, the two hired men sneak into the chalet and break open the chest, only to find a piece of paper with the word ""Astarothe"" painted on it. When Gastone finds them raiding the chest, one of the villagers, Alain [Luis Ciges], picks up a handsickle and, as though in a trance, slays Gastone and the other villager. Hearing Gastone's cry, his daughters Chantal [Maria José Cantudo] and Elvira [Emma Cohen] go looking for him. Finding their father dead, the girls wake up Hugo. Hugo and Maurice go to help Gastone and notice that the chest is gone. In fact, Alain has taken it into the monastery.When they realize that they are trapped in the chalet high in the mountains (no phone, no lights, no gasoline) with provisions for only four more days, the villagers angry with them for stirring up the demons, and a crazed murderer running about, Hugo and Maurice go looking for a way to get down from the mountain. Meanwhile, Alain starts picking off the girls. First to have her throat cut is Chantal, but Alain doesn't stop there. He cuts out her heart, too. Then he captures Paula and carries her off. Maurice goes looking for Paula and hears her calling him. When Maurice later returns to the chalet, seemingly in a trance, he slugs Sylvia and carries her body to where Aleric's head is alive and well. Aleric's head then tells Maurice to dig out his body as well as Mabille's. After reuniting Aleric's head with his body, Maurice places Sylvia's body in Mabille's tomb. Aleric then slices open Sylvia's chest. As her blood mixes with Mabille's remains, Mabille is reconstituted. Maurice then kills Alain, cuts out his heart, and presents it to Aleric and Mabille.Elvira and Hugo, the only two left alive in the chalet, go looking for a talisman that Gastone used to protect against demons.

Apparently, it doesn't work against the living dead, for when Hugo and Elvira are attacked during the night by the corpses of Gastone, Chantal, Sylvia, and the dead thief, Hugo and Elvira are forced to build a fire to keep them away. The next morning, Maurice suddenly shows up, explaining that he's been wandering about looking for Paula. Hugo asks Maurice to help him dig up and burn the corpses that attacked them last night, but when they go looking for the bodies, Maurice kills Hugo with a shotgun. Maurice then goes after Elvira, but the spell over him is dissipated when he touches the talisman.Elvira and Maurice promise to destroy Aleric and Mabille. Meanwhile, Mabille is getting hungry, so she and Aleric attack some villagers and eat some more hearts. Seven moons have passed, and Aleric and Mabille are preparing for a ritual which will return them to full power. While Paula lures Maurice and the talisman away from Elvira, Aleric enters the chalet. Fortunately, Maurice returns before Aleric has a chance to do anything to Elvira. As Maurice taunts Aleric with the talisman, Mabille kills Paula and then goes after Elvira. Maurice tosses the talisman at Aleric, setting him smoking, as Aleric buries an ax in Maurice's chest. Elvira stabs Mabille with a silver needle. Elvira then picks up the talisman, touches it to Aleric's forehead, and Aleric's head separates from his body. Elvira burns all the bodies and tosses the talisman into the lake.

When Professor Bolton [Mariano Garcia], an archeologist doing research on Vampire Island (somewhere between Africa and India), is killed, his son Chris [Andrew Prine] comes to the island to bury his father, something not easily done since the professor's body is pinned under several tons of tomb. The tomb belongs to Hannah, fiance of King Louis VII. Legend has it that Hannah became a vampire and that Louis sealed her alive in the tomb such that, should the tomb ever be opened before the return of Christ, Hannah would rise again. Chris is met at the dock by Peter [Mark Damon], a grad student doing research on the Crusades, which is also what brought Louis and Hannah to Vampire Island in the first place. Peter, along with his sister Mary [Patty Sheppard], has been living on the island, and Peter seems to be the only inhabitant not fettered by the vampire superstition. However, Peter is actually the one responsible for the professor's death, arranged as a ploy to get Chris Bolton to the island so that the heavy tomb could be moved and Hannah released.Together, Chris and Peter rig up a hoist to lift the tomb off the body of the professor. In doing so, the first thing they lift is the lid, which reveals Hannah's body, as fresh and beautiful as if she were alive. Probably a vaccuum, explains Peter, or a lost embalming technique.

Before he can do the deed, however, Abdul and Adnan are both murdered by the Wild Man [Ihsan Gedik].

Hannah works on his mind until Chris ends up removing the garlic and dogbane. Hannah is now free to leave her tomb. When Chris regains his senses and sees that Hannah is gone, he rounds up the villagers to find her. While they search, Mary goes looking for Chris but instead finds her brother chanting Latin over Hannah's empty tomb. Chris, looking for Mary, also stumbles upon Peter's invocations for immortality.

The villagers catch up with Peter and Hannah just in time to drive a stake through Peter, but Hannah turns to mist and disappears. She shows up in the graveyard where Chris is taunting her to come and get him. She subdues Chris, and just as she is about to take his blood, Mary tosses the wreath of garlic and dogbane onto Hannah's back, causing her to turn into the shewolf and run away. Chris pursues, but Hannah finds him first. To protect himself, Chris tosses his lantern at her. Hannah catches fire, falls off the cliff, and Chris and the villagers finish her off.

Tenderness of the Wolves,1973,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070957/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Using his status as a police informant to procure his victims, baby-faced, shaven-headed Fritz Haarmann dismembers their bodies after death and sells the flesh to restaurants, dumping the remainder out of sight. In 1925, in Germany, Fritz Haarmann is a homosexual, thief and sneak, having a special license from the police. He sells meat in the black market. He also kills boys and young men, drinking their blood, quarter-sewing their bodies and throwing away the parts in a river. Certainly what he sells in the black market is human meat.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Fritz Haarmann, aka the Butcher of Hanover and the Vampire of Hanover, was a German serial killer responsible for the murders of two dozen boys and young men during the so-called 'years of crisis' between the wars. His case would partly inspire Fritz Lang's M, and its central character portrayed by Peter Lorre, as well as this forgotten gem from 1973. Tenderness of the Wolves treats the viewer to a few weeks in the company of a killer. Baby-faced and shaven-headed, in a manner that recalls both M and F.W. Murnau's Nosferatu, Haarmann is a fascinating, repulsive figure. Using his status as a police informant to procure his victims, he dismembers their bodies after death and sells the flesh to restaurants, dumping the remainder out of sight. This isn't an easy film to watch, but it certainly gets under the skin - Produced byRainer Werner Fassbinder(who also supplies a shifty cameo), Tenderness of the Wolves provided two of his regular actors with a means of expanding their careers. Ulli Lommel - later responsible for the infamous video nasty The Boogeyman - made his directorial debut, whileKurt Raabwrote the screenplay as well as delivering an astonishing performance as Haarmann."

Curse of the Devil,1973,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070603/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A man whose ancestors executed a witch is turned into a werewolf by modern-day descendants of the executed witch. Great Inquisitor Ireneus Daninsky has Countess Bathory burned alive and her female followers hanged. Before perishing in the flames, the countess puts a curse on Daninsky and his descendants. Four centuries later, Waldemar Daninsky accidentally shoots a gypsy while hunting a wolf. The angry gypsies, who knew of the curse, summon Satan, and the beautiful Ilona is chosen to seduce the young lord. During a night of love, Ilona bites Waldemar, who turns into a werewolf and kills prey on full-moon nights. His murders are at first attributed to a mad killer who has escaped from the asylum. Waldemar, who suspects the killer is none other than himself, falls in love with Kinga, the daughter of a professor from Budapest. When Maria, Kinga's jealous younger sister, manages to seduce Waldemar and sleep with him, she is killed by the young man when he turns into a werewolf again.—Guy Bellinger Prologue: It is medieval Transylvania. Irineus Daninsky has just slain
Lord Bathory, head of a coven of witches and worshippers of Satan. His widow
Elizabeth is holding a Black Mass in order to exact revenge when Daninsky and
his troops crash the ceremony. Later, as the witches are all hung and Elizabeth
is burned at the stake, she curses Daninsky. One of Daninsky's descendants will
accidentally kill one of the Bathory descendants and set in motion a curse
which will bring hell on earth to all succeeding generations of Daninskys.Many generations later, Waldemar (the last remaining Daninsky) [Paul Naschy] is out in
the forest hunting a wolf when he accidentally shoots a man (actually a
werewolf). This sets in motion the curse, initiated by the man's family of
gypsies, who select one of them, Ilona [Ines Morales], to infiltrate Daninsky's home and make
him fall in love with her. One night, as Waldemar is traveling through the
Borgo Pass on his way to Bistritz, his carriage comes upon a Ilona lying
in the road. Waldemar cares for her at his castle until she is well. Waldemar's
maid Malitza [Ana Farra] warns that Ilona is up to no good, but Waldemar has already taken
her as a lover. On the eve of Walpurgis, Ilona takes a knife and a wolf's skull
from her things, calls upon the dreaded Grey Shadow, slits her own wrist
baptizing the wolf skull with her blood, and then presses the fangs of the wolf
into Waldemar's chest, just above his left breast. Ilona then runs from the
castle, where she is presently chopped up by the ax of insane murderer Janos
Villeya, who has escaped from police custody and gone into hiding on Daninsky's
land.Some days later, as Waldemar is recuperating from his wound and suffering
emotionally from the betrayal and loss of Ilona, he learns that an engineer
named Laszlo Wilowa [Eduardo Calvo] from Budapest has just moved into the area, along with his
blind wife Irina and their two daughters, Kinga and Maria. One day, as Waldemar
is hunting for rabbit, he comes upon Kinga hanging from a cliff and crying for
help. Waldemar helps her down, meets her family, including her precocious
younger sister Maria. As the days pass, Waldemar finds that he is enjoying
Kinga's company. Meanwhile, Kinga is falling in love with Waldemar.One afternoon, Waldemar receives a note from Kinga [Fabiola Falcon] in which she asks him
to meet her at an abandoned cottage near the mill. Just as Waldemar arrives,
she is attacked by the insane murderer. Fortunately, Waldemar saves her,
stabbing Janos in the stomach. As Janos runs off, Waldemar turns to Kinga, only
to find that it is Maria [Maritza Olivares]. In an effort to upstage her older sister, Maria has
decided to give her virginity to Waldemar. Waldemar tries to resist but, when
Maria disrobes, he sweeps her into his arms. They make love, until the full
moon rises and Waldemar suddenly changes into a werewolf and kills Maria.
Malitza, who has been watching, drags Maria's body into the woods and leaves it
to be found as yet another of Janos's victims.Meanwhile, the mark of the werewolf (a red pentagram) has made its
appearance on Waldemar's breast, and he has been changing into a werewolf on
the nights of the full moon, during which he unknowingly kills some villagers.
On the very night that Kinga tells Waldemar that she is pregnant, Waldemar
kills her father. Blame for the killings has so far fallen on the escaped
murderer, whom some say is a werewolf. Finally, Malitza explains to Waldemar
what has been happening and tells him about the curse. Malitza promises to take
care of it, so she reveals the truth to Kinga and gives her a silver dagger.One night, some children playing ball discover Janos's body in an advanced
state of decomposition. It becomes apparent to everyone that someone else has
been doing the killing, and all eyes turn to Waldemar when they remember how he
was marked by Ilona on the night of Walpurgis. The villagers decide to storm
the castle and kill Waldemar. As the villagers, with their guns and torches and
dogs, close in on Waldemar, Kinga gets to him first and stabs him through the
heart with the silver dagger.Epilogue: Five or six years have passed since Waldemar's death. Kinga and
her son visit his grave, and we are reminded of Elizabeth Bathory's curse --
that it will extend to all of Waldemar Daninsky's descendents.Original Synopsis by bj_kuehl."

What they don't know is that the town is completely inhabited by vampires. A group of workers is traveling by bus to the town of Bojoni to work for an aristocratic family. The driver has a fulminating heart attack, and the group decides to drive to the near village of Tolnio instead, to spend the night and follow to Bojoni on the next morning. They find nobody in the apparently ghost city, but in the next morning, they meet the hospitable dwellers. Their bus has a problem in the engine, and they have to stay in Tolnio. Sooner they find that they are trapped in a vampire village.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Seven very tired passengers -- Ernesto [Indio González], Godo [Luis Ciges], Cesar [David Aller], Marcos [Manuel de Blas], Alma [Dianik Zurakowska],
Raquel [Charo Soriano], and Raquel's eight year old daughter Violet [Sarita Gil] -- are traveling by
bus to Bojoni (filmed in Spain) where they have secured jobs working for
an aristocratic family. Suddenly, the bus driver suffers a heart attack.
After moving the dead driver to the back of the bus, Ernesto takes the
wheel. When a road sign indicates that Bojoni is 110 Km, while the town of
Tolnia is only 10 Km, the group decides to get dinner and lodging for the
night in Tolnia before continuing to Bojoni in the morning. When they
arrive in Tolnia, however, there is not a soul to be seen, except for
Luis [Jack Taylor], an American traveler who arrived in Tolnia about an hour ago and has
been walking around the village looking for someone...anyone.The fire in the village tavern is warm and the shelves are stocked
with liquor, so the travelers help themselves and decide to rest in the
inn's bedrooms while Ernesto stays in the tavern in case someone shows up.
As the hours pass and the clock strikes midnight, Ernesto goes out to
check on the bus and discovers that the dead driver is missing. As he
walks around the village looking for the driver, Ernesto is attacked by
some ghoulish villagers intent on drinking his blood.In the morning, the travelers awaken to a breakfast of rolls and hot
coffee. All the villagers have returned, including ""Major"" Boris [José Guardiola], the
village mayor. The Major apologizes and explains that the villagers were
at the cemetery yesterday, paying their respects to a recently-deceased,
but well-loved, villager. The Major graciously extends the village's
hospitality to the travelers, even serving them a delicious roast before
they leave for Bojoni. Unfortunately, when they go to leave, the bus won't
start. Danged if Luis's car has the same problem. Looks like they'll have
to stay on for a few days until they can get help from Bojoni. Marcos
makes it clear that they don't have the money to pay for their food and
keep, but the Major assures them that they will be taken care of
comfortably by the Countess. And so they are. Every day, they are served
luscious meat dishes. What they don't know is that the Countess [Helga Liné] has
ordered that various villagers give up parts of their body in order to
feed the visitors.The Countess, like everyone else in the village, is very eager to
have the travelers remain in town for a few days, enjoying the village's
hospitality at her expense. She is so thrilled at having ""persons who get
around"" that she invites Cesar, the well-read professor, to remain at her
house that evening in order to recite to her from the works of
Shakespeare, Browning, and O'Neill. Part of her hospitality includes
taking Cesar to her bed, but she's not after sex; it's Cesar's blood she
wants. After drinking her fill, the Countess tosses his body over the
veranda to the hungry villagers below.Meanwhile, back at the tavern, Luis is busying himself peeping on
Alma through a hole he discovered in his wardrobe. Marcos and Godo are
summoned by Ernesto to see something in the bus but fall prey to the
vampires. The next morning, Luis notices that the bus is missing, begins
to get suspicious, and starts planning out a means of escape. Violet is
playing hide-and-seek with a boy [Fernando Romero] she has befriended when she witnesses the
arm of the ax grinder being chopped off, but she says nothing. A nice
dinner is served that evening, but Alma is very upset when she finds a
finger on her plate. A bit later, Raquel tells Violet to stay in their
room while she goes to talk with Marcos, but Violet's boy friend persuades
her to come out and play anyway. He leads her into the cemetery. When the
vampires come out, he tries to hide Violet but ends up smothering her.
Raquel has returned to her room and found Violet missing, so she goes
looking for her daughter. Unfortunately for Raquel, she encounters the
villagers, along with Cesar, Ernesto, Godo, and Marcos, who fall prey upon
her.That night, Luis and Alma make their escape. Of course, they are
pursued by the village people, but they finally manage to make it to
Bojoni. The Bojoni police cannot find Tolnia on the map, but they drive
back with Luis and Alma to check out their claim. Lo and behold, there is
nothing there, except for the wrecked bus. [Original Synopsis by bj_kuehl.]"
Malatesta's Carnival of Blood,1973,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0215960/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A family infiltrates a sinister carnival where their son mysteriously disappeared. The Norris family get jobs working at a seedy old carnival as a cover for searching for their missing son who disappeared after visiting said carnival. Eccentric manager Mr. Blood turns out to be a vampire while the evil owner Malatesta rules over a gaggle of ghastly ghouls who watch silent movies when they aren't feasting on human flesh.—Woodyanders Vena Norris (Janine Carazo) is a young woman working in a small, rundown amusement park. She and her mother (Betsy Henn) and father (Paul Hostetler) live in their RV on the park's grounds, where they attend to various rides and games. What the Norris family are really doing, however, is searching for Vena's brother, Lucky (Sebastian Stuart), who disappeared after visiting the park. The ""carnival"" is run by a man known as Mr. Blood (Jerome Dempsey), who works for the park's owner, a tall, thin man known as Malatesta (Daniel Dietrich).Vena has a flirtation with a young coworker named Kit (Chris Thomas), even though she has a boyfriend at home named Johnny (Paul Townsend). Vena talks to Johnny on the phone and they discuss Johnny coming to visit. Her sense of foreboding about being at the park is intensified after an ominous card reading by the park's fortune teller, Sonja (Lenny Baker), which distresses Sonja greatly. Kit is also suspicious of the park's true nature due to local gossip, and an incident where a mother and father take their young daughter through a ""tunnel of love"" indoor boat ride and are not on board when the boat returns. Kit walks into the ride to search for them and finds only the father's now-shattered eyeglasses, along with traces of blood.Mrs. Norris begs her husband to leave the carnival, but he insists that they stay until they find out what happened to their son. In a flashback sequence, we see what actually happened to Lucky; he and his friend visit the park at night and he is decapitated by the roller coaster. When the friend approaches Mr. Blood to ask for help, Blood directs him to the park's deranged custodian (William Preston), who impales him with a litter sticker pole. Severely injured, the boy is taken into the tunnels beneath the park, where he is hung on a transport and delivered to a disheveled crowd of ghoulish looking people, who sing hymns while Blood (now revealed to be a vampire) connects the boy to equipment that drains his blood. As he convulses, the ghouls eat him alive.In addition to Sonja, a carnival co-worker named Bobo (Herve Villechaize) says ominous things in rhyme to an increasingly distressed Vena, who brings Kit into the investigation. The two of them meet surreptitiously at night, but are menaced by the Sticker, who chases them into hiding. When they attempt to escape the park, Kit is deterred by an electrified fence, so they retreat. Vena falls asleep in the RV, but she dreams she is exploring the park. These scenes are cut together with images of the ghouls in the tunnels beneath watching silent movies projected on a wall (Lon Chaney in ""Phantom of the Opera"" and ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame"", specifically). Vena is drawn into the tunnels, where she finds all the strange artifacts assembled there by the underground dwellers: swinging beds made from old car parts, yards of plastic sheeting and bubble wrap, weird shelters adorned with leftover signs and figures from carnival attractions. Overseen by Malatesta and Bobo, she finds herself wading through the crowd of ghouls, who grab at her and pelt her with popcorn. She runs out of the tunnels to find Kit and discovers his dead body on the Ferris wheel. Meanwhile, Mr. Norris awakens and discovers that Vena is gone, her sleeping figure in the dark top bunk revealed to be only a carnival figurine. Ignoring the protests of his wife, Mr. Norris goes out after her, armed with a handgun. After he's gone, Mrs. Norris is chased back into the camper by a horde of ghouls.Elsewhere, Vena tries to call for help from a phone booth, but is chased off by the Sticker. She gets the upper hand and bludgeons him with a board, but ends up fainting in a tunnel, where she is found by Blood. Mr. Norris, still searching for her, is hounded by ghouls in the tunnels beneath the park.Meanwhile, Johnny arrives at the carnival looking for Vena and the others, encountering the strange characters who inhabit the place. Vena is awakened in the tunnels by Blood, who tells her he intends to lead her to safety, where Johnny is waiting. As they walk through the tunnels, he explains to her about the underground area's strange cannibalistic inhabitants, most of them having never seen the light of day. Instead of leading her to safety, Blood takes her to a laboratory and straps her to a table, draining some of her blood into a bottle from which he drinks. Malatesta arrives, however, having told Blood that he is not to touch Vena, and he punishes Blood by revealing his 'true face', which causes Blood to immediately collapse, screaming. Malatesta carries the unconscious Vena into another tunnel and places her on a roller coaster next to Blood's lifeless corpse. He sends the ghouls after Mr. and Mrs. Norris, both of them now in the tunnel looking for Vena. Mrs. Norris is separated from her husband and confronted by ghouls, who eat her alive. Mr. Norris ends up in a hall of mirrors, where Malatesta stabs him in the eye with a sword.Johnny reappears, sneaking up behind Malatesta and throttling him, but realizes that Malatesta has suddenly transformed into a dummy made of bubble wrap.

In 1835, the San Cristobal Island located somewhere in the British West Indies is ruled by sadistic beauty, Lady Susan Walker, who forces the local men to join the black slaves on her sugar cane plantation and either work or die. She's always dressed in black and never lets go of her whip, the black snake. Her latest husband has gone missing making her a real black widow. Her right hand man, impotent, racist and violent Joxer Tierney, is in command of the slaves and he makes sure that they hate him even more than they do her. Young slave Joshua plans a revolt, but his religious father Isaiah is terrified of what might happen if the revolt fails. Sir Charles Walker, the brother of Susan's late husband, goes undercover as Ronald Sopwith to investigate what really happened to his brother. She hires him as the plantation accountant, gives him a black sex slave named Cleone and eventually tries to seduce him. Her sadistic gay assistant may no more about Charles' brother's fate. In 1835, on the island of San Cristobal in the British West Indies, former London Soho prostitute Lady Susan Walker (Anouska Hempel) has achieved wealth and power through her multiple marriages, and now runs her Blackmoor sugar cane plantation with ruthless severity. Susan's favorite possession is her whip, which she calls a ""black snake."" Also fond of whipping the slaves is her sometime lover, an older Irishman named Joxer Tierney (Percy Herbert). Susan's private army of mercenaries is led by the snobbish, homosexual Capt. Raymond Daladier (Bernard Boston), who, because he is a French soldier, disdains the slaves even though he is also black. The disgruntled slaves look to their hot-tempered compatriot Joshua (Milton McCollin) for leadership, and although he urges them to revolt, Joshua's Bible-quoting father, Isiah, counsels patience.Meanwhile, in England, Sir Charles Walker (David Warbeck) asks his patron, Lord Clive (Anthony Sharpe), to help him obtain employment at Blackmoor. Charles explains that he will pretend to be a lowly Cockney bookkeeper in order to investigate the presumed death of his brother Jonathan, Susan's most recent husband, who he believes was murdered by Susan. Charles soon arrives at San Cristobal, where, with his upper-class accent disguised and using the name Ronald Sopwith, he obtains the desired position.On the day of Charles' arrival, Joshua helps fellow slave Barnaby attempt to escape, but an informant alerts Joxer and Barnaby is pursued by the overseer and Raymond's men. Surprised by the violence, Charles tries to help Barnaby, who, terrified of the mercenaries, swims into the ocean, where he is eaten by a shark.On the beach, Charles meets Susan, who approves of his good looks and intimates that she will replace Joxer with him. Disgruntled, Joxer takes Charles to his lodgings and gives him Cleone (Vikki Richards), a pretty slave who is to serve Charles in every way. Joxer hopes to undermine Charles' position with the racist Susan, as he knows how she hates it when her lovers sleep with the slaves.Later the next evening, Charles is having sex with Cleone when he questions her about Jonathan, whom she calls a ""duppie,"" or zombie, explaining that sometimes after a man dies he continues to walk the earth. Their tryst is interrupted by Raymond, who tells Charles that he has been summoned by Susan. Despite Cleone's pleas that he not go, Charles proceeds to the main house, where Susan flirtatiously tells him about her deceased husbands and shows him the grand mansion. She offers herself to him but cautions that he must choose between her and Cleone. Scoffing at Charles' Cockney accent, Susan then reveals her own humble origins, and Charles, assuming his real accent, concocts a story of leaving his English estates because he impregnated his gamekeeper's daughter. Their lovemaking is interrupted by the drunken, ranting Joxer. Joxer knocks Charles out and is raping Susan when the duppie appears and tosses Joxer aside.After Charles jumps on the doper, he realizes that the groaning, unkempt behemoth is his brother. Upon hearing his name, Jonathan runs away, with Charles in pursuit. Raymond finds the two men and, as Jonathan swims away, the Frenchman warns Charles to forget what he has seen and promises not to tell Susan that Jonathan is his brother if he will not reveal that Raymond failed to kill him.The next day, Charles and Joxer clash when Joxer is brutalizing a slave in the fields and Charles rips the whip from his hands. They are about to fight when Raymond appears and reprimands them for disagreeing in front of the slaves. Joxer laughs at Raymond's infatuation with Charles, and their quarrel is heightened when Joxer threatens to whip Charles for preventing him from beating an injured Isiah. Susan interferes, stating that no white man can be whipped unless she does it. Susan orders Charles to whip Isiah or be fired, and after Charles reluctantly picks up the whip, Joshua steps forward, insisting that he be punished instead. When Charles attempts to stop Susan from lashing both men, Joxer knocks him down.Later that night, Susan tells Charles that the black snake will become an extension of his arm as he grows accustomed to the island's violence. As they talk, Joshua sneaks in and puts a large snake into her bathtub, although Charles and Raymond rescue her before she is injured. Susan then orders that Joshua be crucified as a lesson to the others, although Joxer warns her that the heinous punishment will make him a martyr. Susan ignores him and soon after, the slaves watch as Joshua is nailed onto a wooden cross marked like an X, with Charles begging Susan to free the youth. Three days pass as Joshua clings to life, increasing the tension on the plantation.Charles is jailed when he again tries to free Joshua and Susan berates him, telling him that she is the only one who cares for him. Unable to contain his fury, Charles attempts to strangle her through the bars and reveals that Jonathan is his brother. Susan retorts that upon her orders, Raymond cut out Jonathan's tongue and also castrated him as revenge for his infidelities with the slave women. Susan was unaware, however, that Raymond had failed to complete her instructions by killing Jonathan. When Susan threatens to have Charles similarly mutilated, Raymond protests, reminding her that she promised to give him the Englishman when she was through with him. Susan acquiesces, then goes to the fields, where she orders Joxer to whip Joshua. Joxer protests, claiming that the insensible Joshua will not feel the lash, but relents when Susan promises to resume their sexual relationship. Reviving, Joshua recites some Bible verses and dies, and Joxer is forced to whip his corpse to prove that he is dead.After Susan rides away, the slaves, led by Isiah, capture Joxer, while in his rooms, Raymond attempts to seduce Charles. After his efforts prove unsuccessful, Raymond handcuffs Charles to his bed and departs. When Raymond searches the house, he discovers that his men have been hanged from the upper balcony. He is then attacked by the slaves, who hack him to death with their machetes. After Susan finds Raymond's dismembered body in her bathtub, she discovers that Joxer is tied to the front gate, where the slaves are taking turns whipping him. Armed with her own whip, Susan rushes outside but is overwhelmed by the slaves.Meanwhile, Jonathan frees Charles, who pleads with the slaves to stop, assuring them that they have earned their freedom but should end their rampage. Isiah insists that Susan must be punished, although Charles will be spared due to his previous kindnesses. When the slaves are distracted by the appearance of Jonathan, Susan escapes, grabs a shotgun and kills her rampaging husband. The slaves then carry Susan and Charles away, leaving Isiah to kill Joxer with a machete. While Charles is held back, Susan is tied to the same X bearing Joshua's body and is burned alive. After the carnage subsides, freedom sweeps through the islands, and Charles, who has stayed to live with Cleone, witnesses the abolition of slavery and the prosperity of those who work together peacefully."

Kingdom of Naples, 1577: The Roman Inquisition and the witch hunt are in force and torture is authorized in the trials, while the people live in misery and fear. The handsome Spanish nobleman Don Carlos enjoyed it in the convent of Sant'Arcangelo di Baiano, satisfying his eroticism with Sister Giulia di Mondragone, a powerful ecclesiastic who aspired to the title of abbess of the convent. Having evaluated the power of Don Carlos, Giulia tries to please him, while other sisters, especially Sister Carmela, plot against her as interested in the coveted title of abbess. Giulia offers herself on several occasions to Don Carlos, despite being a lesbian and eager to be alone with her sweetheart: Sister Chiara. Giulia pleases Don Carlos even when he asks her to spend a night of love with the beautiful young Sister Isabella, Giulia's niece, forced against her will to take the monastic vows but, in reality, very much in love with a boy from the country 'origin. Considering that the current abbess, Sister Lavina, appears to be ever closer to death, Giulia and Carmela go wild in a war that will have to determine who, on Lavinia's death, will succeed her in her duties and functions. From pure actions moved by jealousy they pass to poisonings, traps, complaints and false accusations. If Sister Giulia favors Don Carlos, Sister Carmela, even through some protectors and lovers, she reveals a criminal conduct at least equal to that of Giulia. The step towards the scandal is short: deaths, threats and beatings accompanied by the sending of anonymous letters to the high ecclesiastical authorities, immediately open a trial. The vicar Carafa, representative of the Inquisition sent by the Archbishop of Naples, deals with the scandal: the ruthless process in which various sisters are tortured and made to confess. To prevent the young Isabelle from seeing her love Mario, she is sent to the convent of St Archangel, where contact with the outside world is strictly forbidden. The old abbess is ill and her end is near. But not near enough as one of the nuns, who wants to become her successor, slowly poisons her.

Tom and Joe are disillusioned New York City cops who decide to pull off one big robbery and retire on the proceeds. Bearer bonds are what the local Mafia boss will buy, so that's what they go for. Central Park is the location for the switch. Can they come out of it with their lives and the money ?—Ian Harries <ih@doc.ic.ac.uk> Joe (Joseph Bolonga), a high-strung, hard-working New York City policeman, finally becomes so frustrated with his demanding and unrewarding job that he robs a liquor store. Afterward, amazed at how simple and satisfying the robbery felt, he confesses to his best friend, police detective Tom (Cliff Gorman).Tom later hosts a party in his suburban backyard, during which a friend who has quit the police force extols the virtues of corporate life and despairs the corruption of the police, prompting Joe to snap defensively that cops like Tom and him are principled, although they could get away with almost anything they desired.Soon after, Joe arrests a woman who stabbed her boyfriend. Upon discovering that she was acting out of fury after catching the man raping her daughter, and knowing the woman will face jail time, Joe is further demoralized.Meanwhile, Tom faces the same disheartenment as he investigates the robbery of a dismissive woman so wealthy that she will barely notice the loss of the stolen goods. One night, Tom suggests that the two abandon their principles and steal something big, worth a million dollars apiece. Over the next few weeks the two discuss possible scenarios, and Tom, the smarter of the pair, concocts a scheme to approach Mafia fence Patsy ONeill (John P. Ryan). Disguised, he visits Patsy in the mobsters home bowling alley and offers to steal anything Patsy wants for $2 million. Patsy, who trusts Tom simply because he is so brash and his idea so straightforward, asks for securities, or treasurers bonds. If Tom can steal $10 million worth, Patsy will pay twenty percent. The mobster offers a phone number and code to get in touch with him, then has Tom ushered out and instructs his men to track and identify him.Although two thugs follow Tom into the subway, Joe, in uniform, blocks off the escalator and Tom escapes. Over the following weeks, Tom researches bonds at the American Stock Exchange, then targets a particular Wall Street securities firm to rob. At the same time, Joe is involved in a street shootout in which his partner, Paul Jones, is shot in the leg. Fearful for his own life, Joe tells Tom he wants only to have enough money to move to Saskatchewan, Canada and buy a farm.Another night, Joe is again shot at and grows more frustrated when he has to protect his new, inexperienced partner. Tom studies the Wall Street firms security system, then announces to Joe that they will carry out the robbery during the upcoming parade welcoming home the astronauts of a recent space trip, at which there will be 150,000 people and hundreds of policemen.On the day of the parade, Tom and Joe, in uniform and wearing fake mustaches, stride into the building and inform the security guard that they must investigate a complaint about items being thrown out the window onto the heads of the parade-goers. Unable to get through the secure doors without an escort, they await senior partner Eastpoole, who reluctantly agrees to bring them in. Having thoroughly investigated the security cameras, Tom has deduced which corridor is out of camera range, and once there, they inform Eastpoole that he is being robbed.The executive coolly instructs his secretary, Ms. Wells, to take Tom to the vault. While a tense Joe watches Tom and Ms. Wellss progress on a monitor in Eastpooles office, the secretary fills Toms satchel with securities. Just then, however, two policemen enter and inform the security guard that a messenger has been shot in the building, necessitating a search of everyone inside. Joe aims a gun at Eastpoole and instructs him to allow the search everywhere but his own office. As Tom travels the hallways, he is forced to hide each time a policeman appears, and as a result his return to Eastpooles office is so slow that Joe, panicked, is about to shoot the executive. Tom finally appears, however, and after handcuffing Ms. Wells and Eastpoole together, quickly resolves to shred the bonds in order to avoid being searched and arrested by the police. Although Joe is at first horrified, Tom explains that they are stealing headlines, not bonds, needing only for ONeill to believe they stole the bonds. Happily, Joe joins Tom in throwing the shreds out the window, where it mingles with the parades confetti.Soon after, Tom hears on the radio that Eastpoole declared they stole $12 million, and realizes that the executive took the other $2 million for himself. Meanwhile, Patsy hears about the robbery and approaches his superior, Mr. Joe, for a loan, explaining that he plans to kill Tom and Joe. Tom is initially afraid to call Patsy, but Joe counsels him that they must go forward, despite the risks.They arrange for the money to be dropped off in Central Park, and upon meeting Patsy's thugs there, count at least ten men. Tom insists on checking out the baskets of money brought by the thugs, and although the first contains false bundles of cash, the second contains the full amount. Returning to the police car manned by Joe, Tom and Joe consult nervously, while outside the park Patsy continues to try, and fail, to confirm Toms and Joes true identities.Meanwhile, the police arrive and block off the park exits. Tom calls the lead thug Marty (Joe Spinell) with the basket of money into the car to make the switch, and as soon as the man sits, Joe drives off. Followed by the thugs, Joe careens through the park, slowed by the roadblocks and a group of irate bicyclists hired by Patsy. At one point, the thug jumps out and Tom and Joe seem trapped, until Joe drives through a barrier into a police parking lot, effectively stymieing everyone in pursuit. By the time the police realize what has happened, Joe and Tom have hopped onto a cross-town bus, where they ride for free after flashing their badges. Later, while Patsy is killed by Mr. Joe, Tom and Joe, having decided to lay low for one year, spend the rest of the summer floating in the pool, dreaming of the day they can break free."

Alma is quite the opposite. She is stern and conservative, more ""establishment."" As their teacher she seems to feel responsible for the girls in what appears to be (Roy considered) a moral and neutralizing factor, underlined, however, (the girls in mind) by another and less prudish intention. This has a disturbing effect on Roy who teases and resents her because of his own ulterior motives. Their attitudes, though humorous at times, establish from the start an undercurrent of hateful antagonism between the two, Roy resorting to sarcasms and insinuations and Alma showing her growing contempt for the handsome and frivolous young man.It is evident that the travelers cannot continue on their way due to the storm so kind, affable Miss Leslie offers them her hospitality... They'll soon find out that Miss Leslie is a dangerous maniac obsessed with the thought of liberating her spirit from her aging body, so that she - the spirit - may take possession of the healthy and wholesome body of a young girl, to make it her own and enjoy with it the pleasures of life and love.With this mania in mind Miss Leslie has caused the death of several girls whom she has embalmed, keeping them in a sort of chapel-like chamber and calling them her ""dolls""... The presence of Alma and the girls is a new incentive for the killer to try again...and again... There are three opportunities and one must succeed.

Then his whole body crumples to the floor in a heap of rotten matter and only the spirit - his spirit - remains standing, stupefied by the transfiguration that has taken place so suddenly... Then the spirit stares at the unconscious girl lying on the floor. He can still take possession of her beautiful body...AND IT HAPPENS...

When Charlie (Daniel Martin) a Native American fur trader, discovers that his young son Mitsah (Missaele) is attempting to befriend a wolf, he scares the beast away, believing it to be too wild and dangerous. Unknown to him, his son persists. Mitsah names the animal White Fang because of the ivory-white teeth the beast sprouts. That night, Charlie changes his mind about the animal when it arrives at his hut barking furiously. Mitsah, while strolling through the woods at night to meet his friend, falls through the ice of a frozen lake and the animal, a wolf/dog cross breed, raises the alarm.Mitsah is saved by his father and canine friend, but falls seriously ill with hypothermia after his plunge into the icy water. Charlie decides to take his son for medical treatment at the nearest settlement. While carrying Mitsah down a mountainside, he meets an old friend named Kurt Johnson (Raimund Harmsdorf) a fellow fur trapper who agrees to help Charlie carry the barely conscious Mitsah. Kurt tells them the nearest town is a place called Dawson City, in which he informs them that it is not safe there. But Charlie tells them that he must get medical attention to his son or he will die. The group, after arriving at a riverside port below the snow line, are introduced to Jason Scott (Franco Nero), a writer traveling to Dawson City in search of a story. Once they arrive in town on a riverboat steamer, they meet with Sister Evangeline (Virna Lisi) a nun who has recently arrived in Dawson City to set up a hospital mission.Jason and Kurt soon discover Dawson City is like an American Wild West frontier town that is a hotbed to business corruption and barely suppressed lawlessness. Sister Evangeline has already encountered corruption in the form of the town's alcoholic priest Father Oatley (Fernando Rey), whose interest in her money is highly suspect. Father Oatley is under the thumb of Dawson City's richest and most powerful resident, Beauty Smith (John Steiner). Smith has bought his way into overall control of the settlement, with some cash and lots of promissory notes he gives to the residents in exchange for gold. He surrounds himself with a posse of thugs wherever he goes and lords it up around town like a dandified 'artisto'. Smith is also romantically involved with Father Oatley's attractive daughter Krista (Carole Andre), who works as a singer and dancer in Dawsons City's notorious bar while her father conceals his paternity connection to her in shame.Sister Evangelina takes care of the sick Mitsah at the hut she plans to turn into a hospital, while outside, Scott, Kurt, and Charlie are threatened by Hall (Rick Battaglia) one of Beauty Smith's henchmen plus a few others, demanding money for keeping Mitsah in town as well as for the hospital sign they put up.

Scott and Kurt arrive on the scene just as Smith's henchmen disperse where the assembled townspeople, gripped with fear of retribution, claim to have seen nothing.White Fang is captured by Smith's henchmen and put to service, earning money in a public fight against a captured, wild bear chained to a post. White Fang is severely injured before Scott and Sister Evangelina arrive to rescue him.

In the meantime, Scott takes a parental interest to the youngster.Soon, everything starts to go wrong for Beauty Smith as karma catches up to him. Smith tries to persuade Krista to accompany him away from Dawson City for he is planning to skip town with his ill-gotten money, trailing unpaid promissory notes behind him. A frantic tussle erupts where Smith accidentally shoots Krista, killing her. Father Oatley, arrives on the scene and sees what Smith has done. Enraged, Oatley runs out onto the streets shouting Smith's secret to the startled townsfolk. Smith immediately decides to start packing to move onto Nome, Alaska where more gold has recently been discovered and set up shop there.

She identifies the man behind the traffic accident.Once it is known that Mala has broken her word, Teja's men come after her. She is chased through the night, narrowly escaping across the train tracks, and coming to Inspector Khanna's house, desperate for shelter.

Khanna kindly takes her to his brother and sister-in-law, and, under the sister-in-law's tutelage, Mala begins to learn how to keep house, as well as English, and other refinements.Eventually, Vijay is framed for bribery, stripped of his title and position as inspector, and jailed for 6 months on false charges, trapped by Teja. When he is released from jail, he plans to take revenge. Mala, by this time, has developed from a frightened stranger seeking his help to a romantic interest for him. She begs him, to seal their relationship, that he must stop being so vengeful. He agrees, but soon must come to terms with such a promise when he meets, in a Christian cemetery, the informant who had called him in the past when he was an inspector. The man, De Silva (Om Prakash), appears half-insane, holding onto an empty bottle. He says that on Christmas several years before, his three sons drank poisoned moonshine, and died from it. Until the killer is found, he will continue to wander with the bottle. When local criminals mocked him and called him crazy, he vowed to get back at them as he could: by phoning the inspector when a crime was about to happen.After hearing this news, Vijay becomes depressed, torn between his desire to help the grieving De Silva, and his need to keep his promise to Mala that he would not take any more revenge on the lowlifes of the town. Eventually, along with a concerted effort by Sher Khan to cheer up Vijay, Mala relents, vowing she will not try to control him, and says he must do what is right.The trail of tainted moonshine leads back to Teja and his men. Upon finally cornering the crook on Diwali, fireworks bursting overhead, Vijay also finds out that the person who murdered his parents, 20 years before, on the same night, is Teja, recognizable by the Zanjeer on his wrist. Sher Khan helps him to fight Teja and his men, and take justice into their own hands, until the police arrive. When the hapless police inspector is held at gunpoint by Teja, Vijay manages to drop to retrieve a pistol from the ground, and shoots him dead, his body falling into the swimming pool."

When her sadistic mobster boyfriend Travers (Joe De Santis) burns her with his cigar, brazen blonde Cleo (Angel Tompkins) retaliates by burning his private parts, sending him to the shower for relief. Once Travers returns to the bedroom, Cleo robs him at gunpoint and goes to the apartment of her friend Buzz (Todd Susman), where, after removing her clothes from his closet, she gives Buzz Travers' watch as a gift and flees. Soon after, Travers' henchmen, Faust (Jon Cedar) and Ganz (Philip Kenneally), come looking for her and when Buzz refuses to tell them where she is, they beat him up.Now disguised in a brown wig, Cleo drives into a small town and pawns her fur coat for cash. Unbuttoning her sweater, Cleo convinces the owner of the local café to hire her as a waitress. Soon after, two midgets, named Cadillac (Jerry Maren) and Monty (Frank Delfino), come to the café where Cleo is working. As they explain that they are in show business and invite her to see their act, a customer begins to harass Cleo and they beat him up.That night at an outdoor stage, Cleo watches ""Slick Bender and His Little Cigars,"" an act featuring five midgets performing feeble acrobatics and corny routines. Cleo witnesses the performers making money, not only by passing the hat during the show, but by robbing parked cars, including hers. The following night, as they are dismantling the stage, she arrives demanding they return her gun, which was in her car. The gregarious Monty and Cadillac respond by offering her a drink and introducing her to fellow ""cigars"" Frankie (Felix Silla) and Hugo (Emory Souza). When their tough boss Slick Bender (Billy Curtis) rushes over to get rid of her, Cleo threatens to report the theft, but Slick retorts that the police should also check to see if the gun is stolen. Her bluff called, Cleo walks away.Later, Slick goes to the café to see Cleo, returning her gun and offering her a job in his show, which she rudely refuses. Soon after, Travers' thugs arrive and she escapes by throwing coffee on Faust and shooting Ganz.Performing in a new town, the Little Cigars are now selling a vitamin-enriched candy bar, purported to work as a love potion. As proof of its effectiveness, Slick introduces scantily clad Cleo as his girl friend while the four other little men mingle with the crowd, selling candy bars and picking pockets. Later, when Slick accuses Cleo of teasing the midgets, she angrily leaves to find ""a big man"" and is kissing a stranger in a bar when Slick barges in. A fight ensues, with Cleo taking Slick's side and ultimately holding the bar patrons at gunpoint as he cleans out the register, after which they leave together.After she and Slick have made love, Cleo convinces him that the gang could make more money by using their size as an advantage. Slick then approaches the gang about doing bigger jobs, assuring them that the proceeds will be divided evenly, and they soon embark on a string of robberies. In one, Cleo leaves her car at a garage and when the mechanic closes up, the gang jumps out of the trunk and robs him. Next, they hold up the cashier of a movie theater, escaping under the turnstile. Finally, entering a commercial laundry by hiding inside bags of dirty linen, they force the owner to open the safe and, after stealing the money, escape into a waiting truck. Each time, Cleo drives them away to safety.
At the next town, they go to a strip club where the dancers and midgets are old friends. Later, after Frankie is admitted to a backroom dice game, he ushers the gang in and they rob the gamblers.Back in their isolated hideout, Slick divides the money and is about to discuss the big job, when Cadillac announces that he and Monty want to quit, having decided that five midgets and a blonde will be conspicuous, and soon be caught. Furious, Slick tells Hugo and Frankie to leave, too. Late that night, Faust and Ganz, who have followed Cleo there, enter the house, dragging her out of bed and waking the household. When they threaten to kill her, Slick shoots Ganz dead and Hugo strangles Faust, after which Slick observes that they must now stick together.For their next job, the midgets are delivered to a grocery store hiding in crates of broccoli. As they sneak out of the crates that night to rig the safe with explosives, the police see Slick and Cleo parked in the lot. Cleo claims that they are cheating on their spouses and charms them into believing her until the gang shatters the glass door. The police grab Cleo, but the others get away.The next day, Cleo is being transported by the police when a boy on a bicycle falls in front of their car. When the officers run to the child they realize it is really Monty, who has tricked them into thinking he was a child, and he pulls a gun on them. Cleo escapes to a waiting van, where she thanks Slick for rescuing her and he replies that he needs her for the big job, but finally admits he has feelings for her.The gang arrives in Los Angeles where Cleo cases the Hollywood employment office. Back at their hotel, they finalize their plans for the job and talk about what they will do when they are rich, Cleo saying that she and Slick will go to San Francisco.In the morning, they charge into the employment office with guns drawn, and after forming a pyramid, the top man climbs into the cashier's cage, demanding the money. Slick escapes to Cleo's waiting car, but when the police start shooting she drives away, leaving the others behind, and in the ensuing gun battle, Frankie is shot.In San Francisco, Cleo arrives at a luxury hotel with Slick hidden in her trunk. Once in their room, Slick hides the money in a ceiling vent. Cleo is indifferent when Slick expresses sadness over Frankie and, when he later suspects her of sneaking out, he bitterly observes that she has a bad habit of leaving midgets behind. She then comforts him over the fate of the gang members and invites him into her bed.The next morning, Slick wakes up to find a note saying she has gone to get their passports. While he is shaving, the rest of the gang, having eluded the police, pick the lock and enter. Incredulous when Slick appears happy to see them, the gang demands the money and when Slick discovers it is missing, they think he is deceiving them. They beat him and begin to strangle him, until they realize that he is heartbroken by Cleo's desertion and betrayal. Just then, Cleo comes back and Cadillac demands the money. Holding a gun to Slick's head, Cadillac gives her five seconds to produce the cash. Once she turns it over, they threaten to rape her, but decide against it, implying that they have all slept with her before. After they have left with the money, Cleo convinces Slick she was faithful and when confronted about leaving him behind, reminds him that she ultimately returned.In the final scene, on deserted carnival grounds, Slick pitches the love potion candy bars from the back of the truck while a bikini-clad Cleo moves among the small crowd to sell them."

DISTANT THUNDER. Written and directed by Satyajit Ray. India, 1972. Music: Ray. Leading players: Soumitra Chatterji, Babita.If you crossed an Italian neorealist film with a work by Japanese director Yasujiro Ozu, the result might be something like Distant Thunder. In a unique way, Indian director Satyajit Ray combines a social consciousness in a changing society with a slow narrative style to reveal nuances of character. The relaxed pace allows us to enter the world and experience the internal process and transformation of an individual. Rays films often play on the tension between traditional customs and the effects of urban modernization with a naturalness that has you wondering if his characters are real people or actors.There are few directors who give you the sense of knowing the characters as Ray does. Soumitra Chatterji as the Brahmin in Distant Thunder is gradually revealed on several levels through his relationship with his wife, students, patients and townspeople. It is the visibility of his internal dialogue and the reassessment of his values and social position amidst the so-called manmade famine of 1943 that structure the movement of the film.As the Brahmin's authority and stature in the community are rendered inconsequential by a hunger which levels all class distinctions, he is forced to give up the superiority which separates him from the peasants. With deliberate and dissecting camera movement, Ray establishes a set of polarities from the opening shots which mark the progression of Chatterji's character. His wife Babita is introduced via a hand rising above the swirling waters of a river. The course of the film literally flows in and around water, and the beginning of the famine is signaled by the cholera epidemic which prevents use of river water for drinking.Similarly, the turning point in the pundits life occurs at the waters edge. Crushed by his impotence after watching a riot at the rice mill he retreats to the shore to reconsider his position. He has been undergoing a gradual disillusionment, and comments to his wife that he doesnt understand the inability of money to buy what they need. It is Babita who proves to be more resourceful, and her embodiment of the creative force is indicated by her closeness to water. After an attempted rape she throws herself into the cleansing river. She is the one who must ultimately become the provider for the family and the link to the community.Opposed to the creative spirit expressed through the water imagery is a progression of fire symbols, signs of a burnt-out existence. The first indication of an interruption of natural forces comes in the opening moments as the townswomen, bathing, watch the flying ships overhead, harbingers of war and famine. Ray uses several closeups of insects and butterflies feeding on parched ground, but the most obvious use of fire is the badly burned body of the kiln worker. In this distorted social order he ironically becomes the supplier of grain. He is constantly seen lighting cigarettes, and smoking is a kind of social ritual throughout the film. Notice the discarded cigarette tossed in the stream as well as other instances of burning and clouding-over of life-giving water.Just as Babita's contact with the natural forces signifies a sympathy and understanding of the other sufferers, the grotesque halfburned, half-normal face of the kiln worker exaggerates his isolation and separateness from the rest of society. He has too much face. To comprehend his place in the life of the community and move closer to its creative center, the Brahmin must humble himself and undergo a loss of face. We see his metamorphosis as Ray builds silhouettes against a vast sky. The first silhouette is that of the old beggar man who asks the Brahmin for food. Later, as he realizes his false dependence on the peasants, the Brahmin undergoes his loss of face and he too appears in silhouette. Throughout the film we find small forms outlined against a large background until the final climactic and powerful image of a community joined together against a disaster manufactured by an individual act somewhere in the distance.James GreenbergSubmitted by James Spee on July 18, 2007. I first saw this film at the Seattle Film Society showing 30 years ago and I still remember it vividly."

Merry-Go-Round,1973,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0072075/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Adaptation of Arthur Schnitzler's famous play ""Reigen"", previously filmed as ""La Ronde"" by Max Ophüls in 1950 and Roger Vadim in 1964. 1. Late evening. Leocadia (Gertraud Jesserer), a young prostitute, picks up Franz (Hans Brenner), a soldier on his way back to barracks. Though she offers him sex for free, he doesn't have time to go home with her, so they have sex on the embankment of the river Danube. He won't give her his name and laughs off her request for a tip. She yells abuse as he heads off.2. Franz has led Maria (Sydne Rome), a housemaid on her day off, out of a dance hall on a Sunday evening. They have just met, but soon go and have sex in the park. Afterwards, he quickly loses interest in her and wants to get back to the dance. His reluctant promise to walk her home is soon forgotten as he finds a new partner.3. A hot summer afternoon. Alfred (Helmut Berger), the grown-up son of the household, is home alone with the flirtatious Maria. He is expecting a caller, but seduces Maria. Just as they are having sex on the salon table, the doorbell rings; but there is no-one there by the time she gets to the door. She begs him to stay, but he leaves for the café. She helps herself to a cigar.4. Alfred has borrowed an apartment for an assignation with Emma (Senta Berger), a young married woman. She arrives veiled and nervous, determined not to stay; but after some brandy and candied fruit, allows herself to be seduced. He suffers a bout of impotence and makes grandiose excuses. She teases and pets him; a second go at sex is more successful. Horrified at how late it has become and the lies she is going to have to tell when she gets home, Emma declares that she will never see Alfred again; but they realise that they will be at the same party the following evening.5. Late evening. Emma is reading in bed. Her somewhat older husband Charles (Peter Weck) comes in; one of the periodic Platonic phases of their marriage is about to end. These periods of sexual abstinence, he explains, mean that they can keep having 'honeymoons'. She asks him about the women he slept with before they were married and wonders if married women ever prostitute themselves; he chides her for her curiosity. They make love, recalling the first night of their honeymoon in Venice five years before.6. The Girl (Maria Schneider) has allowed Charles to pick her up in the street and to treat her to dinner in the private room of a restaurant. She is nineteen, at once flirtatious and innocent; he questions her closely, trying to work out just how promiscuous she is. Tipsy with wine and claiming that he reminds her of a former sweetheart, she has sex with him. Afterwards, they fall out; she disbelieves his claims that he is single and from out of town. But they make up, and she agrees to become his mistress.7. The Girl has been for a walk with Robert (Michael Heltau); they return to his apartment. Though it is getting dark, he refuses to light the lamps. He claims that he loves her and asks if she loves him in return. His talk is all literary and self-obsessed; first he says that he is 'Biebitz', a famous playwright, then he insists that he is only a shop assistant. They have sex on the divan. He then says that he knows Biebitz and promises to send her a ticket to his play.8. Robert (who really is Biebitz) and The Actress (Erika Pluhar), who is starring in his latest play, have gone off to a country inn together. Every inch the diva, she teases him mercilessly, claiming still to be devoted to an ex by the name of Fritz. Eventually she invites him to join her in bed, and they have sex. Afterwards, though continuing to wrong-foot him at every turn, she tells him that he is a genius and that she has been sick with love for him.9. The Count (Helmut Lohner), a cavalry officer, is paying a visit to The Actress. Though it is midday, she is still in bed. She is flattered by his compliments on her performance on stage the night before and flirts with him. Though exasperated by his formal manner, she is fascinated by his 'live-for-the-moment' philosophy of life and his aristocratic fastidiousness. When she offers herself to him, he at first declines, saying that he dislikes having sex in the mornings. But he can't resist her for long. Afterwards, they arrange to meet again when she returns from the theatre that evening.10. Early morning. The Count is in Leocadia's room. She is asleep in the bed; he has woken up, still dressed, on the couch, nursing a hangover and trying to remember how he got there. He is about to leave, when she wakes. He is struck by her beauty and asks her about her life. She reminds him of someone from his past and he kisses her eyes, thinking that has been their only intimacy; but the fantasy is shattered when she tells him that they had drunken sex the night before. He walks out into the deserted street as day dawns over Vienna."

The young lady tries to cope with the aftermath of this dramatic event but her life is ruined. Young and pretty factory workers are happy when - at the end of the day - the bell rings marking the time they may go home. The dark streets are menacing to a young girl alone, and one of them is harassed by two men and she has to dun to her place, and then run upstairs, as there's an electric fault and the lift doesn't work. But two other men, a bald-head and a fatso, are blocking her way - they are now a gang of four. Between the five of them, they drag her up the last flight of stairs to the rooftop, and strip her. She loses her lunchbox, and her virginity to the hoodlums: the fatso, the bald-head, the one with a necklace with a pendant, the one with a little mustache, and the laughing one.Chu Ling wakes up from her faint in time to watch from the window the five men roaring away in their motorbikes. She staggers to the landlady's room, and she starts arguing with her about the unpaid rent, telling Ling, ""Night shift... Bullshit."" The landlady's husband adds that she would better raise money by working at a nightclub. Unaided, Ling returns home to clean herself from her facial wounds and the vagina bleeding. Back to the factory, she picks up a knife - and in a rage, starts destroying the cloth she was working on.Released from work by the Factory Foreman, she is taken with pain in her sex, and goes to the WC of a commercial center to examine herself, and is horrified by what she sees. She doesn't go to a nearby hospital, because she is obsessed by the sound of bikers on the streets, and can't stand them without crying. Late that evening, she goes to the nightclubs' area, aiming to see again her rapists.She sees a bald man going into a bar, and goes in after him. She addresses him, but when she sees his face, she understands this is aging man, and asks his pardon. Instead, he grabs her, wanting her to join the girl he was with already. The Nightclub Manager intervenes, taking the girl out of the harassing patron's hands.Instead of going away, Ling asks the manager to work there. Wong eyes her up and down, and confers with his beautiful partner Hung at the office. She checks on the applicant's breasts, and find them OK, so she tells the manager to go on. He wants to know how old Ling is - 21 - and if her family knows about this. Ling says she has no family, and refuses to tell her reason to work there. Hung accepts Ling as her roommate, and leads her in her first night work next day.Ling is picked-up by two young men at once, and they start fondling her sex first thing, which she can't stand. She wants to run, but they grab her - and again she is saved by the Manager. The two men mock him, because he has a limp and a walking cane, and he proceeds to beat them.
Order is restored, and Hung comments she has worked in the place for three years, and never seen the Manager fight to defend a girl before.
Both Ling and Wong lower their eyes, with coy smiles.When the night comes to a close, the Barman is satisfied, counting the money in front of the staff: HK$ 2,356. Not enough, he says. The girls around him forward more money from their own pockets. Ling wants to know what the money is for. Hung tells her that it's for the funeral of one of them who's died of Vietnam Rose. Ling is unaware of it, and asks about it. One Bar Girl tells it's a form of syphilis brought by infected American soldiers from Vietnam, and describes the symptoms. Ling is worried enough, and then Hung tells the infected girls will die. Ling gives her all her money to the dead girl, HK$200, and runs away. Later, at Hung's place, she tries to hide the pain she is feeling from her, but Hung wont be fooled. She decides to take the girl to an unregistered Doctor who may help her.Doctor Huang closes the office's door from inside, and the heavy curtains, and tells Ling to undress completely. After checking her breathing, and breasts, he inspects her sex on the gynecological table. He tells her that she has the Vietnam Rose, and that's incurable - and yet he promises to treat her if she accepts being nice to him. She goes mad at the doctor, and stabs him with a pair of scissors, just ripping his white frock, and runs away without paying.Ling's attackers are now conducting an armed robbery at a jewelry shop. The Guard rings the alarm, and they shoot him dead, escaping with a lot of jewels, driving at speed through town. The leader instructs Atom, the bald-head driver, where to leave their car, and tells the others that the jewels will not be sold until much later.Ling asks Wong to teach her the killing kung fu, and confesses she needs it to take revenge on the men who have infected her with Vietnam Rose. He is reluctant to, but finally agrees. The painful lessons take place after hours, at the nightclub, with the Barman as a spectator.
Their intimacy progresses to the point of they becoming lovers - after another kung fu lesson at his place.Chung, Ling's attacker whose necklace with a pendant she had memorized during the attack, decides to spend some time with a girl at Ling's working place. Ling recognizes him by the pendant... Chung refuses to pay for Ling's ""night out"" and punches the Barman. The Manager is about to stop him, when Ling intervenes, and takes Chung out - after having hidden the Doctor's scissors in her knee boots. Chung goes to an underground car parking, and is about to rob a car, when he discovers neither he nor Ling have money to pay for the hotel room. So, he attempts to rob a well dressed man in the restroom, finds he only has cards and papers with him, and finally leaves with only the meager coins of the Restroom Attendant.Since he has no money, he stops the car in a desert place. She tells him, ""I love you to death."" Outside the car, she uses kung fu on him, he pulls a knife, she pulls her scissors, and manages to stab him to the crotch - killing him. Next, she's drunk at the nightclub.The news of the murder are already in the newspaper's front-page. She tells the Manager that she's sad that she killed the man before he could give him any clues about the other attackers. But the Manager says he knows who one of them is, the Pimp.The Pimp is taking two schoolgirls to a nightclub where there's go-go dancing, and drugs to spice the innocent girls' drinks. Drugged they're abused, stripped, and taken photos and filmed with an 8 mm camera to make further extortion demands from them. Then he tells they are to be taken to Mr. Wong, to be prostitutes, and walks back to the bar to have a drink - just as Ling arrives, asking for him. She remembers his continuous smile, the same as when he was raping her. She invites him to dance, and mid dance she tells him ""I am the lady on the rooftop."" His smile drops, but then comes back again to his face. They keep dancing, and at the top of the loud music and crowd's shouting, she stabs him repeatedly to the chest and belly. As most of the dancers fall to the floor exhausted, the Pimp falls to the floor, dying. She leaves the place in a hurry, and is seen by a friend of the Pimp who was in the street. This man goes up to the nightclub, and hears the Pimp's last words, ""The lady on the rooftop.""The Pimp goes straight to an underground casino, to tell his partners in the attack what happened. He had seen her face, that looked familiar, and then the Pimp's last words. The Crocodile had told Atom that he was going to the Springtime Bar, the night he was killed, so the bald-head - who still has the marks of Ling's fingernails on his bald head - and they decide to kill her, leaving the did to Heroine, the man with the little mustache. Heroine follows Ling through the dark streets, again. He pulls a razor blade, and she runs. She manages to hide for a moment behind a parked Volkswagen, and when she sees two policemen doing their beat, she shows herself - and feigns to faint in the middle of the street. The cops decide to escort her home, and she manages to wave a goodbye kiss in the direction of the Pimp - who's now hiding behind the same car.As the cops go away, the Pimp tries to locate Ling again, but fails. Hung is there, but with no avail for Ling's pains, who are getting worse.
Hung puts on Ling's fur coat, and goes out to search for medicine. The Pimp mistakes Hung for Ling, and stabs her a couple of times. She manages to frighten him away by shouting and throwing her playing cards at him - their cutting edges hurting his face a bit. The Pimp runs away, but Ling goes after him, and they face up again at a cemetery. He tries to hit her with a spike-ax, she kicks him to the crotch, disarms him, and kills him with the spike-ax to the groin.Back at home, Hung tells Ling about that man, Heroine, one who had disgraced her years before with his two friends, Wong and Atom, at a casino. She gives the address of the Yan Chai Casino to Ling. Hung is too hurt to accompany Ling in her quest, but she offers her her playing cards, that have thin blades hidden under the usual art surfaces, so that she may face multiple enemies at the casino. Hung teaches Ling how to throw several cards at once, and they stuck deep in a wall. Ling proves to be a fast learner.The Casino Boss decides to play poker against Ling, but she beats him. When he raises the next bet to HK$50,000 it's time for her to raise the stakes - he demands her body for the night if she loses, and she demands he hands her Wong and Atom if he loses. ""Why?"" he asks. ""We've debts to settle,"" she answers. He accepts, and for a moment he thinks he has won. But she has a straight flush that beats him again. She sets the encounter for 3 a.m. the next day, and tells him to identify her just as ""the lady on the rooftop, they'll understand"".Ling returns to the Springtime Bar, to present her resignation as a bar girl, and spend some romantic time with the Manager. He promises to take her away to somewhere else, after shes kills the two two men next morning. The two thugs make a phone call to Hung's apartment, harassing her, and then cut the phone wires, preventing her to call the police. She has barricaded herself, and is armed with a knife. Atom escalates the outside wall and breaks in through a bay-window, while Wong, who has a spiked knuckleduster, breaks the front door in.
They attack her, rip her nightgown away, and beat her to death despite her fighting back.Atom and Wong report to the Casino Boss, and then go out to hire more thugs to defend them. As 3 a.m. are about to strike, the Casino Assistant #2 closes the place, sending the last players out. Ling mounts the stairs to the casino, afflicted with pain from her crotch, and finds the place deserted and with no lights. Then the lights go up, and Ling finds herself surrounded by Atom, Wang, the Casino Boss, and four thugs. There's a long fight in which she takes a number of blows, and her clothes are ripped. She surprises them by starting to do a trick with the pack of cards, and then wounds the men with her recently learned throwing ability.Ling is down again when the door opens, and Wong comes in with his walking cane to give her a hand. Wong engages the thugs in a long fight with weapons, his cane at a point turning up to be a sword-cane. Wang and Atom run away, and Ling - who's just recomposed herself - goes after them, leaving her boyfriend Wong to battle the rest of the gang.She catches up with the fugitives in a corridor, and hunts them down an outside spiral staircase to the street. The fight proceeds until she stabs Atom to the neck with a pair of scissors, but he stabs back at her crotch with the jagged end of a broken beer bottle. She then stabs him to the crotch with Atom's knife, but Wang stabs her back repeatedly with the knuckle-duster. She stabs back at his crotch with the scissors, and the three fall to the ground grabbing their crotches, and oozing blood.Despite his infirmity, Wong jumps from a first floor to catch Thugs #1 and 2 who were trying to escape his fury, and again they fight, now on the street. He strikes both to the belly with his sword-cane, and they fell apparently dead.The police is arriving at the spot, and Wong lifts up the badly wounded Ling."

Upon being released from prison, Bobby Lee Dixon returns to his hometown in Georgia and requests that his former boss, J. J. ""Jumpy"" Belk, rehire him as a mechanic. Jumpy agrees, then buys Bobby Lee a beer. When Bobby Lee throws the empty cup at an off-duty police officer, J. W. Workman, the boy gets punched. Later, Bobby Lee visits Arneda Johnson, an African American madame, who helped raise him. She offers Bobby Lee a job smuggling cigarettes, but he declines, explaining that he promised his girl friend, Ruthie Chalmers, who is also Jumpy's daughter, that he would stay out of trouble. That night, Bobby Lee and Ruthie argue. She refuses to divorce her husband because she and Bobby Lee do not make enough money to live on. The next day, while picking up a shipment of sparkplugs in Savannah, Florida, Bobby Lee sees a bank and decides to rob it. After acquiring a pistol and borrowing Jumpy's truck, Bobby Lee convinces a reluctant Ruthie to help him with the heist. Upon arrival, they notice Officers Suggs, a police deputy, sitting across the street, but go into the bank anyway. During the robbery, Angus Wages, the bank's president, informs them that they should have come on a payday, as the bank only has a few thousand dollars in the tills. Suggs is scheduled to enter the bank any minute, so Ruthie pleads for Bobby Lee to hurry. He empties only a few drawers before they run outside and drive away. Suggs sees the speeding pickup truck and a car chase ensues, ending at an old farmhouse. Bobby Lee and Ruthie hide in the woods, and when Suggs enters the house, they flee in his police cruiser. Later, Jumpy berates Bobby Lee for robbing a bank, and then gives him and Ruthie a car so they can escape to Mexico.

Peggy attempts to rape Ruthie, but Stacy helps fight her off. Upstairs, Workman and another jailer beat Bobby Lee until Arneda arrives with two of her ""girls,"" pretending to look for a friend. Workman orders the jailer to lockup Bobby Lee before helping Arneda. One of the prostitutes offers to keep Workman ""company,"" but he refuses, telling her he has something special in the women's block. Workman then brings Ruthie to his office. Meanwhile, Arneda follows the jailer to the cells, hits him with a blackjack, and frees Bobby Lee. Not finding Ruthie in her cell, they free Stacy, break into Workman's office, and discover him raping Ruthie. Bobby Lee grabs Workman's gun and pistol-whips him until Arneda pulls him away.

Heera Panna was Dev Saab's third film as a director. It was a reasonably good film which did above average business.The doe eyed Raakhee portrayed grace and elegance,while the bikini clad Zeenat was all about physical charm, and a sheer delight for the camera.
Mainly, the movie is a road caper filmed on Bengaluru- Chennai Highway with flashbacks of some exotic locales of Hongkong. Heera ( Dev Anand) is an international photographer who has an affair with an air hostess Reema (Raakhee) in Hongkong who unfortunately dies in a plane crash.Heera comes to India to attend a party thrown by a Maharaja of an estate near Bengaluru.In the party, Paintal and Zeenat steal the royal diamond of Maharani and hide it in Heera's car. As the story unfolds, we know that Zeenat was emotionally blackmailed by Dheeraj into participating in the diamond heist. Dheeraj works for Jeevan but wants the diamond all by himself with the help of Manmohan and Maruti. Sudhir and Shyam Kumar are Jeevan's partners but they also get greedy and attempt to get hold of the diamond for themselves. Since Jeevan boss is too smart to trust Dheeraj, Shyam Kumar, or Sudhir; he sends a separate team of his men disguised as policemen, and finally joins the ranks himself.
The hero comes to know that Panna ( Zeenat) is Rakhee's sister and convinces her to leave the villain ( Dheeraj) and restore the diamond to its rightful owner. Meanwhile, all the goons land there to take possession of the diamond and there is a Western style gun fight in which the hero proves that he is not only an ace cameraman , he is also a sharp shooter who is a faster draw than the best of the cowboys. The rocky terrain that adjoins the Bengaluru- Chennai Highway makes it the perfect setting for a Western.
Dev, Zeenat, and Raakhee look great; and Rehman shines in a cameo. AK Hangal,Manmohan, Sudhir, Shyam Kumar, and Paintal have nothing much to do. Dilip Dutt ( Do you remember Mani of Guide) looks pathetic as Jeevan's henchman disguised as a policeman.
RD Burman's music is very good particularly the songs- Panna Ki tamanna, and Bahut Door Mujhe Chale Jaana Hai. When I first saw the movie, there was another lovely song- Ek Paheli Hai Tu, Nar Naveli Hai tu- which is not there in the you tube version.
The movie would have done more business if Panna (Zeenat) was not killed in the end.The viewers expected Dev to unite with Zeenat particularly as he had lost his earlier girlfriend Reema (Raakhee) to a plane crash. What was the point in killing both the heroines?"

Loops,1973,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0824685/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"In the Summer of 1972 I agreed to direct and act in several porno loops. I contacted William Markle, a local New York Cinematographer, and asked him if he had an interest in creating a documentary, in partnership with me, about a day in the life of a pornographer. He jumped at the chance. In 1972 porno was all the rage, and we thought that a documentary, or docudrama about the making of XXX rated films might just be successful at the box office. The actors who participated in the shooting of the loops were: Myself, Harry Reems, Fred Lincoln, Lucy Grantham, Sargeant Tina, and several Gypsies. The footage turned out to be hilarious, but it needed another element in order to hold an audience's interest for feature length. I wrote a story about a film maker, who was making porno on the side, unbeknownst to Mrs. Film maker. We Hired an actress/belly dancer named Cathy Joyce to play my wife, and shot the script I had written. We intercut the new dramatized scenes of the film maker and his wife with the original documentary footage of the making of porno loops, and the result was a feature length docudrama, or docucomedy called ""LOOPS"". In the Fall of 1972 Bill Markle and I began the process of screening our project for potential distributors. Everybody saw it; MGM, Avco Embassy, Columbia, Paramount, Warners. Heady times for a couple of young film makers. In the end none of the majors had the guts to pull the trigger on this kind of project. We came close with Warners, but they finally decided against it. During one of the screenings, Sean Cunningham (Last House On the Left, Friday the Thirteenth)began weeping. He saw ""LOOPS"" as the story of his life, right down to having the same first name as the main character. (Me) So Bill and I sold the picture to Cunningham. The sale figure didn't exactly break the bank, but it was way more than it cost to make so Bill and I were Happy. After some re-shooting and re-editing, Cunningham opened ""LOOPS"" to mixed reviews and pretty negative box office. This movie seems to have completely disappeared from the face of the earth. In the mid Seventies ""LOOPS"" was in the archives of the Lincoln Center Film Society, but since then has fallen through the cracks. Cunningham may, or may not still own the rights to this picture, but to my knowledge, no attempt has been made to release ""LOOPS"" in video or dvd.—Shaun Costello"

Zenka onna: Koroshi-bushi,1973,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0451984/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"After her father is exploited and killed by a yakuza gang, a tough woman, fresh out of prison, exacts her revenge over said gang with the help of three girls she met in prison. Reiko Ike stars as the daughter of a man who has been pushed into drug dealing by the local Yakuza mob. Having outlived his usefulness to the gang he is murdered and Reiko is gang raped, leading her to attempt a knife attack on the Yakuza boss (Ryoji Hayama) at a swank nightclub. Failing to kill him she ends up in prison, where she befriends a crew of other malcontents (including Yumiko Katayama and Chiyoko Kazama) and meets the Yakuza boss's girlfriend (Miki Sugimoto). Upon release Reiko reassembles her mob and launches a Machiavellian scheme to engineer a gang war between Hayama's Oba Industries and the formerly dominant Hamayasu Clan. The rival gangs begin killing each other off and Reiko works her way closer to her ultimate vengeance.—rabbit541 Maki Hashida (Reiko Ike) attempts to slay Maki Hashida (Reiko Ike) when he goes to a topless go-go bar, but his henchmen protect him well, she wounds a few but is overcome by them. (Credits start rolling.)Maki is sent to prison, and in the same bus goes a beautiful and happy first-time offender, Natsuko Kimura (Chiyoko Kazama), condemned to 26 months for robbing a motorcycle and injuring a cop in a motorcycle chase (flashback). Two other girls tell their stories (all in flashback): Yukie Nakagawa (Masami Sôda), the pickpocket, tells hers at the sewing mill; Kaoru Ashida (Yumiko Katayama), tells in the recreation yard how she got three years in prison for rape, extortion, and assault... of a john who didn't pay after he had sex with her.Everything serves the young women to make merry, but not so Masayo Tani (Miki Sugimoto), a gangster's moll, who keeps to herself, apart from the others in the recreation yard. (A flashback shows how she was attacked by men at a gambling parlor, when they deemed she had cheated; they stripped her, exposing the large tattoo of a dragon covering her back and buttocks.) Masayo's eyes cross the the opposite end of the yard, and she stares at the other lonely inmate, Maki. In the evening, when the girls play dice in a communal cell, Maki's silence gets on the others' nerves. Masayo interferes, and tries to impose her leadership, but Maki won't answer even her - who deems this an untenable lack of respect.In the morning, a duel is arranged in the recreation yard. Inmates not being provided with knives, the two young women face up with long shards of glass in their right hands, and a three yard tether made up of pieces of cloth knotted together, held between their teeth. The piece of rope allowed some distance between them, but not much. The first to scream after a cut, loses the fight. Mika and Masayo are encircled by the prison populace who watch with glee as the two slashed at each other, in silence. Maki is wounded twice, both girls cut each others' arms, but keep holding their grips on the cloth tether with their left hands. Maki breaks her improvised blade. Next, she is cut across the chest, ripping open her prison tunic, and then she loses the small shard she still had, and is cut across the left cheek. Yet, neither cried, nor flinched. Masayo drops her weapon, and lifts up her fists, in a mute invitation to change the weapons. There is a break forced by the guards passing with a group of other detainees, during which the fighters are shielded from the guards by a line of their comrades.The fighting pair punch and knee each other for a while, then grapple and roll on the ground, until they trample - twice - over a box of white powder [possibly quicklime] that subsequently spreads on the ground, and the girls' bodies, impairing their sight. Yet, they grapple and punch each other in a frenzy. Maki, her eyes closed, keeps punching off target, and falling, and tripping, and falling, and Masayo limits herself to throw Maki down again. A couple of girls tell Maki that she lost, and try to grab her, but she waves her arms around to shove them away, and using the tether for guidance, stubbornly gets back at Masayo. Maki's clothes have been torn so that both her breasts are exposed, and now she clinches with Masayo, and slaps her a couple of times. Maki is so tired that she falls onto her back without moving, and Masayo stops fighting, and looks down at Maki in awe. When, against all odds, Maki stands up after a minute of swoon, her teeth still gripped on her end of the cloth, coming at Masayo for another blind clinch, Masayo lets fall her point of the tether, and says, «You won.» Masayo walks away, Maki delivers two punches in the air, and collapses again, totally spent.Maki won the respect of every inmate for not giving up, and soon after, she tells them (in flashbacks) what was behind her silence. Maki saw her father's body being recovered from a river by the police, knowing that he had been forced by the yakuza into dealing in drugs; he became a drunkard, and a useless father, but he was her only family; and then she was raped by that gang, too. The other girls reproach her for having tried to avenge her father alone, and wonder why she didn't tell the full story to the police. Maki keeps silent again.
Masayo asks, ""Which yakuza group killed your father?""
""Oba Industries.""
""Oba?""
""What? Do you know them?""
""No..."" Yet, Masayo's expression betrays her, and Maki was staring at her.A few years later, Maki leaves prison, and her three best friends - Kaoru, Natsuko, and Yukie - are waiting for her. Maki gives them the cold shoulder, but ends up accepting their company. She tells them that she has a plan, not only to kill Oba, but to destroy him first. She sends Yukie and Natsuko to find out everything they can about the Oba Industries, and charges Kaoru with finding a safe place for them to hide.
Maki tells them that they'll meet again in a couple of weeks - while she flies to some island with a U.S. Military Base [Okinawa, not mentioned in dialogue], and makes big money by prostituting herself to American army officers, until she has enough money to buy a box with machine-guns and hand grenades, ""lost"" in the Army inventory.Kaoru is afraid of dealing with these weapons. Maki tells her that the Hamayasu clan owned that town until ten years ago, when all businesses were forcibly taken over by Oba and his gang. The Hamayasu clan reacted, and had several clashes with the Oba gang, until they were defeated in a big battle - shortly after Maki had been arrested. Yukie tells of her findings: an assemblyman named Kamejiro Tanno (Hôsei Komatsu), had imposed a truce, just before the Hamayasu gang had been wiped out. The Oba gang has the monopoly of drugs. Yukie points at photographs: Sugai (Seiya Satô), Hayami (Shinzô Hotta), Yabuki (Keiichi Kitagawa), and Ogata (Tooru Hanada). Maki wonders why the Oba gang did not finish with the Hamayasu, but Natsuko adds that they didn't care about their aging Boss, Yasutaro Hamada (Bontarô Miake), who has problems with his only son, Tetsu Hamada's (Takeo Chii), a no-good man, who spends his time at billiards and drinking. The girls agree that a good plan is to set the Oba and the Hayamasu gangs against each other.Symbolically, Maki picks Ogata's photo from the wall, and sets it afire with her lighter. Maki catches him alone in a rainy night, and stabs him to death. The other girls take her away in a car, and leave Yukie behind to give the alert, and provide Oba's men who appear quickly, with disinformation. Meanwhile, Boss Oba is having sex with... Masayo, nude but for the unmistakable tattoo on her body. He is interrupted by a henchman, who delivers the news of Ogata's death, and brings Yukie in, who plays her character of unwilling witness to the hilt. The men are convinced that Ogata had been killed by two or three men using a car, and leaves... after pick-pocketing the wallet of a henchman. However, she had been seen by Masayo...The two gang bosses meet, and Yasutaro Hamada promises to investigate if the murder had been commanded by his son. Oba and his men leave in two cars, only to have the road blocked by a construction truck. On top of the truck's cabin, laughing out loud, is Tetsu, who has two men with him. They throw a few large cans of gasoline on the road, and he lights them with two pistol shots. Oba is humiliated, and gives orders to kill Tetsuo. The four girls join him before he goes to see his father. They bring the box with guns, and ask for five million yen. And the girls came armed, to be on the safety side.Meanwhile, the Assemblyman presents the excuses for the gasoline incident to Oba, plus the promise of a profitable contract relating to an urban development project. That convinces Oba to accept a truce.Masayo interrupts a meeting of the four ex-con girls, in their secret place. To Maki's amazement, she came just to give advice: ""Maki, don't ask any questions. Just get out of town."" And at the insistent question, why, she reveals: ""Because I'm Oba's woman."" Before leaving, she stares Maki eye-to-eye, neither flinches, and it's clear that Maki is still bent on revenge, and Masayo is going to be loyal to her owner [sic] and protector, Oba.The girls have prepared an ambush, and Maki shoots Assemblyman Tanno, using a rifle with telescopic lenses. His bodyguards in the car are powerless, and never saw the women on top of a near-by building. Oba misinterprets this killing as the end of the truce that was in Tanno's hands, and sends a number of his men to attack and destroy the rival's headquarters. A gun fight takes place between the two clans. The attackers win. The old Boss dies, with his samurai sword in hand, and Tetsu is taken away through a back door by a handful of his men, who survived the massacre.Oba is pleased with a ""job well done"". Tetsu is eager to buy more ""pineapples"" from Maki...The girls lure a number of Oba's henchmen with their bodies, and dispose of them.Maki is not successful with her prey, though. While she is in the shower, he suspects her, and takes her prisoner to Oba's headquarters, where she is put in bonds, slapped, and menaced with an electric see-saw being used on a female card mannequin. With the cutting blade inches from her face, still Maki is not talking. Masayo intervenes, and uses her lighted cigarette on Maki's nipples. Maki screams many times, one for each burning pain on her bosom, while Oba watches. Then, she passes a knife into Maki's hands - tied behind her back - slaps her some more, and Oba decides to put an end to it.During the night, Oba's bodyguard who had captured Maki visits her in the basement, and cuts her ropes, intent to rape her. Maki forces him at knife point to tell her where and when the drugs for money exchange will take place, and then kills him. On the man's wristwatch, she sees how many hours she has to prepare her next move.Her three friends attack Oba's men at the dockyard, and mow down a number of them, before escaping with the suitcase with the drugs. Oba learns that a man found dead at the dockyard is Miyamoto (Hirohisa Nakata), an underling chief of the Hamayasu gang, thus he is more convinced that the attack it's Tetsu's doing.Maki appears, her wounds tended to, and hidden by a design dress, wearing platform sandals, telling him that indeed, she is working with Tetsu, her ""business partner"". She tells him that she sold the drugs to Tetsu, but she came to Oba because she wants more money - his money. Masayo is present, and the only one who's wise to Maki's plan, but she keeps quiet. Maki demands 30 million yen for the information about where Tetsu and the drugs - worth 300 million - are. Oba is undecided, but Masayo tells him that she thinks the girl is not lying and, ""If she is, I'll take care of her."" Upstairs, in the office, Maki places the three stacks of banknotes into her large suitcase, and says, ""You'll find Tetsu in the abandoned ship at the 13th reclaimed yard.""Oba and his men drive to the indicated place in four cars, and well armed. A first team rushes into the rusty ship, only to find it is empty. Tetsu comes out of a hiding place with his men, from where they dominate the barren land of the abandoned dockyard, and they start throwing grenades at Oba's men. Several go up in explosions. Then, Oba's men hide the best they can, and start shooting back. More men die in the gun fight. Tetsu dies in Oba's hands, but his last words prove that he knows nothing about Oba's drugs...Maki re-appears, in a new light beige jacket and trousers ensemble, and the suitcase with the drugs. Maki's three protecting angels appear with guns to shoot down the last of Oba's bodyguards, including Yabuki (Keiichi Kitagawa), whose specialty is spitting darts held in chewing gum. Oba is alone, and Maki tells her of her personal grievances against him. She pulls a gun, and shoots at him - six times, each bullet into one of his limbs, and the last two in each side of his forehead.Masayo steps towards Maki, ""This is not over yet"".
Maki counters, ""I knew you'd come.""
Masayo shows anger: ""How dare you make a complete fool of me?"" Masayo says she wants the money, as she had been with Oba just for it, the money. Maki refuses.Masayo had come prepared for this final set-to, with two flick-blades. She throws one at Maki, and opens hers. Maki sets the suitcase down, and opens hers, too. The knife fight starts, and Maki warns her three friends to stay out of it. Maki wounds Masayo's in the right wrist, and she has to drop the knife. Maki - replicating what Masayo had done in their first duel - drops her own knife, and strips her jacket. The two women continue their fight by punching, wrestling, kicking, pulling hair and delivering knee blows. At one point, Masayo falls close to the suitcase, and throws it at Maki's face. The suitcase falls open, revealing a number of sachets, some of which are ripped, and their white powder, drugs, set to waste by the breeze.[continuity error, betraying a cut scene: Masayo reappears with no jacket] The two fighting women are stumbling onto the sea-shore, and keep trading punches. They return to land, and exchange a couple of punches more, until both drop alongside each other, face up, on the white covered land - duplicating the end of their first duel. Both are breathing hard, exhausted, under the brilliant sun.Masayo concedes, ""You've become a truly ruthless woman. How dare you surpass me? You're like a viper.""
Maki recognizes, ""So then, you're still a rattlesnake? I don't think so. I know you're not easily beaten.""
They turn their faces toward each other, and they look deeply into each other's eyes.Yukie: ""Cut it out, you two. You've ruined a fortune's worth of dope... Speaking of ruthless women, every woman here is as ruthless as the devil.""
Kaoru: ""Five women like us together could take on the whole world.""
Natsuko: ""There are plenty of thugs left.""
Yukie: ""That's right!""
Natsuko: ""We'll chew 'em up, and spit'em out.""The three girls walk away with, carrying their weapons. Maki and Masayo stand up with some difficulty, and follow them. [theme song until The End]"
