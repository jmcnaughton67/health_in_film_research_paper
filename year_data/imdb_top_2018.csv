Teaming with the Dora Milaje, his little sister Shuri, and his CIA ally Everett K. Ross, T'Challa must harness the powers of the Black Panther to fight his enemy and save Wakanda from destruction.—Blazer346 A voice from a young boy asks to tell him a story. The adults voice tells the story of ""Vibranium."" A gigantic meteorite with the toughest metal: vibranium, crashed in the region of the sources of the Nile river, ""millions"" of years ago and it affected the plants. Later, in the age of humans, five tribes in the land named Wakanda battled for control of that vibranium until a spirit led a certain warrior to find and eat a ""heart-shaped herb"" affected by the metal. He gained superhuman abilities, and became the first ""Black Panther"". Four of the five tribes submit to his power but one tribe wants freedom. The Wakandans use the vibranium to develop highly-advanced technology. They see the horrors of the other nations and isolated themselves from the rest of the world. They hid and pretended that they are not industrially developed like a third world country.In Oakland, California, Prince N'Jobu (Sterling K. Brown) vows to share Wakandas technology with people of African descent around the world in order to help them conquer their oppressors. N'Jobu enlists black-market arms dealer Ulysses Klaue to infiltrate Wakanda and remove a cache of vibranium.In 1992, King T'Chaka learns of his brother's actions. He confronts N'Jobu, who becomes angry and threatens to kill T'Chaka's loyal friend, Zuri (Forest Whitaker). T'Chaka reluctantly kills N'Jobu to save Zuri, and abandons N'Jobu's son Erik in order to prevent the Wakandan people from learning the truth.In the present day, following T'Chaka's death at the hands of Helmut Zemo, disguised as a masked James Barnes, his son T'Challa returns to Wakanda to assume the throne. After working with Okoye, the leader of the all-female fighting force the Dora Milaje, to extract his ex-lover Nakia from an undercover assignment in Nigeria's Sambisa Forest, he reunites with his mother Queen Ramonda and younger sister Princess Shuri, the nation's current technological genius. At his kingship ceremony he is challenged for the crown by M'Baku, the leader of the fifth tribe, the mountain-dwelling Jabari. The two engage in ritual combat, with T'Challa emerging victorious and becoming the new King. He let's M'Baku live.In London, a gang led by Klaue and including an ex-U.S. black ops soldier, Erik Stevens a/k/a/ ""Killmonger,"" steals an ancient Wakandan vibranium ax from a museum. When the tribal elders receive word that Klaue has resurfaced in South Korea, T'Challa's friend W'Kabi, who lost his parents as a result of the dealer's actions, urges the young monarch to bring him to justice. T'Challa, Okoye, and Nakia plan to intercept Klaue at an underground casino in Busan, where he will be selling the ax to an unknown buyer. The plan, however, goes wrong when T'Challa discovers the buyer is CIA agent Everett Ross and Klaue suspects the deal is a setup.The deal subsequently goes sour, and a car chase ensues that culminates in Klaue's apprehension. While in CIA custody, however, Klaue is rescued by Killminger. Ross is seriously injured saving Nakia in the attack, and rather than pursue Klaue, T'Challa takes Ross to Wakanda where his sister Shuri uses the nation's advanced technology to save Ross' life.Killmonger kills Klaue and takes his body to Wakanda as a token, revealing his identity as N'Jobu's son to the tribal elders and challenging T'Challa for the throne. Killmonger triumphs in ritual combat and hurls the defeated T'Challa over a waterfall. After ingesting the heart-shaped herb to gain the powers of the Black Panther, Killmonger enacts his father's plan, preparing shipments of Wakandan weapons to be distributed to Wakandan operatives around the world. Nakia, Shuri, Ross, and T'Challa's mother Ramonda flee to seek the aid of the Jabari and learn M'Baku's men have found and are caring for the comatose T'Challa.Healed by a heart-shaped herb brought by Nakia, T'Challa returns to Wakanda and to renew his combat with Killmonger for the throne, which was never officially concluded since T'Challa never died or conceded. When Killmonger refuses to cooperate, his claim to the throne is immediately invalidated and Okoye and the Dora Milaje turn against him. However, Killmonger who is now wearing a suit of Black Panther armor of his own resists with force along with the Border Tribe. While Shuri, Nakia, and Jabari battle W'Kabi, Ross, piloting a remote jet with Shuri's guidance, shoots down the planes carrying the weapons before they can leave the country. The battle goes poorly for T'Challa's side until M'Baku and the Jabari arrive to support him, thus turning the tide. T'Challa and Killmonger's battle carries them into the heart of the vibranium mine, where sonic disrupted used in the transport of the metal incapacitate their vibranium armor. While Killmonger's body is briefly exposed, T'Challa stabs his cousin. He takes Killmonger to see the sunset of Wakanda and offers to heal him. But Killmonger states that he knows he will then be imprisoned and would rather die a free man. He pulls the dagger out of his chest and dies peacefully.With that victory, T'Challa is officially restored to the throne, with M'Baku granted a seat in the national tribal council to represent his tribe in recognition of his loyalty. Rejecting the isolationism of past Wakandan kings, T'Challa establishes an embassy in the United States to be run by Nakia and Shuri. In a mid-credits scene, T'Challa appears before the United Nations to reveal Wakanda's true nature to the world. In a post-credits scene, Shuri continues to help Bucky Barnes with his recuperation."

Facing an enemy too powerful to stop alone, the Avengers and the Guardians, alongside Doctor Strange, Black Panther, and Spider-Man must come together and stop Thanos from inflicting his power and destroying the universe.—Blazer346 Thanos and his Children - Proxima Midnight, Ebony Maw, Corvus Glaive and Cull Obsidian - have attacked Thor's Asgardian ship, the Statesman, in search of the Space Stone, which is housed in the Tesseract that Loki had stolen before Asgard's destruction. With Thanos already possessing the Power Stone after decimating Xandar, Thanos' army swiftly defeats the Asgardians. After a futile counter-attack from the Hulk, Loki offers the Tesseract to Thanos in exchange for Thor's life - only to be killed himself when Thanos anticipates Loki's attempt to betray and kill him. Moments before Glaive kills him, Heimdall uses the power of the Bifrost to send Hulk to Earth. Thanos and his Children then depart just after Thanos uses the Power stone to destroy the Statesman, leaving a mourning Thor behind and stranded in space.Hulk crash lands at the Sanctum Sanctorum in New York City and is reverts back to Bruce Banner, who informs Stephen Strange and Wong about Thanos' impending arrival. Strange and Banner contact Tony Stark and brief him about the Infinity Stones and Thanos. Realizing they must find Vision to protect the Mind Stone embedded in his head, Stark realizes he must make contact with Steve Rogers to find Vision, who has gone off the grid with Wanda Maximoff. Just then, Maw and Obsidian arrive in New York to seize the Time Stone from Strange, and Stark, Strange, Wong and Peter Parker confront them. Having been traumatized by his defeat at the hands of Thanos, Banner finds himself unable to transform into the Hulk and help in the battle. Maw incapacitates and captures Strange; Stark and Parker pursue his spaceship off Earth while Wong stays behind to protect the Sanctorum. Banner contacts the rest of the Avengers.In Scotland, where Wanda Maximoff and Vision have been hiding, the two are ambushed by Midnight and Glaive, but Steve Rogers, Natasha Romanoff and Sam Wilson fight them off. They decide to seek shelter in the Avengers Facility in Upstate New York, where they meet James Rhodes, who is once again mobile with bionic leg braces. Vision proposes that Maximoff destroy the Stone in his forehead to keep Thanos from retrieving it. Wanda immediately refuses however Rogers suggests that they travel to the one place that has the technology to safely remove the stone from Vision without killing him: Wakanda.Thor is rescued by the Guardians of the Galaxy, who had picked up the Asgardian ship's distress call. Thor guesses that Thanos would next be after the Reality Stone, which is in the possession of the Collector in Knowhere, but first he must retrieve a new weapon capable of killing Thanos from the dwarven planet of Nidavellir, where the only forge that can create such a weapon exists. Thor orders Rocket with him to Nidavellir, while Peter Quill, Gamora, Drax and Mantis travel to Knowhere. On the way there, Gamora talks to Quill, making him promise to kill her if the situation presents itself. Quill reluctantly promises he will. In Knowhere, Thanos ambushes the Guardians, having already retrieved the Reality Stone and created an illusion of an intact Knowhere to trap them.He captures Gamora after a crucial moment when Gamora begs Quill to kill her, using the Space Stone to escape. Thanos reveals that he knows that Gamora already knows the location of the Soul Stone after prying information from a tortured Nebula. Nebula escapes and signals the remaining Guardians to meet her on Titan, Thanos' home world. Thanos and Gamora travel to the planet of the Soul Stone, Vormir, where the Red Skull, the Stone's keeper, informs him that retrieving the Stone carries a heavy price: it can only be retrieved by sacrificing the life of someone he truly loves. Despite his reluctance, Thanos tearfully throws Gamora off a tall cliff to her death and is granted the Soul Stone.Stark and Parker rescue Strange from Maw's torture chamber, and launch Maw out of the ship, killing him. Strange believes they should retreat to protect the Time Stone but Stark disagrees; he believes they should take the fight to Thanos instead of retreating like they've done in the past. The three leave to confront Thanos on Titan, where they meet Quill, Drax and Mantis and formulate a plan to remove Thanos' gauntlet. While discussing their tactics, Strange uses the Time Stone to view alternate futures, telling them he'd seen 14,000,605 of them, with only one where the Avengers win. Thanos teleports to Titan, where, after a brief conversation with Strange meant to distract him, the group engage Thanos hand-to-hand and manage to subdue him. Mantis is able to calm Thanos while Peter and Tony attempt to pry the gauntlet from his arm. Quill and Nebula, who'd arrived on Titan during the battle, deduce that Gamora is dead; an enraged Quill retaliates, hitting Thanos and breaking the group's hold on him. Thanos takes the gauntlet back and defeats the group, threatening to kill Stark unless Strange gives him the Time Stone. Strange does so and tells Tony they've ""entered the end game."" Thanos adds the stone to his gauntlet and departs Titan.Thor, Rocket and Groot arrive at an abandoned and desolate Nidavellir. Thor is puzzled that the giant forge is inactive. The giant dwarf Eitri tells them that Thanos forced the dwarves to create his gauntlet; in return, Thanos killed all the dwarves except for Eitri. After laboring to reactivate the forge and reignite the neutron star that powers it, the four create Stormbreaker, a battle axe that serves as Thor's new weapon and grants him the power of the Bifrost. Meanwhile, the Avengers arrive in Wakanda and task Shuri with safely extracting the Mind Stone from Vision. Thanos' Outrider army arrives and begins attacking Wakanda, and the Avengers, alongside the united Wakandan armies led by King T'Challa, mount a defense against Thanos' forces. Glaive infiltrates Shuri's lab and attacks Vision. The Outriders begin overwhelming the defending armies before Thor, Rocket and Groot arrive to join the battle.The tide seems to be turning for the Avengers, Midnight, Obsidian and Glaive are killed, but Thanos arrives for the Mind Stone. A tearful Maximoff destroys the still-implanted Mind Stone in Vision to prevent Thanos from retrieving it, but Thanos uses the Time Stone to reverse the event and pry out the Mind Stone from Vision, killing him again. Thor attacks and drives Stormbreaker into Thanos' chest, but Thanos survives long enough to snap his fingers with the gauntlet. On a faraway world he finds Gamora as a child. When he confirms that he achieved his goal, she asks him what it cost. His answer is ""Everything."" Back on Earth, Thor looks on in horror as Thanos, his gauntlet now battered from the effort and his left arm and part of his chest burned, teleports away.Thanos' goal of eradicating half of all life in the universe comes to fruition as people begin disintegrating: Bucky Barnes, T'Challa, Groot, Maximoff, Wilson, Mantis, Drax, Star-Lord, Strange & Parker all turn to ash and fade away. In Wakanda, only Rogers, Thor, Banner, Romanoff, James Rhodes, Rocket, Okoye and M'Baku remain of the heroes.On Titan, only Nebula and Stark are left alive. Thanos awakens on another lush, green planet, his chest wound healed, and serenely watches the sunset, smiling slightly, satisfied at having achieved his ultimate goal.In a post-credits scene: the Earth is in chaos as people begin dissolving into ash; driver-less cars crash on the street and a helicopter is seen crashing into a skyscraper and exploding. Former S.H.I.E.L.D. Director Nick Fury and Deputy Director Maria Hill witness the scene on the street before they dissolve themselves. Before he vanishes, Fury manages to send a final distress signal to Captain Marvel."
Incredibles 2,2018,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3606756/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The Incredibles family takes on a new mission which involves a change in family roles: Bob Parr (Mr. Incredible) must manage the house while his wife Helen (Elastigirl) goes out to save the world. While the Parr family has accepted its collective calling as superheroes, the fact remains that their special heroism is still illegal. After they are arrested after unsuccessfully trying to stop the Underminer, their future seems bleak. However, the wealthy Deavor siblings of Devtech offer new hope with a bold project to rehabilitate the public image and legal status of Supers, with Elastigirl being assigned on point to be the shining example. Having agreed for now to stay home to look after the kids, Mr. Incredible finds domestic life a daunting challenge, especially when baby Jack-Jack's newly-emerged powers make him almost impossible to manage. However, Elastigirl has her own concerns dealing with the menace of a new supervillain, Screenslaver, who is wreaking havoc with his mind-control abilities. Elastigirl must solve the mystery of this enemy who has malevolent designs on the world, with the Parr family and friends key targets of this evil.—Kenneth Chisholm (kchishol@rogers.com) After the events ofThe Incredibles (2004), the extraordinary Parr family still balances between legality and illegality. And before long, they have a brush with Metroville's police after leaving a trail of destruction during an epic battle. But with the federal government shutting down the secret superhero program, upbeat benefactor and telecommunications tycoon Winston Deavor and his sister Evelyn approach the family to restore the Parrs' tarnished public image. However, only Elastigirl will get to be the campaign's new face. As a result, once-popular Mr Incredible now juggles his responsibilities as a parent at home, clearing the way for the invincible super-mum to confront the city's latest mega-villain. Can the Incredibles handle the new reality?—Nick Riganas Now accepting the fact they are superheroes, the Parr family still know that heroism is illegal according to the established law that prevents them from helping people. But their lives in hiding are cut short when a wealthy philanthropist approaches Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl with the idea to remove the law and make their heroic acts legal. And Elastigirl is chosen to help lead this plan, leaving Mr. Incredible in charge of the kids. Things get even more complicated when a terrifying new menace called the Screenslaver shows up and threatens to abolish Elastigirl's attempt to restore heroism. Who is the Screenslaver? Can the Parrs save the world from chaos and destruction? Can the heroic freedom be restored?—Blazer346 Agent Rick Dicker (Jonathan Banks) is interviewing a boy named Tony Rydinger. Tony tells him how he met up with a classmate named Violet Parr (Sarah Vowell) at a track meet, and they agreed to go on a date together. Later, in the parking lot, a supervillain who called himself the Underminer (John Ratzenberger) burrowed up through the ground and said he was declaring war on peace and happiness. Everyone else scattered, but Tony found himself with no easy escape route, so he ducked behind a car and watched what unfolded. He saw a family of superheroes in matching suits, and the mother told one of the kids to patrol the perimeter and keep people away, and the other one to watch the baby, Jack-Jack. As the parents went after the Underminer, Tony saw an opportunity to escape, but then he recognized the voice of the girl. The boy ran off with super speed to do perimeter duty, leaving her alone with the baby. Frustrated, she ripped off her mask and threw it on the ground. Then Tony saw that she was Violet. Seeing him looking at her, she walked up to him and tried to explain, but he just ran away. He tells Rick that he feels bad about what he did, and he wishes he could just forget ever seeing Violet in her super suit.The Underminer bored back into the ground, setting off an underground explosion that caused bank buildings to collapse into the ground. Drilling through the vaults, he used a tube with vacuum suction to grab cash from the vaults. Mr. Incredible (Craig T. Nelson) confronts him, and the Underminer turns toward him, sucking him into the tube. He landed in the tunneler's storage vault and banged his way out with super strength. The Underminer puts the borer on autopilot, and the two of them fought. Mr. Incredible pushed the Underminer into the borer's control panel, smashing it. The Underminer jumped into the vault and escaped, leaving Mr. Incredible to deal with the now out-of-control drill. It burst through the surface into the street. Dash (Huck Milner) saw a dust cloud in the distance and ran toward it, with Violet pushing Jack-Jack in his stroller and running after Dash. Elastigirl (Holly Hunter) stretched herself from one building to another, catching up to the careening drill. It slammed into a support column, destroying the monorail track right as a vehicle approached. Suddenly, their friend Frozone (Samuel L. Jackson) glided in and made a track that guided the monorail safely to the ground. The borer was still running down the street, scraping the sides of buildings along the way. The drill hit a car and flung it into the air, and Dash ran up to an old woman and pulled her out of the way just before the car crashed down. Violet caught up to him and handed off Jack-Jack in the stroller. Elastigirl stretched herself out across an overpass, stopping cars from getting on a bridge as the drill destroyed the supports. Mr. Incredible grabbed a fallen streetlamp and threw it into the treads, but it soon snapped. Dash ran up to him and put Jack-Jack in his hands. Violet threw up force fields to protect bystanders from the machine. Mr. Incredible ran past her and handed Jack-Jack back to her. Elastigirl jumped into the open hatch of the borer, with the rest of the family chasing after it. They saw that it was heading straight for City Hall. Elastigirl stretched out through the engine, trying to spill the coolant so it would overheat. Mr. Incredible jumped in and helped her, and they stopped the drill just short of City Hall. Violet and Dash jumped in, and she put a force field around the whole family just before the engine blew. Looking out the hatch, they saw themselves surrounded by cops with their guns drawn.Rick Dicker gives the family a ride, and Violet tells them that Tony had seen her without her mask. Rick brings them to the hotel room where they've been staying since their house had been destroyed. Rick tells them that the Super Relocation Program has been shut down, and he can only let them stay in the hotel for two more weeks, after which they'll be on their own. They say goodbye to him, and sit down at the table to eat Chinese takeout. Violet asks them if they're going to talk about the day's events. Helen tells them that things are different now, with supers being forbidden to do hero work. Violet asks if that means they're going to go back to never using their powers. After going back and forth, Helen slams her hand down on the table, ending the conversation. Later that night, after the kids fell asleep, Bob and Helen are sitting at the hotel pool, wondering what they're going to do. Helen tells him that one of them will have to get a regular job. Suddenly, Lucius shows up, and he offers to let the family move in with himself and his wife, Honey (Kimberly Adair Clark) after their time in the hotel is up. Then he tells them that during the Underminer attack, a man who represents the business tycoon Winston Deavor (Bob Odenkirk) handed him a business card, and said that Winston wanted to talk to Lucius, Bob and Helen. With no other options, they agree to the meeting.The three of them show up outside a huge building, the headquarters of DevTech. They get security badges and take the elevator to the top floor, and are greeted by Winston. A woman also walks up and Winston introduces her as his sister, Evelyn (Catherine Keener). He tells them he saw what they did with their kids earlier, and they shoot each other a look, realizing he knows their secret identities. He says he used to work for Rick years ago, before the Supers were forced into hiding, and he explains that Rick was a huge fan of them. Rick had a direct phone line installed in the Deavor house, so they could call the Supers any time they needed them. Winston tells them that one night thieves broke into their house, and his father tried to call Gazerbeam and Fironic, but since Supers had been outlawed, neither one of them answered. The thieves found his dad and shot him. A few months later, Winston's mom died from heartbreak. He says that if the Supers hadn't been in hiding, it never would have happened. Evelyn counters that her dad should've hidden himself at the first sign of trouble, and Winston explains that they've had that argument forever. Since then, Winston and Evelyn built DevTech, a telecommunications company, with the goal of righting some wrongs. Winston and Evelyn explain that the Supers have been in hiding because of the people's perception. All they see is the destruction the Supers cause, not the hard decisions they make or the lives they save. To change that, Evelyn shows them that there are cameras in their badges, and says their new super suits will have cameras as well. Winston says they just need to be super, and he'll make sure they'll all be legal again some day. Enthusiastically, Bob asks what their first assignment will be, but Winston says that Elastigirl should be the first Super that the public sees in action. Bob reluctantly agrees, but Helen is still unsure.Back at the hotel, Bob asks Helen why she wouldn't want to take the opportunity, and she explains that the children will need her. Dash is struggling with math, and Violet is nervous about her upcoming date with Tony. Jack-Jack, being a baby, will naturally need lots of attention, whether he has powers or not. Neither of them knew that he had used his powers once before, to escape from being kidnapped by Syndrome, since at the time they were on the ground and he was high in the air, beyond their sight. Bob tells her that the choice is to change the world to allow their children to be who they are, or to possibly soon be homeless. She asks if he'll be okay watching the kids, and he says he can handle it with no problem. Lying down to sleep, they knew tomorrow they'd tell Winston that Elastigirl was in.Winston sends a limo to pick up the family and take them to a huge house that he owns, and he says they can stay as long as they need. Later, Elastigirl comes out of the bathroom wearing her new super suit, one that was designed by Alexander Galbaki. Bob teases her that when Edna Mode (Brad Bird) finds out, she won't be happy. Helen finds a note from Evelyn saying there's something in the garage for her. She goes out and finds a motorcycle that can split into two parts. Bob watches as she takes off down the street. The next morning, Bob fixes breakfast for the kids, and Violet asks him if Helen is breaking the law by doing hero work. Bob is relieved to see the school bus pull up, and sends the kids off.That night, Violet gets ready for her date with Tony. Bob reads Jack-Jack a bedtime story, and the baby falls asleep. Bob then tries to help Dash with his math homework, but Dash tells him they want the problems done a certain way, and then says he'll just wait until Helen comes home. The TV turns on, and Bob is surprised to see Jack-Jack sitting on the couch. He takes him back up to his room and reads another story.In the city, Elastigirl is in attendance at the unveiling ceremony of a new hovertrain. The mayor gives a speech as the Deavors watch in a studio through Helen's bodycam. The mayor cut the ribbon, and the train got its first group of passengers. It lifts up and suddenly takes off in the wrong direction. Elastigirl jumps on her cycle and takes off after it. Riding through tunnels and on rooftops, she is able to land on top of the train. Before she can plan her next move, the train goes into a tunnel. She ditches the bike and flattens herself on the roof. She reaches the engineer and finds him staring straight ahead. Coming out of the tunnel, Elastigirl makes herself into a parachute and slows the train to a stop. Going back to the engineer, she notices a pulsing light in his cabin. A message appears on a monitor saying ""Welcome back, Elastigirl--The Screenslaver""Bob keeps trying to get Jack-Jack to stay in his bed, with no luck. Going downstairs, he finds Violet, who never left for her date, and she tells him not to say anything. Bob goes back to the living room and sits Jack-Jack down next to him and falls asleep. On the TV, a movie is playing with a masked robber holding a man at gunpoint. Jack-Jack sees the masked man, and then looks out the window and sees a raccoon rummaging through the trash. He walks up to the window and is able to pass through it with his powers. Grabbing a half-eaten chicken leg away from the raccoon, he throws it back in the garbage can and uses another power to lift the lid with his mind and slam it down on the can. Then laser beams come out of his eyes, just missing the raccoon. Bob wakes up from the commotion and goes outside to grab Jack-Jack. Just then, the baby split into six separate copies of himself. Bob realizes that Jack-Jack has multiple superpowers. Taking Jack-Jack back inside, Bob gets a call from Helen. She asks him how things are going, and he lies and says the kids are just fine. She tells him about saving the runaway train, and he turns on the TV to see news reports about the dramatic rescue. She thanks him for taking care of the kids, and they hang up. Bob puts Dash and Jack-Jack to bed, and then cracks open Dash's math book. Later, he wakes up Dash and tells him that he understands the math problems and can help Dash before school starts.Elastigirl is getting ready to be interviewed by a news anchor named Chad Brentley. Chad is interviewing a foreign ambassador as Helen sits in a green room, nervously waiting for her turn. A stage hand comes in and walks her toward the stage. The ambassador sees Helen and greets her enthusiastically. Chad introduces Elastigirl to the audience, and she walks out to the stage. Suddenly, Chad's eyes glaze over and he starts talking in a robotic monotone. Following his eyes, Helen notices a blinking light on a screen. She looks away just in time to avoid being hypnotized herself. Chad says that everyone is being controlled by screens. Helen makes her way to the control room, where she finds everyone staring ahead blankly. The robotic voice continues, saying that the screens are being controlled by the Screenslaver. The voice says the Screenslaver will hijack the ambassador's aerocade, and Helen runs and smashes a window. Stretching herself out of the building, she climbs on a rooftop and sees three helicopters airborne. Launching herself like a slingshot, she crashes through one of the helicopters' windows, but the ambassador isn't there. She tells the pilot to get her close to another copter, and she makes the jump. Finding the ambassador in the back, she breaks open the door to the cockpit and sees the pilots in a trance. She smashes the screen with the blinking light to bring them back. Just then, the third chopper smashes into them. Struggling to gain control, she asks the pilots if they can swim, then pushes them out so they land in the river below. Then she grabs the ambassador and slings herself into the air, making a parachute to bring the ambassador safely to the ground.The next morning, Bob is getting the kids ready for school. Violet looks awful and tells him that yesterday at school, she asked Tony why he stood her up, and he acted like he didn't know her at all. Bob tells her that Rick has had to erase many people's memories after they found out his or Helen's secret identity. Violet realizes that Rick had erased Tony's memory, after Bob told him to. Stomping off, she grabs her super suit and stuffs it in the garbage disposal and turns it on. But since the suit is indestructible, nothing happens to it. Angrily, she grabs it and throws it against the wall, vowing never to be a hero again.Helen is in a limousine, being given a ride back to the DevTech building. There, a group of people cheer for her, making her feel proud, but she knows the Screenslaver is still out there. Inside, Winston hands her a newspaper that has a headline about the ambassador giving a pro-Super speech, and he tells her their plan is working. She tries to be enthusiastic, but she's still worried about the Screenslaver. He leads her into a room filled with other superheroes in costume. One of the women introduces herself as Voyd (Sophia Bush), and demonstrates her power to make portals that can instantly transport people or things anywhere. Other supers come up and introduce themselves as Screech, Brick, Reflux and He-lectric. They all chatted a while, and Helen is proud of the positive effect she's had on them. Talking with Evelyn, Helen hits upon a plan to lure the Screenslaver out. Evelyn will make a tracking device, and while Chad interviews Helen remotely, they'll track the signal.Bob calls Rick and asks him if he remembers wiping Tony's memory, then explains that he went too far, erasing all memory of Violet from his mind. Rick replies that memory wiping isn't an exact science. Bob asks Rick for any information he has about Tony, and Rick tells him that Tony's parents own a restaurant where he works after school. That night, Bob takes the kids out to dinner. Violet wonders why he's taking them across town to one specific restaurant. Sitting down at the table, they're greeted by their waiter, Tony. Startled, Violet shoots water out of her nose, and Tony offers her napkins to clean herself up. Bob tries to push Violet into chatting with Tony, but she just gets more embarrassed and angry. She pushes herself away from the table and walks out of the restaurant.At the station, Chad is talking with Helen through a monitor, and she tells him that she's at a secure, undisclosed location. She's actually on top of the building, on a transmission tower. Chad shows footage from the hovertrain rescue, when the Screenslaver appears on the monitors. Activating her tracker, Helen locates the source of the signal. The Screenslaver rants about how people are controlled by screens because they're lazy. Meanwhile, Elastigirl vaults from one building to another, zeroing in on the source. Finally, she arrives at an apartment building. Snaking her arm under the door, she unlocks it and runs in. The Screenslaver appears behind her and pushes her and himself into a giant cage, then zaps her with a taser. He turns on blinking lights to hypnotize her, but she manages to push him out of the cage and slither out herself. They fight around the room, then he runs out the door, activating a timer on the way out. She runs after him, and he activates a fire alarm, causing others to come running out. He slips down an elevator shaft and onto a rooftop, with Helen in pursuit. Suddenly, he leaps off the roof. Helen jumps after him, grabs him and makes a parachute. As the timer hits zero, the building blows up, and she reaches up and grabs the mask off his face. On the ground, he's led away in handcuffs by the police, acting confused. Helen thanks Evelyn for setting up the tracker.Back at the house, Dash asks Bob for help with his new math lesson. Watching TV, Bob sees a story about how a car called the Incredible, a car he once owned when he was a public superhero, had been bought by a billionaire at an auction. Thinking the car had been destroyed along with his house, Bob angrily rummages through some boxes and finds the old remote control for the car. Pressing a button, he makes the car start on the screen. Dash snatches the remote and starts pressing buttons. Everyone in the studio takes cover from the seemingly live car. Bob grabs the remote back and powers it down. Suddenly Jack-Jack sneezes and teleports himself into Violet's room. She runs down the stairs screaming, as Jack-Jack now has turned into a red monster, chasing after her. Jack-Jack turns back into his normal self, and Dash and Violet realize he has powers, and Bob hadn't told them. Violet asks if he told Helen, and he says no. When she asks why, he angrily tells them that he's Mr. Incredible, and he's trying to hold the house together through everything. Taken aback, Violet says that she's going to call Lucius.Lucius comes over, and he sees Jack-Jack suddenly turn invisible. Weary, Bob grabs cookies and holds one up to lure Jack-Jack out. He reappears, grabs the cookie and munches on it. Bob tells Lucius that he can't keep giving Jack-Jack cookies, but when he stops, the red monster appears and starts biting Bob's arm. Desperate for some relief, Bob takes Jack-Jack and drives up to Edna's house. Seeing him looking like he hadn't slept in days, she invites him in. He tells her that he needs some alone time, and asks if he can leave Jack-Jack with her. Jack-Jack looks at her face and transforms his own nose to look like hers. Bit by bit, he transforms the rest of his face to match her. Fascinated by his powers, she agrees to take him and quickly shoves Bob out the door. Bob goes back to the house and collapses on the sofa. He apologizes to Violet for having Rick erase Tony's memory, then making things worse at the restaurant. He says he's just trying to be a good dad, and Violet replies that he's not good, he's super. She hugs him, before realizing that he fell asleep sitting up.At the Deavors' house, a party was going with video playing of Elastigirl catching the Screenslaver. Winston announces that Supers will be legal again, and he triumphantly holds up the Screenslaver's suit and goggles, saying that Elastigirl is the one who made it all possible. He says they'll sign an agreement on his ship, the Everjust, and it will be televised around the world. Helen rewatches the footage of the Screenslaver capture, and she realizes that something isn't quite right. She slips away to the control room and watches some of the raw footage. Evelyn comes in behind her with drinks, happy to be away from the crowd. She tells Helen that her brother knows how to handle people, but she herself never knows what they want. Helen asks her what she thinks they want, and she replies that people value ease more than anything. Helen tells her that she thinks catching the Screenslaver was too easy, then she notices that one of the Screenslaver's monitors is tuned into her suit camera. Evelyn says that he must have hacked into the closed circuit, but Helen replies that if he was able to do that, he wouldn't just have simple locks on his door. She realizes that he himself must have been hypnotized by the goggles he was wearing, and she grabs the goggles to inspect them. With a swift move, Evelyn forces the goggles onto Helen's head.Bob wakes up groggy, and realizes he had been sleeping on the couch. Violet took off his shoes and gave him a blanket and pillow. Later, he goes to Edna's house and thanks her for watching Jack-Jack. She says that she stayed up all night, working on a suit that will control all of his powers. Putting Jack-Jack into the testing chamber, she shows Bob how Jack-Jack's suit can anticipate which of his powers he's about to use. When Jack-Jack turns into a flame, the suit activates an extinguisher with blackberry-flavored fire retardant spraying all over him, and he happily licks it up. Relieved at finally having some control, Bob takes Jack-Jack and puts him in the car.As the blinking lights in the goggles go out, Helen wakes from her trance, finding herself strapped to a chair. Trying to move, she lets out a scream of pain. Evelyn comes on the intercom and tells her that the temperature around her is below freezing, and that if she tries to stretch, she'll break. Helen realizes that Evelyn is the real Screenslaver, and the person she locked away was an innocent victim. Helen tells Evelyn that she counted on her, and Evelyn asks her why, because she built her a bike? Evelyn says that they didn't really know each other. Helen asks about her brother, and Evelyn replies that he's weak, depending on the Supers to always save him, just like his father did. Helen asks if she's going to kill her, and Evelyn says that she plans to use her instead.Back at the house, the kids see Jack-Jack in his new suit. Bob demonstrates how he can now control the baby, with Jack-Jack using his laser eyes on command. Then Jack-Jack uses his warp power to disappear, and Bob shows them a device to scan for his location. Seeing him in the corner, Dash holds out a cookie, which Jack-Jack reappears to grab and chomp down. The phone rings, and Evelyn tells Bob that Helen is in trouble. She says she doesn't want to say what happened on the phone, and it's best if he meets her at DevTech, where the ship is docked. Bob immediately calls Lucius and tells him to watch the kids, and to bring his super suit, since things might get weird. Suspicious at Bob's sudden leaving, Dash runs and grabs the car's remote control, and Violet gets out the super suits and has them all put the suits on. The doorbell rings, and they open it to see the other supers from the party, all being controlled with a pair of goggles.Voyd tells them that they're not safe, and the Deavors sent them for protection. Just then, Frozone runs up and stands between them and the kids, telling them they're not needed. He tries to shut the door, but they block him. Dash presses a button on the remote, activating the Incredible, which blasts out of its garage and flies toward the house. Frozone blasts the Supers with an ice wall and slams the door. Dash grabs Jack-Jack as the Supers force their way in. Dash tries to run outside, but he keeps finding himself still inside the house, thanks to Voyd's portals. As Frozone is fighting Screech, Violet creates a force field around herself and her brothers to shield them from He-lectrix's zapping blasts. As Krushauer tries to crush the force field, the Incredible flies in and stops just before them. Dash and Violet get in and escape, but the other Supers grab Frozone and put a pair of goggles on his head.Evelyn takes Bob to see Helen on the ship, and as soon as he walks in, Helen starts punching him in the face. Stunned at first, Bob tries to fight back, but he can't bring himself to attack his wife. As she comes at him with more punches and kicks, he grabs her and tries to break her trance. She kisses him, and with surprise, he kisses back. Then she stretches and grabs a pair of goggles from Evelyn and puts them on his head.Evelyn tells Winston that the heroes are on the ship, resting, and he orders the ship to head out. In the Incredible, Dash and Violet take a moment to decide what to do. They realize they have only themselves, the car and Jack-Jack. They get to the DevTech building and see the ship take off. Dash wishes the car could follow the ship, and it drives itself off the dock and into the water. Jetting itself along, the car quickly catches up to the ship. Violet asks how they'll get on the ship, and Dash replies that it would be great if the car had ejector seats. A message flashes across the dashboard, ""Ejector seats activated."" Suddenly they find themselves flying through the air toward the ship. Violet surrounds them with a force field, allowing them to land safely on deck. Just then, Winston activates the ship's hydrofoil, causing it to float out of the water. Evelyn has Winston gather the supers in a room for the signing ceremony. Violet sees them go into the room, then comes back to Dash to find that Jack-Jack had gone missing. Using the tracker, they find him going up in an elevator. They go to follow, but are cut off by Voyd, who attacks Violet. She tries to fight back by using force fields, but Voyd keeps opening portals to deflect them. Dash takes off after Jack-Jack, but he realizes Violet isn't behind him, so he runs back and speed-punches Voyd before she can put goggles on Violet.The kids find Jack-Jack in a hall and grab him. With the other Supers coming behind, they hide in a vent. Trying to keep Jack-Jack quiet, they give him the tracker to play with. Hearing Jack-Jack coo, Krushauer uses his power to crush the vent. Getting angry, Jack-Jack transforms into a giant baby and bursts out of the vent, knocking out Krushauer and destroying the tracker. Violet uses a cookie to calm Jack-Jack, who grabs it and goes smashing through the walls, heading toward the room where the Supers are gathered. Turning back to his normal size, he teleports through the last wall. Dash and Violet look for another way in. As the signing ceremony goes live, Evelyn takes control of all of the Supers, having them tell the world that they don't serve the people anymore, only themselves. They reach toward the camera, and the feed goes dead.Back at the studio, Chad awkwardly tells the audience to stand by as they sort out their technical issues. On the ship, Evelyn watches as Mr. Incredible, Elastigirl and Frozone lock the delegates in the room with the other Supers. They head up to the bridge and quickly disarm a guard, who gets on his radio and exclaims that Supers have taken the ship. Elastigirl turns the steering wheel, guiding the ship on a path toward the city. Mr. Incredible crushes the wheel, rendering the ship unsteerable. Dash and Violet follow Jack-Jack to the bridge, and without hesitation, their parents and Frozone attack them. Violet throws up a force field for protection, and Jack-Jack floats through the air, landing in Elastigirl's arms. With her momentarily confused, Jack-Jack reaches up and rips off her goggles. Evelyn orders Mr. Incredible and Frozone to grab her, but she rips off their goggles.The other Supers burst in and attack, and Jack-Jack transforms into a monster. Elastigirl is surprised to see that he has powers. He-lectrix tries to attack Violet, but monster Jack-Jack rips off his goggles. Soon, all the goggles are off and the Supers stop fighting, but the ship is still heading for the city. Evelyn grabs Winston and heads for a jet. Bob tells Helen to go after her, to finish the mission, while they handle the ship. Bob goes for the engine compartment, but is confronted by Krushauer, still wearing a pair of goggles. He tries to crush Bob with the walls, but he quickly jumps out of the way and hurls a piece of debris at Krushauer, knocking off his goggles. Krushauer is free from his trance, but now the room is filled with debris, blocking his entrance to the engine room. Winston is coming out of his camera-induced trance, and he realizes his sister is the Screenslaver. She pulls him into the jet, but he jumps out before she takes off. Running back to the room, he turns off the screen that was keeping everyone hypnotized, and orders them all to the back of the ship. Elastigirl and Voyd go to the deck and see Evelyn taking off. Voyd opens a portal for Elastigirl to use, and she lands on top of the jet. She forces her way in, and Evelyn starts flying wildly, flinging Elastigirl all around the cabin. Elastigirl makes her way to the pilot's chair and is about to punch Evelyn, but she puts an oxygen mask on herself and starts climbing rapidly. With the air getting thinner, Elastigirl starts to feel weak.On the ship, Mr. Incredible tells the others that he can't stop the ship, and Dash suggests turning it from the outside. Frozone freezes one of the foils, causing it to break and sending the ship back down to the water. Mr. Incredible lowers the anchor, wrapping himself in the chain. He gets plunged into the water, with Dash waiting for him to turn the rudder. As time passes, Dash gets increasingly worried. But then, the ship starts to turn, and Dash presses the button to lift the anchor.On the jet, Evelyn kicks Elastigirl in the face. Spotting a flare gun, Elastigirl fires it at Evelyn's oxygen tank, creating an explosion that sends Evelyn flying out the window. Elastigirl puts the jet on autopilot, swings out the window, grabs Evelyn and makes a parachute. Refusing to be saved by a Super, Evelyn kicks herself free and starts falling again, but Elastigirl grabs her again and Voyd opens a portal over the water, depositing them both safely on the ship's deck.With the ship turning away from the city, a large wave gets kicked up. Frozone freezes it to create a cushion for the side of the ship to run into. As such, even though the ship runs aground into the city on a sideways trajectory, it is otherwise brought safely to a stop without significant injury or property damage. Helen turns to Bob and asks if she missed Jack-Jack's first power, and he says more like the first seventeen. Evelyn is led into a police car in handcuffs, and she tells Helen that saving her life doesn't make them right, but Helen is unfazed at her enemy's remark. Bob tells Violet that she should try introducing herself to Tony again. Days later, a judge rules that Supers should be made legal again. At school, Violet walks up to Tony and introduces herself. They chat for a while, getting to know each other again.One night, Tony walks out of his door and into a car where the Parr family is sitting. They all head off to a theater together. When they get there, they see a group of police cars chasing down a criminal. Violet gets Tony out of the car, hands him money for tickets and popcorn, and tells him to save her a seat. Confused, Tony does as ordered. Violet gets back in the car, and they all put on their suits and masks. Bob pushes a button, transforming the car into a family sized Incredi-wagon. Bob hits the gas, and the family sets off on another adventure together."
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,2018,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4881806/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"When the island's dormant volcano begins roaring to life, Owen and Claire mount a campaign to rescue the remaining dinosaurs from this extinction-level event. Three years after the Jurassic World theme park was closed down, Owen and Claire return to Isla Nublar to save the dinosaurs when they learn that a once dormant volcano on the island is active and is threatening to extinguish all life there. Along the way, Owen sets out to find Blue, his lead raptor, and discovers a conspiracy that could disrupt the natural order of the entire planet. Life has found a way, again.—Jake Logsdon Determined to rescue the remaining dinosaurs that now roam free on Isla Nublar's vast landscapes after the events ofJurassic World (2015), Owen Grady and Claire Dearing return to the now-ruined theme park. However, significant volcanic activity and devious machinations threaten the rare natural habitat and the survival of the living prehistoric animals. Now, time is the enemy. Can the rescue team escape from the clutches of genetically enhanced hybrids and save the fallen kingdom?—Nick Riganas Six months after the demise of the Jurassic World theme park on Isla Nublar, a group of mercenaries are sent to Isla Nublar to recover the bones of the Indominus Rex from the Jurassic World lagoon for the creation of a new genetically modified hybrid: the Indoraptor. A submersible is sent down to retrieve the bones, and it sends them up on a buoy before it is attacked by the Mosasaurus. The people on land who opened the gate to the lagoon lose contact with the submarine pilots. The gate starts to close and a Dilophosaurus can be heard running away in the jungle. The trees nearby shake and Jurassic World's veteran Tyrannosaurus Rex attacks the group. Jack (Robert Emms) is left on the ground and their helicopter lets down a rope ladder. They escape the Tyrannosaurus, but Jack is then swallowed by the Mosasaurus after it jumps into the air and escapes from its enclosure.It then cuts to the mainland, in the year 2018, where Claire Dearing (Bryce Dallas Howard), the former park manager, has now founded the Dinosaur Protection Group, an organization dedicated to saving and protecting dinosaurs. After the government refuses to fund a rescue operation to save the dinosaurs, alongside Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum), Claire meets Benjamin Lockwood (James Cromwell), an old business partner of John Hammond, who agrees to fund the rescue mission and bring the dinosaurs to a new sanctuary island where they will be left to live on their own, safe from human interference. Lockwood's assistant, Eli Mills (Rafe Spall), asks Claire to recruit Owen Grady (Chris Pratt), a former raptor trainer who worked at the park, to find and capture Blue, the last surviving Velociraptor. Claire recruits Owen to help her rescue the remaining dinosaurs from the island.Claire and Owen then set off on a charter plane with Zia Rodriguez (Daniella Pineda), a paleo-veterinarian, and Franklin Webb (Justice Smith), an IT expert, both from the Dinosaur Protection Group. Once their plane lands, the group is surprised to find a large base camp has already been set up, and they are met by Ken Wheatley (Ted Levine), a big game and trophy hunter. They all set off along with a group of mercenaries to reactivate an abandoned radio communications tower that they will use to find the dinosaurs via their RFID chip implants. Along the way while passing through the Jurassic World main street, they encounter a Brachiosaurus.Owen, Zia, Wheatley, and some of the mercenaries go to find Blue. Owen suggests that he set out on his own to find Blue, and the others stay behind at the truck. When Owen comes upon the fallen Explorer 04 near the old Tyrannosaur Paddock from the first Jurassic Park, Blue jumps out and Owen tries to bond with her before she is tranquilized by Wheatley and his mercenaries. Angry, Blue tackles a mercenary and kills him but not before drawing his sidearm and shooting her, much to Wheatley's and Owen's dismay. Owen tries to attack Wheatley but Wheatley tranquilizes him and threatens to shoot Zia. Zia says that she is the only one who can keep Blue alive and Wheatley has his men put their weapons down.Mt. Sibo erupts, causing the mercenaries protecting Claire and Franklin to panic and drive off, locking them inside the old communications center. A Baryonyx surprises them by crawling through an old tunnel, but is temporarily held at bay by falling lava. Franklin and Claire narrowly escape through an emergency ladder and lock the Baryonyx inside the communications center. Owen awakes from his unconsciousness but is still mostly immobile. He is surprised by a Sinoceratops, which plays with him for a little while before getting scared off and running away from the approaching lava which crawls toward Owen but he manages to (barely) escape just before he is engulfed by the lava. He runs into Claire and Franklin and yells at them repeatedly to ""Run"", the three elude the lava and falling debris and magma bombs while avoiding getting trampled by the stampeding dinosaurs.Franklin and Claire both hide inside a Gyrosphere, when a Carnotaurus appears and fights a Sinoceratops, before being pinned down and killed by the T. Rex who also makes a run for it. Franklin, Claire, and Owen make a run from the burning ash, Owen is slowed down a bit by the ash, but Claire and Franklin fall off the edge with several other dinosaurs. The magma bombs break the Gyrosphere, and Claire and Franklin almost drown, but are able to survive when Owen opens one of the doors using his survival knife. Crawling up on the beach, they see several of the dinosaurs, such as the Baryonyx and T. Rex all being captured, The mercenaries on the ship called the Arcadia begin caging all of the captured dinosaurs, Wheatley takes a pair of pliers and yanks a tooth out of a tranquilized Stegosaurus, Owen, Claire, and Franklin also see Blue being tended to by Zia who has been captured, then the three use a truck to drive on the ship, which is leaving the island, they only barely make it, and watch the island burn up in the background. A trapped Brachiosaurus calls out to the departing ship before being engulfed by the ash and perishing.Eli is disappointed by the lack of progress, and meets with Gunnar Eversol (Toby Jones), an auctioneer who plans to sell the dinosaurs with for money. Lockwood's apparent granddaughter Maisie (Isabella Sermon) overhears their conversation and learns of their plan. Eli takes Gunnar to a lab, where he reveals that they are creating a new dinosaur with Indominus Rex, Smurfette's clay model and Velociraptor called the Indoraptor, and potentially other improvements in its wake for the sake of military interests and warfare. With the current one being a prototype, and their plan to use it for militaristic purposes. Maisie attempts to tell Benjamin, but he seemingly believes she misheard them and sends her off to bed.Owen, Claire, and Franklin meet up with Zia, who believes they need Blue for something; Zia further tells them that before she can treat Blue's gunshot wound, she needs a ready blood transfusion for Blue just in case. Unfortunately (much to Claire's charging), the only blood match on the ship would belong to a tranquilized T. Rex on board and inside one of the transport trucks, so Zia sends both Owen and Claire to retrieve some of the live dinosaur's blood. They find the Tyrannosaur and successfully get her blood but are locked in by some of the guards as the T. Rex wakes up. As the agitated animal begins to freak out and thrash violently, Claire escapes through the top and opens the main doors of the cage; Owen narrowly escapes the T. Rex's snapping jaws before she can bite him in half. The crew gives the blood to Blue before they make a dash; unfortunately, Franklin is caught and mistaken for a mercenary, and is forced to help transfer the dinosaurs to Lockwood Manor. Owen and Claire sneak into a truck but are discovered by Wheatley and imprisoned in the basement of Lockwood Manor.Maisie, having observed Mills entering the entrance code for the mansion's elevator the previous day, secretly enters the laboratory and watches several clips of Owen training the Velociraptors on Isla Nublar. Her exploration is interrupted by Mills and Dr. Henry Wu (BD Wong); the latter is extremely stressed about Blue's condition. Maisie, in an attempt to escape the two men, backs into a corridor and encounters the caged Indoraptor, who reaches out and gently strokes her hair from behind. Maisie screams, alerting the attention of Mills, who angrily escorts her upstairs and locks her in her bedroom.Lockwood confronts Mills about the latter's true intention of selling the dinosaurs in an auction, angered that Mills has crossed him and used his own mansion as the auction's venue. Ordered by Lockwood to call the police himself, Mills instead murders Lockwood by smothering him with a pillow.Bidders soon arrive for a dinosaur auction and place their bids on various species of dinosaurs captured by the team on the island, including an Ankylosaurus, a juvenile Allosaurus, a Baryonyx, and multiple others. After being captured by Wheatley, Owen attracts the attention of a Stygimoloch, causing her to break through the wall and eventually break through the doors of Owen and Claire's cell allowing them to escape. Meanwhile, in the auction room of Lockwood's estate, Eversol and Mills show the crowd the prototype Indoraptor, emphasizing that the animal is not for sale. Amazed by the creature's ability to lock onto a specific target (courtesy of a laser and an acoustic signal on a gun), the attendees begin to bid on the Indoraptor. Eversol is coaxed by Mills to accept bids, much to Wu's disdain as the prototype Indoraptor lacks Blue's genome - and thus can neither empathize nor follow more specific orders.Owen and Claire encounter Maisie, who has escaped her room and discovered her dead grandfather and the three enter the auction room as the Indoraptor is being displayed. Understanding that the Indoraptor is far too dangerous to be sold, Owen disrupts the auction's proceedings with the aid of the Stygimoloch and wreaks havoc among the spectators, causing Mills and Eversol to end the auction. Owen bests several mercenaries in hand-to-hand combat, then reverses a switch that prevents the Indoraptor's cage from exiting the auction room.Later in the evening, Wheatley enters the deserted auction room and notices the Indoraptor. Having never seen the creature before and wanting one of its teeth for his necklace, Wheatley shoots the Indoraptor with two tranquilizer darts and enters the cage after the Indoraptor appears to be sedated. In reality, the Indoraptor is unaffected by the tranquilizer darts; he smiles and distracts Wheatley by waving his tail in the air before severing Wheatley's right arm and devouring him, his death is witnessed by Eversol who makes a dash for the elevator (without being spotted by the hybrid), where all the other executives were hiding, but pushes a woman out of the way so he can access the code to close the elevator, causing her to scream at the sight of the Indoraptor, who rushes at the still open elevator but the doors successfully close before the Indoraptor can reach them; however, the hybrid (either with intent or by chance) uses its tail to cut off the power supply to the auction room, which automatically reopens the elevator door. The Indoraptor then proceeds to maul Eversol and the other executives to death.Owen reunites with Claire and Maisie and the three encounter Mills and two security guards in the mansion's basement. After unsuccessfully trying to coax Maisie to come with him, Mills angrily and cruelly reveals that Maisie is actually a clone of Lockwood's beloved daughter who had perished in a car accident many years prior. As Owen, Claire, and Maisie process this revelation, the Indoraptor suddenly appears and kills the two security guards, prompting the others to flee.Meanwhile, Zia and Franklin continue to tend to Blue in Wu's laboratory. Zia reveals to Wu that she had given Blue a transfusion of T. Rex blood, infuriating Wu, as it would now be impossible to create an Indoraptor with Blue's pure but now apparently, T. Rex blood-tainted, genome. Franklin injects 20 cc's of Carfentanil into Wu's neck, incapacitating him, before the two are apprehended by a pair of gunmen. Franklin frees Zia from being cuffed to Blue's cage, and Zia frees Blue. As Zia and Franklin flee to safety, Blue kills the two gunmen and escapes the laboratory before a massive explosion occurs - the brief battle had caused damage to several tanks of hydrogen gas within the laboratory.Owen, Claire, and Maisie take refuge on the main floor of Lockwood's mansion, in the skeleton and replica display room. They notice a human corpse on the ground near an Agujaceratops skull; as they approach it, the Indoraptor reveals himself and pulls the corpse farther behind the skull. The three protagonists take refuge against one of the walls of the skull's casing, but the Indoraptor successfully locates their vantage point by tracking their scent and climbing on top of the Agujaceratops skull. The Indoraptor chases Owen, Claire and Maisie up a spiraling staircase before the three escape into a power supply room, where Owen turns off the entire mansion's power.Zia and Franklin discover a hydrogen cyanide leak near the laboratory, which will kill all of the dinosaurs if it spreads to the caging area. Franklin resets the control system in order to restore power to the mansion. At this time, Owen, Claire and Maisie are hiding behind a diorama of a Velociraptor and Dilophosaurus engaged in battle near a glass wall. Maisie soon realizes that she is staring into the face of the Indoraptor through the glass wall and shrieks in terror; the Indoraptor breaks the wall and pursues the group once again, injuring Claire's leg with his toe claw in the process. The Indoraptor chases Maisie up another staircase and down a hallway until Maisie escapes up to her bedroom, where she takes refuge in her bed.Owen is urged to take care of Maisie by the injured Claire; the two share a passionate kiss before Owen leaves to search for Maisie. The Indoraptor, who by this point has ascended to the mansion's roof, lets out a demonic screech and descends the building until he reaches the windows leading to Maisie's room. Hanging upside down, the Indoraptor opens one of the windows and enters Maisie's room, slowly approaching her bed as she begins to shiver and cry. Just before the villainous hybrid attacks, Owen enters Maisie's bedroom and shoots the Indoraptor multiple times with live ammunition. The Indoraptor is unaffected and stands back up to face Owen. Blue enters Maisie's bedroom and confronts the Indoraptor; the two begin a vicious fight as Owen and Maisie escape the bedroom.The Indoraptor fends off Blue and traps Owen and Maisie on the glass roof of the display room. Just before the Indoraptor pounces, Claire appears and coaxes him into attacking Owen with the laser and acoustic signal on the same gun used in the auction demonstration. The Indoraptor charges towards Owen and falls through the glass roof; however, he manages to grab ahold of a rafter connecting the glass panes together and pulls himself back atop the roof. Blue suddenly appears and jumps onto the Indoraptor, causing both to fall down into the display room. The Indoraptor falls directly onto the horns of the Agujaceratops skull, which impales and kills him, while Blue lands on top of the hybrid's corpse and escapes. Franklin and Zia enter and reunite with Owen, Claire, and Maisie, and the five protagonists escape the battleground.However, a new issue looms; the dinosaurs are trapped in a room that is flooded by noxious hydrogen cyanide. Claire releases all of the dinosaurs' cages one by one. Claire puts her hand on the red button that would release all of them from the entire building, but Owen discourages Claire from doing so, thus making Claire resist because she does not want the dinosaurs to destroy the world. However, Maisie pushes the button anyway, releasing the captive dinosaurs, and allowing them to escape to the mainland, exclaiming, ""They're alive, like me.""As Mills is about to put the Indominus Rex fragment into the car, a stampede sound can be heard. As one of the men goes to investigate, a Pteranodon snatches and drops him onto Mills' car, killing him. The now free dinosaurs begin to stampede out of the mansion, trampling another guard to death. Mills immediately takes refuge under the car, which is quickly trampled and destroyed in the stampede. As Mills gets up from underneath his wrecked car and tries to pick up the I. Rex fragment, the T. Rex suddenly appears and snatches him in her jaws, brutally shredding him before tearing him in half with a Carnotaurus, and ultimately devouring Mills, the T. Rex then knocks over the Carnotaurus with her head scaring it off in the process. The T. Rex triumphantly roars and walks away, destroying the I. Rex fragment in the process and ensuring that no carnivorous hybrid can ever wreak havoc upon the world again.
Owen, Claire, Franklin, Zia, and Maisie all exit through the entrance of the Lockwood Manor, where Blue reunites with Owen, and even touches Owen's hand. Owen instructs Blue to accompany him; however, Blue denies him, as she would rather run free on her own than be kept in a cage again.Ian sums up his speech, as a sequence of shots are displayed such as the Mosasaurus attacking surfers, the T.

Aquaman,2018,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1477834/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Arthur Curry, the human-born heir to the underwater kingdom of Atlantis, goes on a quest to prevent a war between the worlds of ocean and land. Born upon the shores of the surface world, Arthur Curry (Jason Momoa) discovers that he is only half human, with the other half of his blood being of Atlanteean descent, thus making him the rightful heir to the throne of the undersea kingdom of Atlantis. However, Arthur learns that Atlantis is being ruled by his malicious half-brother Orm (Patrick Wilson), who seeks to unite the seven underwater kingdoms and wage war upon the surface. With aid from Nuidis Vulko (Willem Dafoe) and the gorgeous Mera (Amber Heard), Arthur must discover the full potential of his true destiny and become Aquaman in order to save Atlantis and the surface from Orm's evil plot.—Blazer346 Arthur Curry (Jason Momoa) has always been different. His mother was an honorable Queen of Atlantean descent, while his father, a simple human lighthouse keeper. They met after she fled to land, running from her forced fiancée. A few years later, Arthur is a toddler, when his mother was forcefully and reluctantly taken back to Atlantis, where she was believed to be executed. Fast forward and Arthur is now an adult. After learning the truth about his destiny, he sets out to find a King's lost trident and stop an entire war before it even starts. Born to the humble lighthouse keeper, Thomas, and the powerful queen of Atlantis, Atlanna, Arthur Curry reluctantly embarks on a dangerous mission to find his roots. But, with his mother nowhere to be found, Arthur, who thinks he has harnessed his unlimited Atlantean abilities, finds himself on a collision course with his spiteful half-brother, King Orm. More and more, conflict is brewing, as Orm is trying to stir up a violent war with the surface dwellers, and crown himself Master of the Ocean after uniting the seven undersea kingdoms. Now, Arthur, along with his ally, the brave Atlantean Princess, Mera, must follow a faint trail of clues to find the Trident of Atlantis, a magic weapon that belonged to its first ruler, Atlan, and avert a devastating final confrontation between the two realms that would mean the death of billions. Will Arthur embrace his destiny and claim his rightful throne?—Nick Riganas A male who was raised and trained on land discovers that he is a prince and the rightful heir of an underwater kingdom. With a war planned to break out between land and water, he must travel to the underwater kingdom to prevent it from happening.—RECB3 The story opens in the small, seaside village of Amnesty Bay, Maine, in 1985. On a very stormy night, lighthouse keeper Thomas Curry (Temeura Morrison) discovers an unconscious woman (Nicole Kidman) washed up on the shore with a wound in her abdomen. He brings her to his home and shelters her. Although she appears frightened and confused when she wakes up, Thomas shows her kindness and tends to her wound. She tells him her name is Atlanna, queen of Atlantis, and the two begin a romantic relationship.Thomas and Atlanna spend the next few years together, and they become parents to a son, Arthur. Everything seems lovely until one day when a team of Atlantean commandos burst into their home and start to attack with the intention of taking Atlanna back to her betrothed, King Orvax. Atlanna fights back and beats the commandos down, leaving her time to get away with Thomas and Arthur. Atlanna tells Thomas she must return to Atlantis for his and Arthur's safety, but she vows to return to both of them someday. She kisses Thomas goodbye and jumps back into the ocean, leaving Arthur her five-tined sea fork for when he is ready to use it.Years later, we see Arthur as a child on a school field trip to the aquarium. He is seen talking to the fish, and two bullies start to taunt and mock him for it. A shark then starts banging on the glass, cracking it slightly and scaring everyone else. They watch in astonishment as all the sea creatures gather right behind Arthur, and his eyes glow yellow as he has them at his command.Twenty years later, a team of pirates led by Jesse Kane (Michael Beach) and his son David (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) take over a Russian submarine. After subduing the men on board, the villains find that they hit something, or rather, something hit them. It's the now adult Arthur (now played by Jason Momoa), better known by many as Aquaman, coming to the rescue. He makes his way into the sub and starts fighting the pirates, laying them all out with ease before going after the Kanes. Jesse fires an RPG at Arthur, thinking he's killed him, but Arthur picks himself up, mostly unscathed. Arthur retaliates by piercing Jesse in the chest. The sub starts to take on water, and Jesse is pinned under a torpedo. David desperately tries to free his father and pleads for Arthur's help, but he refuses to save Jesse because he and his son have killed innocent people. David continues trying to free Jesse, but he knows his time is almost up, and he pulls out a grenade before ordering David to get out and to go kill Arthur. David reluctantly listens and climbs out of the sub as he hears Jesse set off the grenade. Arthur rescues the other Russian crewmen while David escapes in another sub.Arthur joins Thomas as he waits on the docks for Atlanna as he has all these years. The two go to a bar where they see a news report of Aquaman's heroics, and Thomas knows it was his son. He reminds Arthur how he is meant to unite both the surface world and the kingdom of Atlantis. A group of bikers then approach Arthur, seemingly looking for a fight, but they actually just want to take pictures with him.Down in Atlantis, Arthur's half-brother Orm (Patrick Wilson) is with Arthur's mentor Nuidis Vulko (Willem Dafoe) as they prepare to meet with King Nereus of Xebel (Dolph Lundgren). Orm wants Nereus to form an alliance with him in a supposed effort to unite the other kingdoms of the sea. However, Orm's real intent is to build an army large enough to attack the surface world, believing they will strike Atlantis first. Nereus is also aware of Arthur's existence, though Orm refuses to acknowledge his half-brother or that his mother lived among the surface dwellers. Just then, a blast hits the area, an attack by a human submarine. Orm and Nereus round up their forces to strike back, and Orm sends the sub crashing to the lowest depths of the ocean. Nereus is then convinced to side with Orm as they prepare to send a message to the surface.That evening, Arthur and Thomas are leaving the bar when Arthur is found by Princess Mera (Amber Heard), daughter of Nereus. She warns Arthur that Orm is planning to wage war on the surface, and that the lives of people both on land and sea will be in danger. Arthur doesn't seem interested, even as Mera tells him that Vulko has found a path to the long lost Trident of Atlan, which can be used to defeat Orm and allow Arthur to claim his place as king of Atlantis. Arthur remains unmoved, due to his belief that the Atlanteans executed his mother, but he promises to handle Orm his own way if he does attack.Meanwhile in the North Sea, Orm and his commandos meet with David. Orm hands David his payment (in gold coins), but David wants to get his hands on Aquaman whom he blames for the death of his father.A massive tidal wave heads toward the mainland as Arthur and Thomas are driving home. It strikes their truck and forces Arthur out. He frantically swims back to his father, but with Mera's help, they are able to get Thomas out of the water and revive him. Arthur looks upon the now devastated land and is convinced to join her to stop Orm.The two head toward a cliff side to dive into the ocean, the same place where Vulko taught Arthur how to swim, master his Atlantean instincts and fight with his mother's sea fork. Arthur and Mera board her watercraft and ride past Atlantis to a sunken ship where Vulko waits. He tells Arthur that the legend of Atlan's trident is real, as it belonged to the founding king Atlan (Graham McTavish) and was forged from powerful steel, designed to allow someone worthy to rule over Atlantis. Back then, Atlantis prospered on the surface and made impressive technological advancements, but their drive for power ultimately brought their downfall, and Atlantis sunk to the bottom of the ocean. However, their advancements also helped Atlanteans evolve and breathe underwater, while others regressed and mutated into monstrosities. Atlan would spend the rest of his life in exile. Vulko provides Arthur and Mera with a cylinder to find the final resting place of Atlan, just before they are attacked by a commando team. Vulko retreats, Arthur and Mera fight them, but another more powerful group led by Murk (Ludi Lin) arrive and capture Arthur.Arthur is brought before Orm. Taunting Arthur with the belief that his mother was executed for bearing a child from the surface, Arthur suddenly feels he's to blame for his mother's alleged death. Orm also explains his position and hatred for the surface world due to the harm that they have inflicted upon the oceans. He offers to let Arthur leave and never return, but Arthur challenges him to a duel, his right as an Atlantean. Despite objections from Vulko and Mera, Orm accepts.Arthur gears up for the duel, donning a helmet and armor while wielding his mother's sea fork. Meanwhile, Orm gives Mera, his betrothed, a bracelet that he says belonged to Atlanna. A flashback shows Vulko training him to properly use it, even showing him how to create a shield out of a vortex of water. Young Arthur believed that Atlanna abandoned him because she didn't love him or his father, but Vulko told him that she was executed by being fed to the creatures of The Trench.In the present, Arthur heads to the Ring of Fire where the duel commences before an ecstatic crowd of people, most of whom have sided with Orm. Although Arthur puts on a respectable display of force, Orm attempts to drag him down into the lava to kill him. Arthur escapes Orm's clutches, but the evil king uses his trident to destroy Arthur's fork. Mera intervenes and takes Arthur out of the arena before Orm can strike a fatal blow. The two escape in her watercraft and are pursued by Orm's men. Their ship is shot down, but Arthur and Mera escape, although Orm is led to believe that they were killed. The two hide in the mouth of a whale that Arthur summons so that it can take them somewhere safe above the surface.Orm finds out about Arthur and Mera surviving, and he orders his commandos to find them, but Nereus forces Orm to ensure that Mera is brought back safely. Orm then goes to contact David and allows him to lead the commandos to find Arthur and Mera, and he equips David with Atlantean weaponry to ensure that Arthur is killed. David does some personal tweaking to the weapons and suit to his own liking.Arthur and Mera board a plane to take them to the Sahara desert, skydiving from the plane without parachutes. Mera tells Arthur that the Sahara was once covered by the ocean and they walk until they fall down a hole that brings them to an old temple where Atlan's trident was forged. Mera places the cylinder down on a round platform, but nothing happens until she realizes it must be activated with water. She draws water from Arthur and activates a holographic message from Atlan with instructions on how to locate the trident. Arthur then finds an antique wine bottle with a map inside that tells them their next stop is in Sicily.Orm meets with the Fisherman King (Djimon Hounsou) in an attempt to get him to join forces, but the King refuses, and Orm cruelly kills him in front of his wife and daughter. He then orders them to have their people join him.Arthur and Mera arrive in Sicily where they briefly indulge in the activities among the surface dwellers. They find a spot among the statues of past leaders. According to Atlan's message, only a king will reveal the trident's location. Arthur recognizes that the only statue of a king is Romulus, the founder and first ruler of Rome. When placed there, Arthur and Mera are able to use the bottle like a telescope, revealing trident's location, which is in the Trench. They are suddenly attacked by David Kane, now calling himself Black Manta, and his commandos. He fires a laser from his helmet at Arthur, while also using weapons that turn water into plasma blasts. Mera takes on the commandos while Arthur battles Manta. She kills off a few and finishes the rest by manipulating red wine and impaling them with it. Arthur manages to send Manta flying and accidentally blasting himself with his own laser before he falls into the ocean.Mera treats Arthur's wounds and the two sail to the Trench. He tells her how he feels responsible for David becoming his enemy after refusing to save his father, as well as his doubts that he is a worthy leader or king. Mera assures him he is wrong and that he is the bridge between man and the sea.Back in Atlantis, Orm is planning his invasion of the surface with his newly united tribes. He finds out that Vulko was working against him and he orders his men to imprison Vulko.As they sail through a storm, Arthur and Mera are attacked by the hideous creatures of the Trench. They fight back, but a huge horde appears, forcing underwater as the ship is destroyed. Just when it looks like they are doomed, they are pulled out of harm's way by a mysterious being who takes them deep into the trench and up into a tropical chamber with breathable air. To Arthur's surprise, it's Atlanna. He embraces his mother for the first time in years. He also tells her how Thomas has been waiting for her to return after all this time. Atlanna tells Arthur and Mera how she escaped her execution and has been stranded in an uncharted sea. She points out to Arthur that the trident is located behind a nearby waterfall, and only the one true king may enter and come out with the trident. She and Mera give Arthur confidence to head on in.Arthur enters and sees the trident glowing on a dais. He suddenly comes face-to-face with Karathen (voice of Julie Andrews), a gigantic monster that guards the trident. She doubts Arthur's worth and tries to attack him, but Arthur then uses his powers to communicate with her, something that only Atlan was also able to do. When Karathen asks Arthur what makes him worthy of wielding the trident, he says he is not worthy, and that he only wants to save both worlds. Karathen is convinced and allows Arthur to take the trident from Atlan's skeleton, giving him greater power and a new suit of gold and green.Orm, now calling himself Ocean Master, and his forces gather to launch their attack on the surface. A climatic battle begins as Arthur and Mera lead their own forces of sea creatures, including Karathen, to fight back and subdue Orm's army. The creatures take out Orm's men, leading the other Atlanteans to renounce their loyalty to him. Orm then fights Arthur once again, only this time, Arthur forces Orm to the surface. Arthur utilizes the trident's power to his advantage, and he shatters Orm's trident, leaving him on his knees. Arthur decides to spare Orm's life, even as he demands to be killed, but Atlanna rises from the ocean to greet Orm, and the two embrace. Vulko orders the commandos to arrest Orm, and he goes willingly. Arthur tells Orm that he is willing to talk to him when he is ready. The Atlanteans then accept Arthur as their new king.Thomas goes down to the docks once again, and is surprised to see that Atlanna has finally returned to him. The two embrace and kiss.Arthur concludes with a narration stating how destiny has a way of bringing people together the way it brought his parents together. He has now accepted his position as a son of the land, as a king and protector of the seas as... AQUAMAN.Midway through the credits, David is alive, and he is found by Stephen Shin (Randall Park), a conspiracy theorist obsessed with Atlantis and Aquaman. When David wakes up, he finds Stephen checking out the Atlantean tech. David offers to show Stephen how it works if he helps him find and kill Arthur/Aquaman."

The Grinch,2018,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2709692/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A grumpy Grinch plots to ruin Christmas for the village of Whoville. For their eighth fully animated feature, Illumination and Universal Pictures present The Grinch, based on Dr. Seuss' beloved holiday classic. The Grinch tells the story of a cynical grump who goes on a mission to steal Christmas, only to have his heart changed by a young girl's generous holiday spirit. Funny, heartwarming, and visually stunning, it's a universal story about the spirit of Christmas and the indomitable power of optimism. Academy Award nominee Benedict Cumberbatch lends his voice to the infamous Grinch, who lives a solitary life inside a cave on Mt. Crumpet with only his loyal dog, Max, for company. With a cave rigged with inventions and contraptions for his day-to-day needs, the Grinch only sees his neighbors in Whoville when he runs out of food. Each year at Christmas they disrupt his tranquil solitude with their increasingly bigger, brighter, and louder celebrations. When the Whos declare they are going to make Christmas three times bigger this year, the Grinch realizes there is only one way for him to gain some peace and quiet: he must steal Christmas. To do so, he decides to pose as Santa Claus on Christmas Eve, even going so far as to trap a lackadaisical misfit reindeer to pull his sleigh. Meanwhile, down in Whoville, Cindy-Lou Who (Cameron Seely), a young girl overflowing with holiday cheer, plots with her gang of friends to trap Santa Claus as he makes his Christmas Eve rounds so that she can thank him for help for her overworked single mother. As Christmas approaches, however, her good-natured scheme threatens to collide with the Grinch's more nefarious one. Will Cindy-Lou achieve her goal of finally meeting Santa Claus? Will the Grinch succeed in silencing the Whos' holiday cheer once and for all?—Universal Pictures In the town of Whoville, human-like creatures called Whos are filled with excitement about celebrating Christmas. The only one who isn't amused is a cantankerous, green furred creature called The Grinch (Benedict Cumberbatch), who has a heart ""two sizes too small"" and lives in a cave on the top of Mount Crumpit just north of Whoville. The Grinch's only friend is his loyal pet dog Max and they both only visit Whoville when the Grinch needs to buy food and do bad things. Meanwhile, six-year-old Cindy-Lou Who (Cameron Seely) notices that her mother Donna (Rashida Jones) is overworked trying to take care of her and her twin infant brothers, Buster and Bean. She at first decides to send a letter to Santa Claus to help her mother but after encountering the Grinch, who sarcastically says that she'll have to talk to Santa face-to-face about it, she eventually decides to try and trap Santa with the help of her friends. In the town of Whoville, the Whos are eagerly anticipating Christmas. However, just north of Whoville on top of Mount Crumpit, there lives The Grinch (voice of Benedict Cumberbatch), who hates Christmas and the thought of seeing the Whos so joyful. He lives alone with his faithful dog Max. The Grinch gets ready for breakfast, only to discover that he has completely run out of food due to excessive emotional eating. This forces him to make a trip down to Whoville for some groceries. As the narrator (voice of Pharrell Williams) notes, it's not quite known just why The Grinch is the way he is. It could be that his head wasn't screwed on just right, or that his shoes are too tight, but perhaps the biggest reason of all was that his heart was two sizes too small.The Grinch takes Max into town where he acts mean toward the Whos, and then he runs away from a group of carolers. As he gets his food, elsewhere in town, we meet Donna Lou Who (voice of Rashida Jones), an overworked single mother to Cindy Lou (voice of Cameron Seely) and twin boys Buster and Bean. Cindy Lou heads out with a letter to Santa Claus for a big wish she has, but she ends up running into The Grinch. He is mean to her as well, implying that she is, like the rest of the Whos, greedy and demanding for stuff from Santa. After he leaves, she manages to retrieve her letter.On his way back to his cave, The Grinch runs into Bricklebaum (voice of Kenan Thompson), the jolliest Who in Whoville, and a major thorn in The Grinch's side. Bricklebaum puts up his Christmas decorations, which The Grinch calls an eyesore. Bricklebaum explains that the Mayor (Angela Lansbury) wants Christmas in Whoville to be three times bigger this year, which only makes The Grinch feel worse. He returns to his cave and sits alone, feeling that it is better for him this way. Meanwhile, Cindy Lou plans to deliver her letter to Santa personally by walking to the North Pole until Donna tells her that it would take her a month to do so.Later, a gigantic tree is flown into Whoville to be lit that night. Annoyed, The Grinch sets up a catapult to launch a massive snowball to knock the tree down. That night, the Whos gather in the town square as the Mayor is set to light up the three. Cindy Lou gets her friend Groopert (Tristan O'Hare) and tells him that her wish to Santa is that he send help to her mother because Cindy Lou can see just how tired Donna is from all the hours she works and caring for Cindy Lou and her brothers. As the Whos get ready for the lighting, The Grinch prepares his catapult for launch, only for it to roll down the hill and drop the snowball, then launch him toward Whoville. The Grinch inadvertently lights the tree and falls in the middle of the crowd. This triggers a painful memory in him where, as a child, he was always alone, especially around Christmastime, and that's why he hates the holiday so much. He retreats back to Mount Crumpit and hatches a plan with Max to steal Christmas from the Whos.The Grinch's plan involves becoming Santa Claus and following his methods to a T so that he can get in and out of Whoville with ease. He takes Max to find reindeer to pull a sleigh, but when they reach a whole field of reindeer, they are scared away by a screaming goat. The only one left is a fat reindeer that The Grinch later names Fred. After Fred joins The Grinch and Max, The Grinch heads into Whoville to steal a sleigh from the roof of Bricklebaum's house, but not without dealing with his crazy guard dog first. He also uses a flying device to send Max into town to get a sense of how many houses he will hit, only for Max to get distracted by sausages and get sent flying back right into The Grinch.Cindy Lou gathers Groopert, plus her other friends Axl (Ramone Hamilton), Izzy (Scarlett Estevez), and Ozzy (Sam Lavagnino), to discuss her plan to give her wish to Santa, and that is by staging a trap for him. She manages to convince her friends to help set up the trap and test it out with Groopert, but it just tears his Santa suit off and leaves him nude.The Grinch teaches Fred how to pull the sleigh, but just as they are walking out in the field, they spot two other reindeer who turn out to be Fred's mate and child. The Grinch knows what's going on, and, without a fuss, he lets Fred go, lamenting that it's just him and Max again.It is the night of Christmas Eve, and The Grinch tasks Max with pulling the sleigh. They wait until all the Whos are asleep before heading down to make their move. The Grinch hits all the houses using his gadgets, stealing trees, presents, decorations, lights, and food. The very last house he hits is none other than Cindy Lou's house. He sees a cookie and decides to take it, which triggers her trap that she set. Cindy Lou hears the trap going off and she rushes downstairs to meet the man she thinks is Santa. The Grinch manages to fool her and convince her that he is taking her tree to fix a light on it. Cindy Lou then asks him to grant her wish to help her mom, which touches The Grinch since he sees that Cindy Lou isn't selfish like the way he perceives the Whos. The Grinch leaves Whoville with Cindy Lou's words still ringing in his head.As the sun rises on Christmas morning, The Grinch reaches the top of Mount Crumpit to watch as the Whos wake up and see that all of their Christmas things have been stolen. Cindy Lou tells Donna she feels this is her fault because she trapped Santa, but Donna assures her that's not true. Soon, the Whos all join hands and sing ""Welcome Christmas"", which perplexes The Grinch until he closes his eyes and takes in the joy that the Whos have despite all their stuff being gone. It makes The Grinch realize that they find happiness in each other and not their material items. It even makes The Grinch's heart grow bigger. Suddenly, the sleigh starts to slide off the edge of the mountain. The Grinch grabs onto it and tries to hang on using a grappling hook, but that only causes the cliff side to crack. Before The Grinch plummets to certain doom, he is saved by Fred and his family, who are helped by Max to pull The Grinch back up. He then rides the sleigh down the hill to return everything to the Whos. He reveals himself as the one who stole Christmas from them, and he apologizes for what he did before walking back home.Later that day, Cindy Lou visits The Grinch and invites him to go to her house for dinner. Although a bit hesitant, The Grinch brings Max to town where they join Cindy Lou's family and other guests from town, including Bricklebaum. Everyone gathers for dinner, and Donna offers The Grinch the chance to carve the rare Who roast beast. The Grinch gives a small speech in which he admits that he never hated Christmas, but rather the feeling of being alone on the holiday. And so, The Grinch delivers a toast, to kindness and love, the things we need most."

Two years after Solomon Lane's capture, the remains of his organization The Syndicate have reorganized as a rogue terrorist group called the Apostles. IMF agent Ethan Hunt is assigned to buy three stolen plutonium cores in Berlin from ""elements of the Eastern European underworld"". He is joined by Benji Dunn and Luther Stickell for the mission, but the team fails when Stickell is taken hostage and Hunt's attempt to save him allows the Apostles to make off with the plutonium. The team later captures nuclear weapons expert Nils Delbruuk, who designed nuclear devices for an extremist named John Lark, in order to find Lark.. After successfully defeating and dismantling the powerful terrorist cabal, The Syndicate, Ethan Hunt finds himself dealing with the repercussions of his actions; a dangerous new enemy, known only as ""John Lark"", emerges from the darkness, hatching a master plan that pits Ethan and his team back against his old nemesis, Solomon Lane. The film opens with Ethan and Julia getting married by a pastor who turns out to be Solomon Lane. He tells Ethan that Ethan should have killed him when he had the chance. There is a fallout all of a sudden and Ethan wakes up from his dream.
Following the capture of Solomon Lane, the remaining members of 'Syndicate' have become known as 'The Apostles' and Ethan receives a message about one of their members called John Lark set to buy 3 plutonium cores from black arms dealers in Berlin, Germany and how John also had a Russian nuclear weapons specialist captured (Ethan did). At the buy, Ethan poses as John Lark but things don't go well when Luther is taken hostage with Ethan choosing to save Luther and the 3 plutonium cores go missing.
Ethan then interrogates the weapons specialist in the hospital while he is watching a CNN news story of the plutonium cores having caused an attack on Jerusalem, The Vatican and Mecca. The specialist agrees to give Ethan the code to his laptop to track John Lark if John's testimony about there being no peace without first a great suffering being read on CNN. After this occurs, the specialist gives the code with it turning out that the whole CNN news story was faked and no attacks have occurred as of yet. It is revealed that Benji was posing as the news reporter and they were not in a hospital but a facility made to look like one.TITLE SCREEN.Ethan finds out about John set to buy the plutonium cores from a woman called the 'White Widow' at a gala in Paris, France. She runs a charitable organization which in secret deals weapons and nuclear arms. CIA agent August Walker accompanies Ethan to Paris in order to keep an eye on him due to having lost the plutonium cores in Berlin. Using a CIA Cargo plane, they plan to HALO jump into Paris, undetected. On board, they do not get along too well and Walker insists on jumping despite Ethan's warnings about the storm. During their jump out of the plane, Walker - ironically - is struck by lightning but Ethan manages to save his life after providing him with his own oxygen and the 2 successfully manage to land.
At the gala, they find John Lark with the intention of Ethan stealing his face and voice to pose as him for the white widow. Lark ends up fighting back at them in the toilets however where Ilsa unexpectedly shows up and kills Lark by shooting him in the face. With no face to make a mask, Ethan then goes to the white widow pretending to be Lark with Ilsa warning him that if he does, he will die as many operatives are in Paris to kill Lark. Ethan is successful in winning the widow's trust and they manage to escape from the assassins sent to kill Lark with help from Walker and Ilsa.
It turns out that the widow only has 1 plutonium core and that for the other 2 cores, Solomon Lane must be handed to her courier (who is working for The Apostles) in London, England. The only way to do this is extract Lane from a police transfer whom since being captured, has been interrogated and interviewed by many governments around the world. Ethan surmised that all police officers have to be killed in the process, which shocks him inside. However, Ethan agrees to the deal pretending that he has no line (since he is posing as Lark).
During the event itself, Ethan takes the help of the widow's men, including her brother. However, Ethan changes his plan without informing such that no cop has to be killed. Lane's van is pushed into the water and Ethan and Walker drive away while being chased by the police. In the meantime, Benji and Luther extract Lane underwater. Walker and Ethan switch from their truck to motorbikes which they already set up and while Walker manages to get away, due to technical difficulties, Ethan's cover is blown. However, he manages to escape and the team now has Lane under their custody. When they come out into the open, a cop lady finds them in an awkward moment. The widow's men catch up with them and shoot the cop and then point their guns at Ethan for betraying them. Ethan quickly makes a decision and kills those men and saves the cop's life. They proceed to take Lane to the widow in their car when a mysterious person on a motorbike targets them. This turns out to be Ilsa who ends up revealing that she is being forced to kill Lane by British intelligence due to all the secrets he has on them. Ethan has no choice but to evade her so as to keep Lane alive. They manage to find a tracking device planted in Lane and take it out.
Ethan manages to have Lane abducted to await exchange of him to the widow's courier for the 2 cores. Walker provides documents to Salone with a theory on how Ethan might in fact be John Lark based on losing the cores in Berlin as well as pretending to be Lark in Paris as a means to frame him. The team then get ready to have Benji take on Lane's appearance and voice due to not intending to actually hand him over. However Agent Hunley is already waiting for them at their hideout who says the operation is a failure and is a trap. Ethan disagrees and wants to continue on. An argument breaks. It is revealed that there is no courier but that the widow is actually a CIA employee who needs Lane to buy her good will following several bad calls in the past. Walker is then shockingly revealed to be in allegiance to Lane and the real John Lark when he states to a captured Lane how the deal was for him to get all 3 cores in exchange for framing Hunt meaning he already has the 2 cores to begin with. It turns out Walker has confessed this to Benji and not Lane which has also been recorded. Salone, who has been hearing all of this through Hunley's phone says she does not trust anybody anymore and sends her men to get them. However, some of those men turn out to be Walker's men and a gunfight pursues. Ilsa manages to catch up at this point and is also dragged into the fight.
Walker ends up killing IMF director Hanley and escapes along with Lane. However, Luther smartly implanted a tracker on Walker giving Ethan a chance to to pursue Walker. He catches up but Walker reveals that if Ethan does anything, Walker will kill his wife. Walker then escapes in a chopper with Lane.
Based on their tracking device they implanted in Lane (which they did when they took the other one out), the team find out he is headed to Kashmir. Benji also discovers that if 1 core (bomb) was to be disarmed, the other would immediately begin countdown. After eventually arriving in Kashmir, Benji finds out that the only way to disarm the 2 bombs is by removing the key from the remote detonator but only after the countdown on both cores has been initiated. Disarming the 2 cores before the key has been removed will result in the cores going off. They also realize that based on the location of the 2 cores, Walker plans to wipe out the entire water supply of China, Pakistan and India and cause 1/3 of the world's population to starve. They head to a medical facility in Kashmir which is where they track Lane but Ethan instead finds his wife Julia and that she has also remarried.
Luther and Julia manage to find the 1st core and after the 15 Minute countdown begins, they begin to disarm it with Benji and Ilsa going after the location of the 2nd. Two helicopters take off from Kashmir with the detonator being in the possession of Walker. Ethan manages to grab onto the payload of the 2nd helicopter and climb up to the inside where he takes out both the driver and his guard and takes control of the helicopter. A lengthy chase then occurs with Ethan pursuing Walker whom is in the other helicopter. Ilsa manages to find the 2nd core but is knocked out and tied up by Lane whom also takes Benji captive. She manages to break out and knock out Lane as well as save Benji and the 2 of them begin to disarm the 2nd core. Ethan manages to ram Walker's helicopter and also causes the hook on his helicopter to set off steam from his helicopter which disfigures him. The 2 then take part in a fistfight at the edge of a cliff. Walker being naturally beefier than Ethan gains the upper hand. Ethan uses momentum to counter which results in them hanging off the cliff by holding on to the helicopter rope. Ethan manages to have the hook hit Walker in the face where he falls along with the helicopter and dies. Ethan then removes the key from the detonator 1 second before Benji and Ilsa disarm the 2nd core.
Salone arrives there with her men and save Ethan. Lane is once again captured and taken to MI6 and Julia thanks Ethan for giving her the life she currently has based on his willingness to do good."

Michelle Pfeiffer and Laurence Fishburne co-star.—ahmetkozan Two years after Scott Lang was placed on house arrest due to his involvement with the Avengers in violation of the Sokovia Accords,[N 1] Hank Pym and his daughter Hope van Dyne briefly manage to open a tunnel to the quantum realm. They believe Pym's wife Janet van Dyne might be trapped there after shrinking to sub-atomic levels in 1987. When he had previously visited the quantum realm, Lang had unknowingly become quantum entangled with Janet, and now he receives an apparent message from her. With only days left of house arrest, Lang contacts Pym about Janet despite the strained relationship they have due to Lang's actions with the Avengers. Hope and Pym kidnap Lang, leaving a decoy so as not to arouse suspicion from FBI agent Jimmy Woo. Believing the message from Janet to be confirmation that she is alive, the trio work to build a stable tunnel so they can take a vehicle to the quantum realm and retrieve her. They arrange to buy a part needed for the tunnel from black market dealer Sonny Burch, who has realized the potential profit that can be earned from Pym's research and double-crosses them. Donning the Wasp outfit, Hope fights off Burch and his men until she is attacked by a quantum unstable masked woman. Lang tries to help fight off this ""ghost"", but the woman escapes with Pym's lab, which has been shrunk down to the size of a suitcase.. In a flashback to 1987 we see Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) and his wife Janet Van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer) set to go on a mission, leaving their young daughter Hope (Madeleine McGraw) in the care of their housekeeper. As Ant-Man and the Wasp, they shrink themselves to stop a Soviet nuclear missile from detonating inside American territory. Finding that they can't shrink small enough to slip between the steel plates, Janet goes subatomic to drop the missile into the ocean, but it left her lost in the Quantum Realm, and she was presumed dead.However, after Scott Lang (Paul Rudd), as the new Ant-Man, went sub-atomic and managed to return to normal size, Hank tells Hope (now played byEvangeline Lilly) that there might be a way to bring Janet back.In the present day, Scott has been under house arrest after violating the Sokovia Accords by working with Captain America in Stuttgart, Germany. He is spending his day with Cassie (Abby Ryder Fortson), who is visiting him for the day. Scott has a whole area set up with the help of Luis (Michael Peña) in his house for them to play in, including a slide that goes out the door. Unfortunately, Scott's foot breaks through the fence and therefore the perimeter and the FBI pays him a visit. Agent Jimmy Woo (Randall Park) leads the inspection to make sure Scott isn't doing anything suspicious. Scott explains that he's had to get creative to entertain Cassie, including doing sleight-of-hand magic, which impresses Woo. The FBI leaves, and Cassie goes home with Maggie (Judy Greer) and Paxton (Bobby Cannavale).With only three days left under house arrest, Scott does what he can to keep himself occupied. He takes a bath and then has a dream where he finds himself as Janet playing Hide and Seek with a young Hope. Scott later gives Hank a call, despite both he and Hope not having spoken to him since his arrest. He tells Hank about the dream he saw. Hours later, Scott is tranquilized by something flying in the room.Scott wakes up to find Hope driving him somewhere in a shrunken van. She lets him know that she took off his ankle bracelet and put it on the giant ant Scott has living with him. They arrive at the lab where they show Scott that they have created a tunnel to the Quantum Realm in the hopes of bringing Janet back. After Scott describes his dream in full detail, Hank and Hope deduce that he and Janet are connected because of the time he spent in the Quantum Realm. They are missing a key electronic component to get the tunnel to work, so they head to meet with someone who possesses it. Hank shrinks the lab and takes it with him. However, they don't realize they are being watched by a transparent figure.The three arrive at a restaurant where Hope meets with Sonny Burch (Walton Goggins), a black-market tech dealer, while Scott and Hank monitor the situation from inside the van. Burch knows Hope as ""Susan"", but he has already figured out her identity by the time she arrives. Burch refuses to give up the component that Hope needs, so she appears to leave. Burch and his goons start to walk out, but they are knocked around by Hope in her Wasp suit. Scott is impressed to see that she has wings and blasters. She fights them in the restaurant's kitchen and manages to enlarge a salt shaker to knock out one goon while also running across knives being thrown at her.As Hope grabs the component, she is attacked by the figure from earlier, Ghost (Hannah John-Kamen). She is able to phase through anything, which means Hope's punches are useless against her. Scott joins Hope as Ant-Man in a new suit to help her, but Ghost escapes and makes her way to the van and steals the lab from Hank. Scott brings Hope and Hank to hide at X-Con, the security company run by Luis, with Dave (Tip ""Tip 'T.I.' Harris"" Harris) and Kurt (David Dastmalchian) as his employees. There, they try to come up with a plan to get the lab back. Hank figures that he has to reluctantly seek help from a former friend and partner of his, Bill Foster (Laurence Fishburne).Ghost, whose real name is Ava Starr, goes to her home. She phases involuntarily and must sleep inside a special chamber to control it.Scott, Hope, and Hank go in disguise to the university that Bill teaches at. He maintains a grudge with Hank over the work they did together decades earlier (Project Goliath) in which Bill reached 21 feet. Scott then sees Woo and his fellow agents outside, thinking they know he's in there. Before they go, Bill tells them that they can locate the lab by modifying a defractor on one of the suit's regulators. Hank says they can't use the new Ant-Man suit because it's a work-in-progress, so Scott tells them they can find it in the older suit, which is in a trophy that Cassie took to school for show-and-tell.Scott and Hope sneak into Cassie's school, but the regulator on Scott's suit malfunctions, making him the size of a child. They get to Cassie's classroom and get the suit out of the trophy before they are spotted.The trio locate Ava's home and find the lab, but she knocks all three of them out and has them tied up. She reveals she is working with Bill, who took her in as a child. Her father, Elihas Starr (Michael Cerveris), had attempted an experiment to reach the Quantum Realm, but his own tunnel became unstable. His wife Catherine (Riann Steele) tried to escape with young Ava, but the little girl ran back for her father. The tunnel caused a huge explosion, killing Elihas and Catherine, but Ava survived and her molecules destabilized, resulting in her uncontrolled phasing. She and Bill now plan to use Janet's quantum energy to help turn Ava normal, even if it might kill Janet. Hank fakes having a heart attack to get Bill to grab a tin of Altoids for his meds, which really contain Hank's trained ants that grow to a large size and help free them, allowing the three to escape and take the lab back.After enlarging the lab, Janet takes control of Scott's mind, revealing to Hope and Hank a new algorithm that will help them stabilize the tunnel and enter the coordinates to locate her, but she warns them that they only have two hours before the Quantum Realm becomes so unstable they won't be able to reach her for another century.Burch and his goons go to X-Con and interrogate Luis, Dave, and Kurt using a truth serum (though the villains insist that's not what it is). Luis reveals that Scott is with Hope and Hank in the woods where they set up the lab. Ava appears after having heard this information, and she takes out the wheels on Burch's van as she heads to find the heroes herself. Burch then contacts the crooked FBI Agent Stoltz (Sean Kleier) and tells him where Scott will be. Stoltz tells Woo, and Luis quickly warns Scott so that he can return home before he is caught escaping his house arrest. Cassie is with him and says he could use a partner to help him, meaning herself, but Scott says he has Hope, which Cassie thinks is also a good fit.Hope and Hank are caught by FBI agents once they shrink the lab. Stoltz grabs it but he is knocked out by Ava, who then takes the lab herself. Scott uses the trained ants to help Hope and Hank break out of the FBI headquarters. The ants guide the three to the lab's location, and Luis joins them as backup. Hank uses the giant ants to get Bill out so that he can use his old suit to go into the Quantum Realm and find Janet. The lab is shrunken again, and Luis grabs it. Scott, as Ant-Man, is attacked by Ava, but he holds her off long enough for Hope and Luis to get away. Scott flies away on a flying ant to meet up with Hope and Luis at the rendezvous point, but they are followed by Burch and his men, as well as Ava. Hope shrinks and enlarges the van to literally throw the goons off, even enlarging a Hello Kitty Pez dispenser to throw at one of them. Scott grows to Giant Man to stop them, but as Ava intervenes, Hope becomes The Wasp to fight her. Burch takes the lab and runs to the docks where he boards a ship to get away. Scott grows again to reach him and stop him to recover the lab. Luis shows up in another car to meet with them, but Scott gets light-headed from being so huge that he falls into the water. Hope swims down to save him.In the Quantum Realm, Hank nearly loses his signal, but he finally manages to locate Janet at her coordinates, and they tearfully reunite with a kiss. Meanwhile, the lab has returned to its normal size, and Ava and Bill are planning to extract Janet's quantum energy. Hank and Janet start to return as Ava and Bill begin the process, which starts to drain Janet. Scott and Hope show up and disable their machine, giving Hank and Janet enough time to come out of the Quantum Realm. Hope reunites with her mother at last.Janet then sees Ava's condition, and she puts her hands on Ava to stabilize her and stop her phasing. Everyone leaves as the heroes take the lab. Bill wants to keep protecting Ava, but she tells him they need to split up. Outside the lab, Dave and Kurt help Luis incapacitate Burch and his goons before injecting them with truth serum as the cops arrive, leading to their arrest. Burch and his goons admit to everything.Woo thinks he knows Scott is out on the streets as Ant-Man, but he goes to his home and finds Scott there. Scott's sentence is finally over, and he is a free man once more. The first thing he does is go see Cassie.In the final scene, Luis gets a new, wealthy client for his business to keep them from going under. Hank brings Janet to the beach where they set up a new house that he expands to it's original size. Scott shrinks himself, Hope, and Cassie in a car so they can use a laptop as a screen like a drive-in movie. They are then bothered by a large butterfly.Mid-Credits Scene: Hank and Janet have set up the Quantum Tunnel in a van on a rooftop with Hope's help so that Scott can enter it. He obtains quantum energy to keep helping Ava be stabilized. Just as Scott is ready to be brought back he hears a radio static and doesn't hear anyone on the other end. Back in the real world: Hank, Janet, and Hope have all been turned to dust by Thanos snapping his fingers (at the end of 'Avengers: Infinity War'), leaving Scott forever trapped in the Quantum Realm with no chance of getting back to Earth.Post-Credits Scene: Most of San Francisco appears to have felt the effects of the Gauntlet: more than half of all life in the city, on Earth and the entire universe is gone... except for the giant ant, who is still in Scott's apartment playing on his drum-set.The final text reads ""Ant-Man and the Wasp will return...?"""
Bohemian Rhapsody,2018,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1727824/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The story of the legendary British rock bandQueenand lead singerFreddie Mercury, leading up to their famous performance atLive Aid (1985). Bohemian Rhapsody is a foot-stomping celebration of Queen, their music and their extraordinary lead singer Freddie Mercury. Freddie defied stereotypes and shattered convention to become one of the most beloved entertainers on the planet. The film traces the meteoric rise of the band through their iconic songs and revolutionary sound. They reach unparalleled success, but in an unexpected turn Freddie, surrounded by darker influences, shuns Queen in pursuit of his solo career. Having suffered greatly without the collaboration of Queen, Freddie manages to reunite with his bandmates just in time for Live Aid. While bravely facing a recent AIDS diagnosis, Freddie leads the band in one of the greatest performances in the history of rock music. Queen cements a legacy that continues to inspire outsiders, dreamers and music lovers to this day.—Twentieth Century Fox Bohemian Rhapsody is a movie based on the true story of Queen's journey from the start of the rock band to their now-legendary 1985 performance at the Live Aid concert in Wembley Stadium. The story chronicles lead singer Freddie Mercury's tempestuous journey from an outcast immigrant struggling to find his place in a rejecting society to his becoming a beloved and world-famous artist. In 1970s London, a poor baggage handler at Heathrow Airport--the talented and fiercely ambitious Indian Parsi refugee, Farrokh Bulsara--sees a golden opportunity when the lead singer of the local band, Smile, decides to quit. With an incredible vocal range and a new name, the humble Zanzibar boy becomesFreddie Mercury, and along with guitaristBrian May, drummerRoger Taylor, and bassistJohn Deacon, they form the hugely successful British rock band,Queen. However, against the backdrop of fame, bad decisions, and a fateful AIDS diagnosis, the Queen will have to stomach a reunion, just in the nick of time for an extraordinary twenty-minute appearance at London's Wembley Stadium, in the 1985Live Aid (1985)concert.—Nick Riganas Bohemian Rhapsody conjoins four major worlds concerning the rise of British rock band Queen during the nineteen seventies and eighties; we see a glimpse into their world of tours and the making of their 1975 album ""A Night at the Opera"", dealings within the music business and their respective loves and hates and highs and lows, the life of its charismatic leadman Freddie Mercury, his lovers' and challenge with the AIDS HIV virus and their performance at London's Wembley Stadium at the 1985 world televised broadcast Live Aid concert.—Cinema_Fan The film opens with preparations being made for the historic Live Aid concert in 1985. As the stage is set, running to the front is the legendary rock star, Freddie Mercury (Rami Malek).In a flashback to 1970, Freddie is seen working as a baggage handler at London's Heathrow Airport. He lives with his parents Jer (Meneka Das) and Bomi (Ace Bhatti), and sister Kashmira (Priya Blackburn), and lives as Farrokh Bulsara, but he prefers to be called Freddie.Freddie attends a show at a club to see a band called 'Smile' perform. After the show, members Brian May (Gwilym Lee) and Roger Taylor (Ben Hardy) are told by their front man Tim Staffell (Jack Roth) tells them that he wants out of the band to pursue bigger opportunities. As he looks for the band, Freddie meets Mary Austin (Lucy Boynton) and compliments her scarf, which she says is from the store she works at. Freddie then approaches Brian and Roger after the show to compliment their performance and offer to be their new singer. They seem unconvinced at first, especially with Freddie's large teeth, but Freddie sings for a moment to show off what he can do.Freddie joins Brian and Roger, along with their new bassist John Deacon, or ""Deaky"" (Joseph Mazzello). Someone in the audience comments on Tim's absence and replacement with a ""paki"". After a bit of an awkward start, Freddie shows off his talent, despite singing some of the lyrics a bit incorrectly.A year later, the band is getting steady work performing gigs across England, and Freddie has been dating Mary. After their van breaks down, Freddie proposes that they sell it to record their first album, and they start to go by the band name 'Queen'.Mary and the guys have lunch at Freddie's home, joined by Mary's deaf father. Jer tells the guests how their family were originally from Zanzibar until they were chased out of there. Freddie then answers the phone and tells the guys that a music manager named John Reid (Aiden Gillen), who works with Elton John, has listened to their demo and wants to meet and manage Queen, to the excitement of the other guys.The band meets with Reid, who introduces them to Paul Prenter (Allen Leech), another manager. Reid gets the band to go on a popular BBC show to perform ""Killer Queen"", but they initially clash with the show's producers for wanting them to perform the way the network wants them to (mainly lip-syncing the song).1975At home, Freddie proposes to Mary, who accepts. The other guys come in to tell Freddie that Reid has booked the band a tour of America. The band embarks on their U.S. tour to ecstatic sold-out concerts. They also hire lawyer Jim Beach (Tom Hollander), or ""Miami"" as Freddie prefers. The band, plus Reid and Beach, meet with EMI's record producer Ray Foster (Mike Myers) to make their next album. Freddie proposes something similar to an experience of going to the opera, and so he wants to call it ""A Night at the Opera.""The band stays together as they work toward their next big hit. While trying to write new songs, Paul approaches Freddie and kisses him. Although he doesn't try to resist, Freddie tries to make it seem like he doesn't feel somewhat similarly toward Paul, who claims he knows Freddie as well as he knows himself.Despite some disagreements, the band comes to create ""Bohemian Rhapsody"". They play it for Foster, who thinks it's too long at six minutes and is comprised of nonsense words. He would rather use Roger's ""I'm in Love With My Car"" or ""You're My Best Friend"" to be the main single on the album over ""Bohemian Rhapsody"", since he thinks those songs would play better with a young demographic while no radio station will want to play a long song. Queen decide to turn their backs on Foster and EMI. Freddie takes ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" to DJ Kenny Everett (Dickie Beau) to play it for the very first time to the public. It receives mixed to outright scathing reviews, but it becomes one of the band's biggest hits that they play at venues all over the world.After the world tour, Freddie meets with Mary, whom he had been distancing himself from on the road. He comes out to Mary as bisexual, but she tells him she thinks he's gay. She starts to cry as she is tired of all of Freddie's excuses, and she breaks up with him.1980Freddie cuts his hair short and sports his now famous mustache. He owns his own home next to Mary, but he appears to be lonely. He calls Paul to arrange a party and invite a bunch of strangers. Freddie invites the band, but he starts to behave all crass and rudely toward them, prompting them to leave. After the party, Freddie gropes a waiter, Jim Hutton (Aaron McCusker). Although he offends Jim, Freddie apologizes and invites him to stay. The two chat and share a kiss before Jim leaves, but he invites Freddie to find him after he's found himself.Brian comes up with a new song that he thinks will encourage the audience to perform along with the band - ""We Will Rock You"". Sure enough, it becomes another smash hit. After one of Queen's performances, Paul approaches Reid and suggests that they try and get Freddie to go solo. Meanwhile, Freddie finds Mary with her new boyfriend David (Max Bennett). On the way home from the show, Reid offers the solo deal to Freddie, but it only enrages him to even think about leaving the band, and Freddie fires Reid.Freddie's behavior gets worse as he shows up to rehearsals late and almost fights with Roger. However, for all that rancor, the band remains productive: they settle their arguments as Deaky creates a catchy new bass line that inspires a new hit, ""Another One Bites The Dust"".The band goes to a press conference where reporters hound Freddie with questions about his sex life and orientation, due to ongoing rumors that he has been engaging in gay orgies. He appears too overwhelmed and dazed to properly answer questions when he is not being rude to the reporters.Queen then does a video for ""I Want To Break Free"", which gets banned by MTV for featuring the group in drag. Later, Freddie tries to get in touch with Jim, but finds that there are a large number of Jim Huttons in the phone book.Freddie later confesses to the others that he signed a $4 million solo contract with CBS Records, which deeply upsets the others. As Freddie leaves, Brian tells Freddie that he needs them more than he realizes.1984Freddie moves to Munich, West Germany to record his solo album, ""Mr. Bad Guy"". One night, he is visited by Mary, who says she is pregnant. She tries to convince Freddie to rejoin the band as they have been offered a spot to perform at the Live Aid benefit concert for Africa. Mary leaves, but Freddie confronts Paul about not telling him about Live Aid. He breaks up with Paul and demands that he never see him again. In retaliation, Paul goes on TV to discuss his sexual relations with Freddie.Freddie gets in touch with Beach and manages to get the others together to discuss joining Live Aid. He apologizes to the guys for his behavior and abandoning them. Beach tells them that the lineup is fully booked, but he talks to Bob Geldof and convinces him to let them perform, and they all agree under the condition that anything they come up with be credited to Queen as a whole and not to any individual one of them.The band starts to practice for the show, but Freddie falls ill. He sees a doctor and gets the diagnosis that he tested positive for AIDS. Freddie tells the band about it, but he doesn't want them to feel bad for him as long as they can continue to perform together as friends. They all then get together for a group hug.1985The day of Live Aid has arrived. Freddie finds Jim and invites him to come see the show. He visits his family and shows them love before heading to the performance. Bomi decides he will want to watch the show on TV with his family. While at the show, Mary and David arrive, and Jim joins them backstage to watch the show.It is now Queen's turn to perform. They start with ""Bohemian Rhapsody"", where Freddie blows a kiss to the camera for his family. The next song is ""Radio Ga Ga"", followed by ""Hammer To Fall"", and finally ""We Are The Champions"", where people watching everywhere sing along to. Numerous calls for pledges come in, bringing in over £1 million, and Queen's performance is so epic that it drives many viewers to tears. After the performance, the guys walk away like true champions.The final text states that Freddie Mercury died in 1991 from AIDS-related pneumonia at age 45. He was in a relationship with Jim Hutton for the rest of his life, and he remained good friends with Mary Austin until his death. Jim Beach and the surviving members of Queen joined to create the Mercury Phoenix Trust to help fight AIDS worldwide."

Before he crossed paths with The Rebellion, Han Solo was a former Imperial Militant who became a space pirate cruising around the Outer Rim alongside his fellow outlaw: the mighty Wookiee, Chewbacca. This is the story of how he came to be known as the galaxy's most notorious smuggler, and how the man became a legend.—Johnny In the vast and tumultuous galaxy of ""Star Wars,"" a young and ambitious Han Solo finds himself on a path to becoming the iconic smuggler fans have come to know and love. The film takes us on a journey through Han's early years, where ambition, charm, and a touch of recklessness define his character. The story begins on the industrial planet of Corellia, where Han dreams of becoming a pilot and escaping his life of hardship. Alongside his love interest, Qi'ra, he makes a daring escape attempt, setting in motion a series of events that will shape his destiny. Through twists of fate, Han meets Chewbacca, the Wookiee who becomes his loyal co-pilot, and Lando Calrissian, the suave gambler with a flair for the dramatic. Together, they become involved in a high-stakes heist for a criminal syndicate, led by the enigmatic Tobias Beckett. The mission takes them across various landscapes, from the perilous spice mines of Kessel to the sophisticated world of Dryden Vos, the crime lord. Along the way, alliances are tested, friendships are forged, and Han's character is molded. The film delves into themes of identity, freedom, and the moral ambiguity of a galaxy ruled by power and greed. It's a coming-of-age tale that explores Han's transformation from a hopeful dreamer to the cynical but charismatic rogue.—Evan Almindo In this second 'Star Wars' stand-alone, spin-off film, it opens with the traditional ""A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away.....""Across the known galaxy during the early years of the First Galactic Empire, organized crime syndicates are running rampant due to rampant lawlessness on the mid and outer rim worlds since the fall of the Galactic Republic, forcing others to fight for survival. On the industrial ship-building planet Corellia, Lady Proxima (voice of Linda Hunt), leader of the White Worms gang, is after a hyperfuel known as coaxium. Meanwhile, one young man seeks a way out of Corellia for good.That man is Han (Alden Ehrenreich). After getting his hands on some coaxium, he meets with his girlfriend Qi'ra (Emilia Clarke) as they plan to escape. They are found by some of Proxima's minions and are taken to her, where she demands the coaxium. Han takes out a rock that he pretends is a thermal detonator and throws it at the walls to bring in sunlight, which Proxima and her species are allergic to. Han and Qi'ra run and evade the worms as they chase after them, managing to lose them after Han gets them through a tight spot in the wall with a stolen speeder, but they end up stuck and have to continue running on foot.At the nearby spaceport, Han and Qi'ra evade Imperial storm trooper guards and bring the coaxium to a female Imperial officer as a bribe to help them escape. They nearly make it to freedom until they are spotted by the worms again. Han is able to make it out, but Qi'ra is captured. Separated by a security gate, Han promises to find a way to get her out. Now on his own, Han decides to enlist as a pilot for the Empire. He speaks to a recruitment officer, and he asks Han his full name. When he can't give him a surname, and when the officer sees he is alone and has no family, he dubs him Han ""Solo"".The story jumps ahead three years...Han is fighting on the muddy, foggy planet Mimban as an Imperial infantryman -- he has since been kicked out of the Imperial Flight Academy for insubordination. Most of the fighters on his side are killed, but Han manages to find three thieves posing as fighters - Tobias Beckett (Woody Harrelson), his girlfriend Val (Thandie Newton), and the alien Rio Durant (voice of Jon Favreau). Fed up with constant conflicts, Han wants to join them after telling them he's a good pilot, but Beckett refuses to let him join, even after Han threatens to blackmail them. Beckett sets Han up to be arrested, lying to some Imperial officers. Han is taken by guards and thrown into a pit to be fed to a beast. The beast turns out to be the Wookie Chewbacca (Joonas Suotamo). He attacks Han, but when Han reveals he can speak the Wookie language, they decide to work together to break out. Han uses Chewie to break the beam that's keeping them bound together, collapsing the ceiling and spilling the two guards that threw Han into the pit down to the floor. The two escape and see Beckett, Val, and Rio leaving on a ship, hoping to have caught a ride. Rio manages to convince Beckett to bring the two on-board since the immensely strong Chewie could work well as extra muscle.The crew rests for the night on the snow-covered planet Vandor before their upcoming job. As they sit around a campfire, Val figures that Han has joined them for a girl. Beckett tells Han that they are trying to steal a large amount of coaxium from a train for the people they work for. Beckett disassembles a DL-44 blaster rifle he's brought with him, stripping it down into a pistol that he gives to Han.The next day, the crew spots the train and they go in for the heist. They find the coaxium, but they are attacked by a gang of Cloud Riders. The crew fights them off, but Rio is shot as he flies the ship overhead, forcing Han to pilot the ship. Rio then succumbs to his wounds. Val is at the end of the tracks just over a cliff where the Cloud Riders ambush her. To ensure they don't get the others or the coaxium, she blows herself up with the tracks, causing the train to plummet to the ground. Han also ends up dropping the coaxium, realizing that the craft isn't powerful enough to yank it away from the Cloud Riders. The coaxium explodes, collapsing a big portion of the mountain.Beckett leaves memorials for Rio and Val, and he punches Han in the face for ruining the mission. They were supposed to deliver the coaxium to a criminal named Dryden Vos (Paul Bettany), leader of the Crimson Dawn syndicate. Without the coaxium, Beckett fears Dryden will kill him. Han offers himself and Chewie to help Beckett find another stash of coaxium and reach a new deal with Dryden. Beckett reluctantly agrees to let Han and Chewie come along.The three travel to Dryden's huge, luxurious ship docked nearby. While attending a lavish party, Han spots Qi'ra, who has been working for Dryden for the last couple of years. After the ruthless Dryden kills the regional governor in his private room, he steps outside to speak to Beckett and meet Han and Chewie. After discussing what happened with the coaxium, Han suggests that they steal unprocessed coaxium from the mines on the planet Kessel. Dryden has Qi'ra join them. The danger is that unprocessed coaxium is highly unstable and must be taken to a refining facility quickly before it explodes.In order to get a ship to travel to Kessel, Qi'ra brings the three to meet the charming smuggler Lando Calrissian (Donald Glover) as he is playing a card game of Sabaac against other alien pilots. Han challenges Lando to a game, where the winner gets the other's ship. Han appears to poised to win, until Lando cheats, using a card hidden in his sleeve to outmatch him. Still, Lando joins Han and the others on their mission for the potential profits that would follow. They stop to get Lando's droid friend, L3-37 (voice of Phoebe Waller-Bridge), who is watching a fight between other droids and is upset to see that they are used like gladiatorial slaves. Lando brings them to his ship, the Millennium Falcon, and they take off for the mining planet of Kessel.The team arrives on Kessel and heads toward the mines, having to navigate the large, stormy cloud that surrounds the planet. L3 initiates a riot by freeing captive droids, which allows the others to find the coaxium and take it. At the same time, Chewie spots imprisoned Wookiees, and Han allows him to go and free them. An all-out battle begins as the team tries to escape, only to be shot at by the creatures. L3 is blasted, and Lando runs in to save her, losing her lower half, and he is wounded trying to take her back to the Falcon. The team gets the coaxium on-board and they fly away, where L3 dies in Lando's arms. As the team flies out, they are found by an Imperial star destroyer blockade that sends out TIE fighters to attack. With Lando injured, Han must pilot the Falcon to evade the TIE fighters and make it through the Maw, a cluster of black holes. They are attacked by an enormous space monster that tries to devour them. Han must then do a ""Kessel Run"", but Lando points out nobody can do it in less than 20 parsecs. Using a piece of L3's machinery to navigate the ship, they find themselves being sucked toward a black hole, which the space monster falls victim to as it is ripped apart. Han then has Beckett use a small dose of coaxium to boost the Falcon out of danger. It works and they fly out, and Han is able to brag that he made the Kessel Run in 12 parsecs.The team is set to meet with Dryden on the planet Savareen, where they plan to process the coaxium at a disused refinery. The group are soon found by the Cloud Riders. Han tries to bluff them, saying he has a small unit of soldiers waiting aboard the Falcon. The ruse fails when Lando flies off in the Falcon. Beckett believes the Riders are a bunch of marauders, until their leader, a teenage girl named Enfys Nest (Erin Kellyman), reveals herself and says they only want to keep the coaxium out of Crimson Dawn's hands. A resistance is building in opposition to the Galactic Empire and Nest wants the coaxium to use in the fight.Han, Qi'ra, and Chewie bring the coaxium to Dryden who's ship lands nearby. When he sees a sample, he says that it is fake. It turns out Beckett was his inside man, and he told Dryden that Han had been planning to sell the coaxium to the Cloud Riders. However, Han reveals he took a page out of Beckett's book and anticipated that Beckett would betray them. The coaxium in the room is real, and the Cloud Riders have nothing. Beckett takes Chewie hostage, along with the coaxium. Dryden fights Han and Qi'ra, ending with Qi'ra overpowering Dryden and stabbing him through the heart with his own blade. Qi'ra tells Han to go after the coaxium and to save Chewie, and she will join them soon.Han catches up to Beckett. Beckett attempts to talk his way out of the situation and draws his gun, but Han shoots first and kills Beckett. Meanwhile, Qi'ra contacts her true boss... a shadowy figure who reveals himself to be Darth Maul (Ray Park). She tells him of the mission's failure, and he assigns her to Dryden's former position. She leaves on Dryden's ship, passing over Han and Chewie. She looks over to him, and he looks back.Han gives the coaxium to Enfys and her team. She offers him a chance to join them, but he declines. Enfys leaves Han and Chewie with a vial of coaxium for themselves.Han finds Lando and challenges him to another game of Sabaac, only this time, he manages to swipe Lando's cheat card from him before the match. Han wins fairly, and he gets the Falcon. Along with Chewie, they decide to head to Tatooine after Beckett had mentioned a gangster (Jabba The Hutt) putting together a crew for another mission. Han then puts the Falcon into hyperspace as they take off."

Six months later he is brought back to the foundation by one of their leading scientists but in his visit, Eddie comes across an alien known as a Symbiote. Venom, the Symbiote, choses to attach and adapt to Eddie's body however this gets Brock in trouble by Carlton Drake (Riz Ahmed), the leader of the Life Foundation. Eddie/Venom must stop Drake from continuing with his plans of turning the humans en masse into full Symbiotes with his invasion forces. Defeated, and having no one to turn to after choosing to go after the nefarious Life Foundation Corporation and its visionary CEO Carlton Drake, the former idealist reporter Eddie Brock is with his back to the wall. Then, six challenging months later, down-and-out Eddie unearths Drake's shocking secret about his unethical experimentation on humans, only to unwittingly become the host for a mysterious, amorphous, pitch-black alien life-form: the powerful interplanetary Symbiote, Venom. Now, whether he likes it or not, Eddie must keep the voracious parasitic organism alive, as Earth is about to fall prey to megalomaniac Drake's destructive master-plan. But can Eddie survive the poison within?—Nick Riganas The film opens as a space shuttle from the Life Foundation crash-lands in East Malaysia. Medics arrive on the scene and recover one survivor, astronaut J.J. Jameson III (Chris O'Hara). Jameson is brought into an ambulance where something that has latched onto him has come alive and attacks those inside the vehicle, causing it to flip and crash. An EMT (Michelle Lee) steps out of the wreckage, now playing host to the alien entity known as the symbiote.In San Francisco, we are introduced to reporter Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy), who lives with his fiance, a lawyer named Anne Weying (Michelle Williams), who is set to represent the Life Foundation and its CEO, Carlton Drake (Riz Ahmed). Eddie is well-known for his TV news show, ""The Eddie Brock Report"", where he undergoes investigative stories to share with others. When he gets to work, Eddie's boss (Ron Cephas Jones) sends him to interview Drake, but he asks Eddie to not press Drake with any questions about his work. Anne asks the same since she knows Eddie can be hotheaded, which is what got him driven out of New York.Eddie finds an email on Anne's computer with information regarding three confirmed deaths resulting from the shuttle crash. Against his orders, Eddie goes to interview Drake about his space travel program, but then goes off-script and starts to ask Drake about the deaths and how he is responsible for them. Drake cuts the interview short, and Eddie's boss fires him. Anne also gets fired, and she breaks up with Eddie.Back in Malaysia, the EMT wanders into a local market and starts to eat an eel. The vendor chastises her for it, so the symbiote forms a blade around her arm, and she slits the vendor's throat. Nearby onlookers try to attack her in retribution, but the symbiote releases quills that kills everyone around her. The EMT then walks to an elderly woman (Vickie Eng), and the symbiote releases the EMT (who is now dead) and latches onto the old woman.Six months later.Drake is continuing his research into symbiotes by having tests run on homeless people. He speaks to one subject named Isaac (Jared Bankens) to make it seem like he is taking on some kind of groundbreaking task for mankind. Drake releases a symbiote into the room with Isaac and lets the entity overtake his body. He seems fine for a while until he begins convulsing, and the symbiote leaves Isaac's now dead body, having devoured his organs.In San Francisco, Eddie is now jobless and alone, living in a small seedy apartment. He goes to a nearby shop where he is acquainted with the clerk, Mrs. Chen (Peggy Lu), but Eddie sees that she is constantly getting robbed of her money by a thug (Sam Medina), and he is unable to do anything about it. Eddie is then approached by Dr. Dora Skirth (Jenny Slate), a scientist from the Life Foundation who is appalled by Drake's experiments on humans. She wants Eddie's help in exposing Drake, but he refuses to go along because he doesn't care about what happens to mankind anymore.Eddie goes to Anne's apartment to visit her, only to find her coming back from a date with her new boyfriend, Dr. Dan Lewis (Reid Scott). Once they are alone, Eddie admits to Anne that he misses her and that he blames Drake for what happened to him, but Anne tells him that it's his own fault that he has hit rock bottom. Eddie later calls Skirth to join in on her mission.Skirth brings Eddie to the Life Foundation's headquarters and sneaks him in. Eddie takes pictures of the gruesome displays of the symbiote's victims. He recognizes one of the living ones as Maria (Melora Walters), a homeless woman that Eddie is friendly with. He tries to break her out of her cell, only for Maria to attack him. The symbiote in her body then latches itself onto Eddie, and he runs out. Security guards chase Eddie, and he now appears to have enhanced strength and agility, allowing him to escape.Drake and his people find Maria's body and know that there is a symbiote specimen on the loose. Drake gets Skirth to admit that Eddie was involved, and he leaves her inside a cell to be killed by another symbiote. Drake then sends a team of mercenaries led by Roland Treece (Scott Haze) to go after Eddie.Eddie starts to experience bizarre symptoms. He has an appetite for weird food choices (among them are frozen tater tots and rotten meat) and he feels like he has a fever. He also starts to hear a low, growling voice speaking to him. He finds Anne and Dan on a date where he shows off how messed up he is while also going through other peoples' food, and then sitting in a lobster tank to eat live lobsters. Anne and Dan figure they have to help Eddie.Dan does an MRI test on Eddie, but the frequency from the test causes a painful distortion in Eddie's head.Back home, Eddie is once again in pain when his neighbor plays his music too loud. Eddie goes to tell him to turn it down and is scoffed at until the symbiote mutates Eddie's face into a monstrous form, and the neighbor promptly agrees. Moments later, Treece and his goons break into Eddie's home to capture him. Eddie tries to surrender, but the symbiote has other plans. As the mercs attack, Eddie finds himself fighting them off involuntarily with the help of the symbiote. Treece records this to show off to Drake, who is amazed that Eddie is a fitting match for the symbiote. Eddie then flees his apartment as more mercs start to show up. Eddie is chased through the city as he finds a motorcycle to ride. The symbiote helps him take out the goons and also maneuver through the streets with ease, until Treece slams into Eddie with his car. As he approaches Eddie, the symbiote overtakes Eddie's whole body, transforming him into VENOM. Before Venom can kill Treece, another merc shoots at him. Venom bites his head off and then retreats.Eddie finds himself near a lighthouse where his bones are miraculously healed. Venom (what the symbiote calls itself... himself?) speaks to Eddie and says he is a great host, though Eddie is mortified at seeing a man's head get bitten off. Venom tells Eddie that if he wants to survive, he need only comply.As Venom, Eddie climbs to the top of his former workplace to deliver evidence of Drake's crimes to his old boss. He nearly falls off the roof when a plane passes overhead and its frequency disrupts the symbiote, but Venom manages to catch Eddie before he hits the ground. After leaving the evidence, Eddie tries to leave, only for the mercs to try and get him once more. Venom fights them off before retreating.Eddie and Anne find each other after she goes by his apartment and sees that it's a crime scene, and she brings him to Dan's office for more help. She knows something is wrong with Eddie. Venom tells Eddie to talk to Anne, as Venom has taken a liking to her. Eddie apologizes for his screw-ups, though Anne tells him it's not the time.Dan runs another test on Eddie and determines that the symbiote is a parasite (which Venom does NOT like to be called). After Dan tells Eddie that he and the symbiote are essentially draining each other of life, Anne turns on a high frequency that causes the symbiote to pull off of Eddie's body. Venom escapes through the vents after Eddie leaves, and he latches himself onto a small dog. Treece and his men then finally get Eddie and bring him to Drake.Meanwhile, the elderly woman from earlier goes to an airport and finds a small girl to use as a new symbiote host. The girl makes her way to San Francisco and finds Drake, and the symbiote then takes over Drake's body.Drake interrogates Eddie over the whereabouts of the symbiote. The symbiote in Drake forms around his body, naming itself Riot. Eddie learns that Drake's plan is to head back into space and find more symbiotes to bring back to Earth for them to use humans as hosts.Anne finds the dog that is hosting Venom, and she then heads to the Life Foundation as she now hosts Venom (making her She-Venom). Anne helps break Eddie free and also bites off Treece's head (which horrifies her), and she transfers Venom back to Eddie through a kiss.Eddie and Venom head off the find Drake and Riot before they board the rocket. The two men fight using their symbiote forms, while Anne turns on a frequency to disrupt both of them and make the symbiotes leave their hosts. Drake sees Riot and tries to reattach himself, but Eddie kicks him off the ledge. Eddie turns around and is impaled by Riot, who then boards the rocket as it starts to lift off. Venom finds Eddie and latches back onto him, healing the impalement wound. They then leap onto the rocket as Venom cuts open the fuel line, causing the rocket to explode and incinerate Drake and Riot. The flames from the rocket also cause Venom to seemingly ""die"" as Eddie falls into the water.Sometime later, Eddie and Anne appear to have mended their relationship as friends. He mentions being asked to bring his show back and do a show on Drake, but he has other plans to meet with someone in prison. It also turns out that Venom is still inside Eddie, though he keeps that a secret from Anne. Eddie walks away and bumps into an old man (Stan Lee), who encourages him to not stop fighting for what he loves. Venom also wants to eat the man's dog.Eddie walks around with Venom and tries to explain to him that if they are going to stick together, that he cannot just eat any person he wants, and that they may only target the really bad people. He goes into Mrs. Chen's shop, and the thug from earlier attempts to accost her for money again. Eddie morphs into Venom and devours the thug in front of Mrs. Chen. Eddie asks Venom what they should do next, and he responds that they can do whatever they want.Mid-Credits: Eddie goes to San Quentin Prison for an interview with his newest subject, a serial killer by the name of Cletus Kasady (Woody Harrelson).

The next day, Ralph attempts to fulfill her desires by creating a secret bonus track during a race. Vanellope overrides player control to test it out, but the resulting conflict between her and the player results with the cabinet's steering wheel being broken. Since the company that made Sugar Rush is defunct, one of the kids finds a replacement for Mr. Litwak on eBay. Litwak finds it too expensive and has no choice but to unplug Sugar Rush, leaving the game's characters homeless.. After saving the arcade from the Cy-Bugs invasion and from Turbo's revenge, six years have passed when Wreck-It Ralph and Vanellope von Schweetz are still best friends who hang out every night after work in Litwak's Family Fun Center and Arcade. However, six years of being a racer in Sugar Rush has caused Vanellope to express quandaries with the increasing predictability of her game, so Ralph tries to surprise Vanellope with a new hidden track in Sugar Rush. Vanellope enjoys the track but goes against the controls of the player to ride it, causing the wheel on the console to get stuck, and the player to accidentally remove the wheel from the game. Mr. Litwak inadvertently breaks the wheel while trying to reattach it. Knowing that the company who made the part went out of business years ago, Litwak has no choice but to unplug Sugar Rush, rendering Vanellope and its citizens homeless.After a conversation with Fix-It Felix Jr. in Tapper's, Ralph decides to venture with Vanellope via the newly installed Wifi router to the Internet to find and purchase a new wheel for Sugar Rush from eBay.

After engaging in a high-speed chase throughout Slaughter Race, the car's owner Shank commends Vanellope for her racing skills, causing visible jealously in Ralph at the budding friendship. Despite not allowing the pair to take her car, Shank points the duo towards video sharing site BuzzzTube after posting a video of Ralph taking a leaf blower to the face. They meet up with an algorithm named Yesss who gives Ralph the funds earned from his videos' popularity. When the money earned turns out to not be enough to keep Vanellope from returning to Slaughter Race to consult Shank, Ralph decides to make more videos playing off the top trends to earn more money.Ralph becomes a viral sensation with Yesss playing off this by having her assistants venture out into the internet and spamming users with pop up ads.

Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,2018,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4633694/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Teen Miles Morales becomes the Spider-Man of his universe and must join with five spider-powered individuals from other dimensions to stop a threat for all realities. Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, the creative minds behind The Lego Movie and 21 Jump Street, bring their unique talents to a fresh vision of a different Spider-Man Universe, with a groundbreaking visual style that's the first of its kind. ""Spider-Man(TM): Into the Spider-Verse"" introduces Brooklyn teen Miles Morales (Shameik Moore), and the limitless possibilities of the Spider-Verse, where more than one can wear the mask.—Sony Pictures Miles Morales has just started at a new school and is struggling to fit in. Then he is bitten by a radioactive spider and he obtains certain powers, similar to those of Spiderman. He doesn't know what to do with the powers, or how to control them, so naturally he turns to Spider-Man for advice.—grantss Struggling to find his place in the world while juggling school and family, Miles Morales, a smart teenager from Brooklyn, reluctantly enrols in an elite New York City boarding school. Wrestling with his new responsibilities, Miles discovers a whole new world hidden at an abandoned NYC subway tunnel, only to get bitten by a stealthy radioactive arachnid from another dimension. Now, gifted with unfathomable powers, much like the originalSpider-Man (2002), Miles is shocked to discover that life has become even more complicated, unbeknownst to him that he is about to get caught in the middle of a dreadful inter-dimensional conflict. More and more, with the fate of the multiverse hanging by a thread, young and utterly inexperienced Miles has no other choice but to master his newfound abilities, even though he believes that not everyone is cut out to be a hero. But a hero isn't the one who always wins. It's the one who always tries. Can Miles take a leap of faith and become Spider-Man?—Nick Riganas This animated film starts with Peter Parker (voice ofChris Pine) introducing himself as we know him, the friendly neighborhood Spider-Man. By now, everybody knows how big he is, what with saving New York constantly, getting his own comics, cereal, and even a Christmas album. He does have some things he's not proud of (the emo dance, for one), but he takes his duties as Spidey proudly, as he is the one and only.We meet Brooklyn teen Miles Morales (voice ofShameik Moore) as he is getting ready to start attending a private school. He lives with his father Jefferson (voice ofBrian Tyree Henry) and his mother Rio (voice ofLuna Lauren Velez). Miles goes around his neighborhood greeting his friends and tagging street signs with stickers he made. Jefferson, a cop, catches Miles and escorts him to school in his cruiser. As they ride to the school, they see a news report on Spider-Man, whom Jeff is not a fan of. Once they arrive, Jeff tells Miles he loves him, but Miles fails to say it back. Jeff then uses his radio to force Miles in front of all the other students to say ""I love you"" back, embarrassing him.Miles gets into his schoolwork as he tries to adjust to this new environment. During one of his classes, he meets Gwen Stacy (voice ofHailee Steinfeld), who doesn't immediately tell him who she is. Later, Miles sneaks out of his dorm to visit his Uncle Aaron (voice ofMahershala Ali), who is Jefferson's brother and a sort of black sheep due to his criminal activities. Miles tells him about Gwen, and Aaron tells him to do a shoulder touch to try and charm her. The two then go to the tunnels near the subway so that they can do some graffiti since Aaron is fond of Miles's artwork. As Miles spray-paints the walls, a radioactive glitching spider crawls up his leg and bites his hand after Miles takes a picture of his work, but he only lightly taps the spider off his hand before leaving with Aaron.The next day, Miles finds himself feeling differently. He hears a voice in his head (which is accompanied by comics-style text boxes), his clothes barely fit, and he is sweating profusely. He runs into Gwen, who tries to make up a fake name when they properly introduce themselves. Miles tries to do the shoulder touch, but he only gets his hand stuck on Gwen's shoulder, and then her hair, leading them to have to go to the nurse for her to cut her hair off. When Miles tries going back to his room, he is found by a security guard who calls him out for leaving his dorm. Miles runs and hides in the man's office, getting everything stuck to him as he keeps freaking out. He climbs out the window and finds himself walking on the walls before running into the streets, amazed by his newfound powers and abilities.Miles later goes to the tunnel where the spider bit him. As he examines it, it starts glitching again. Not long after, Miles hides as his spider-sense detects danger. Spider-Man enters as he's being pursued by the Green Goblin (voice ofJorma Taccone). The fight takes them beneath Fisk Industries where Wilson Fisk/Kingpin (voice ofLiev Schreiber) is attempting to start up a Super Collider. In the middle of Spidey fighting Goblin, he takes the time to get Miles out of harm's way. Spidey realizes Miles is just like him, just as the machine is turned on. Outside in the city, certain structures start to get weirdly morphed into other shapes. A blast occurs in the tunnel. Spidey is badly injured, and Miles tries to help him, but Spidey tells him to hide before giving him a drive to shut down the Collider. Kingpin, Goblin, and another villain, The Prowler, gather around Spidey and remove his mask. He begs Kingpin not to restart the Collider, even telling him to think about his family, but this angers Kingpin and he kills Spider-Man by slamming his fists down onto him, which Miles watches in horror. He runs back home where his parents find him, and he runs to hug Jefferson.The news breaks out that Spider-Man is dead, and that he was Peter Parker. New Yorkers everywhere are devastated. Miles buys a costume (the store owner is the voice ofStan Lee, no less) before attending a memorial service for Peter, with many other fans attending dressed as the wall-crawler. Mary Jane (voice ofZoë Kravitz) delivers a eulogy for her husband while Aunt May (voice ofLily Tomlin) stands solemnly in the back.Miles is inspired by MJ's words to take up the mantle of Spider-Man. He wants to test out his powers, but he isn't quite sure of how to get them to work. He later pays a visit to Peter's grave, just as he is spotted by another man...Peter B. Parker (Jake Johnson). In his own words, this Peter tells us that in his universe, he's been Spider-Man for years and is now an adult, but he's lost Aunt May and he was married to Mary Jane but is now divorced due to him not being able to work out his issues as Spidey, as well as him not wanting kids when she did. He became depressed and gained weight, and then the Collider turned on, which pulled him into this dimension. Now after finding Miles, he gets knocked unconscious, leading Miles to try and swing away with him as the police go after them, only to end up crashing on the streets as people walk past them.Miles brings Peter somewhere for safety. He questions Peter as to how it's possible that he's there alive when he correctly guesses the alternate dimension theory. Miles takes out the drive that the Peter of his universe gave him (which other Peter calls a ""goober""), but it's broken. Peter frees himself and takes the broken goober to try and find a new one so that he can get back home, as being in this dimension causes him to glitch and be unstable. However, before Peter can head off on his own, Miles guilts him into letting him join so that they can make things right together.Miles and Peter, dressed in their costumes, go to Alchemax Labs where the data on the Collider is being kept. As they try to find a way to sneak in, Kingpin and his henchman Tombstone (Marvin Jones III) and his top scientist (voice ofKathryn Hahn). Kingpin's motive for operating the Collider is to be reunited with his wife Vanessa (voice ofLake Bell) and son Richard. Years earlier, they watched as he tried to kill Spider-Man, and they fled from him, only to be tragically hit by a truck.Miles and Peter manage to sneak into the lab and find the room with the computer. Miles starts freaking out again as he can't unstick himself from the ceiling, just as Kingpin and his scientist are outside. Miles then also finds out he can turn invisible while he's scared. The scientist then enters the room, forcing Peter to try and charm her. She is impressed to find Spider-Man alive, but only so she can kill him herself. She then reveals her name to be Dr. Olivia Octavius, aka DOC OCK. She reveals her mechanical tentacles as she attacks Peter, but Miles grabs the computer so that they can go. They are chased by scientists out of the lab and into the woods. The guys swing through the trees as the villains catch up, but Doc Ock gets webbed up by a third spider-person...GWEN. She tells Miles and Peter how she too has come from another dimension where she was bitten by a spider. There, she saved her father's life but couldn't save Peter. The three of them then head out of the woods to get away. Doc Ock later goes back to Kingpin, who is highly displeased to find there are two more Spider-Men around.Miles, Peter, and Gwen to go Aunt May's home, where she is able to figure out that the Peter she sees before her is from another dimension. She takes them to her Peter's old secret hideout, which is full of different suits, gadgets, and vehicles. There, the three meet Spider-Man Noir (voice ofNicolas Cage), a black-and-white old-gangster-talking hero; Peni Parker (voice ofKimiko Glenn) and her robot SP//dr, which is powered by a radioactive spider; and Peter Porker, aka Spider-Ham (voice ofJohn Mulaney), who was actually a spider bitten by a radioactive pig. All of them were pulled from their own dimensions and into Miles's world. They each plan to stay behind and shut down the Collider with a new goober so that the rest can get home, but Miles says it has to be him since this is his dimension. When Peter tries to back him up by stating the cool powers that Miles has, he is unable to turn them on and prove to the others that he is capable of helping. Miles turns invisible and he dejectedly leaves the cave.Miles goes to Aaron's home for help, just as Jefferson and Rio are contacting Aaron since they haven't heard from Miles in a while. Miles finds Aaron's apartment empty, but then encounters Prowler inside, prompting him to go invisible again. Prowler speaks to Kingpin and removes his mask, revealing himself to be Aaron. Miles is horrified. He tries to get out of the apartment but is chased by Aaron throughout the city until he manages to evade him.Back at Aunt May's house, Miles reunites with the other Spider-People to tell them that his uncle is working for Kingpin. Unfortunately, Miles has led Prowler there, along with Doc Ock, Goblin, Tombstone, and Scorpion (voice ofJoaquín Cosio). The villains attack, and the Spider-People spring into action. Even Aunt May gets in on it by defending her home. Prowler goes after Miles and chases him to the rooftop. Kingpin orders Prowler to finish Miles off, until Miles takes off his mask to reveal himself to his uncle. Aaron is mortified that he almost killed his nephew. As he backs down, Kingpin shoots Aaron in the back and then goes for Miles, but he swings out of there with his uncle. He takes Aaron to an alley where he is dying. Miles blames himself for what happened, but Aaron encourages him to keep pushing forward. Jefferson finds Miles over Aaron's body, sending Miles fleeing. Jeff then sees his brother and breaks down.Miles returns to his dorm where the other Spider-People meet up with him. They cause his roommate to pass out from seeing them crawl up the wall. Peter webs Miles up to his chair and takes the goober to go stop the Collider, telling Miles it's for his safety. After they leave, Jeff comes up to Miles's dorm outside, but he can't respond thanks to the web. Jeff tells him about Aaron and only wishes for Miles to be okay. Miles then musters up the strength to bring out his power to free himself.Miles goes back to Aunt May's and gets the original Spider-Man suit, which he spray paints with dark colors. He then tests his powers more confidently as he swings around the city.The other Spider-People find Kingpin's gala where they are able to sneak in because the staff are wearing Spidey masks. Peter sees MJ and tried to express his guilt toward leaving her, even though she doesn't know it's him or what he's talking about. They proceed down to where the Collider is, but Kingpin's henchmen find them and proceed to attack. Miles swings in and joins his comrades as they fight back. To make things worse, the Collider is activated, causing another earthquake across the city as dimensions start warping together.Spider-Man Noir takes on Tombstone while Peni and SP//dr fight Goblin, and Spider-Ham beats up Scorpion with a cartoon mallet. Doc Ock goes after Gwen and Peter while Miles tries to shut the Collider down. The henchmen are taken out, and Doc Ock is plowed by an inter-dimensional truck. Unfortunately, SP//dr is heavily damaged, leaving Peni devastated as Noir and Spider-Ham comfort her. She takes the spider back as they prepare to jump back home. They say their farewells, and Peni goes first, followed by Noir and Spider-Ham. Gwen affirms her friendship with Miles before going home. Peter tried to stay back and help Peter, but Miles chooses to send Peter back so that he can fix what he has to do in his world. Miles then goes after the Collider, but Kingpin starts hitting back hard. He then starts to see a new Vanessa and Richard as their dimensions start crossing over. Just as Kingpin seems to overpower Miles, he sees Jefferson as he enters the area. Miles gets himself up and uses his power to blast Kingpin away and then send him webbed up toward the button to shut down the Collider for good.Outside, Miles calls Jeff to let him know he's okay. He then approaches him as Spider-Man and hugs him, letting him know he's doing a good job, but not letting his dad know who he really is. Jeff then finds Kingpin webbed up and prepped for arrest.Miles now assumes his regular school duties while also taking on his role as the new Spider-Man, earning a number of new fans across the city. Meanwhile, in Peter's dimension, he heads off to patch things up with MJ. As Miles settles in his room for a nap, a dimensional portal opens and he hears Gwen's voice calling to him.There is a dedication forStan LeeandSteve Ditko.After the closing credits, there is a scene where Miguel O'Hara/Spider-Man 2099 (voice ofOscar Isaac) learns about the other Spider-People from his assistant Lyla (voice ofGreta Lee). He travels to Earth 67 where he ends up in a weird pointing argument with the Spider-Man from the 1960s cartoon."
A Quiet Place,2018,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6644200/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A family struggles for survival in a world where most humans have been killed by blind but noise-sensitive creatures. They are forced to communicate in sign language to keep the creatures at bay. In a devastated Earth overrun by invincible predators of a possible extraterrestrial origin, the Abbotts are struggling to survive in the desolate urban jungle of New York City: a death trap defined by a new era of utter silence. Indeed, as noise attracts this new type of invader, even the slightest of sounds can be deadly. However, even though it's already been twelve months since the powerful monsters' first sightings, the resilient Abbott family still stands strong. In this muted dystopia, learning the rules of survival is crucial. And now, more than ever, the Abbotts must not make a sound.—Nick Riganas The story of the young Abbott family is told starting on day eighty-nine of their ordeal. Unaware if anyone else on Earth is still alive besides them, they have to remain as silent as possible under most circumstances, which means no speaking, to evade deadly and seemingly indestructible armored creatures which track their targets solely by sound and which have led to the Abbotts' solitary existence. This existence is made all the more difficult for eldest offspring Regan in being deaf and thus unable to gauge the issue of sound, which is why father, Lee, is constantly trying to devise ways to upgrade her cochlear implant if only for her survival. Under these circumstances, the family tries as best it can to lead as normal a life as possible with devised safeguards to protect them despite anything that may happen to them potentially to throw them off this routine of mock normalcy and survival. Through this ordeal, they also try to learn as much as they can about the creatures in the hope of someday being able to destroy them to regain their lives. For parents Lee and Evelyn, the first priority is protecting the children at all cost, which the children may not always see or understand especially concerning the day eighty-nine incident.—Huggo Day 89Amid the many, tattered missing persons fliers; a family quietly tiptoes barefoot through an empty store of a ghost town. The family's mother, Evelyn Abbott (Emily Blunt), carefully looks through a cluster of uncollected prescription bottles for her eldest son, Marcus (Noah Jupe), who is sick. Evelyn gives Marcus some medication and uses sign language to reassure her Deaf daughter, Regan (Millicent Simmonds), that her brother is okay. Regan then checks on her younger brother, Beau (Cade Woodward), who is drawing a picture of a rocket on the floor. He signs to Regan, ""Rocket. That's how we'll get away."", then climbs the mostly empty shelves and reaches for a space shuttle toy. The toy falls from the shelf, but Regan scrambles to catch it before it hits the floor. Meanwhile, the family's father, Lee Abbott (John Krasinski), has scavenged some electronics for a radio which will boost its signal as well as some cutting pliers for Regan. Evelyn signs to her family that ""It'll be dark soon"" and they prepare to leave when looks of horror come across their faces. Beau has the electronic space shuttle toy in his hands which Lee carefully takes from him removing its 2 AA batteries. He signs to his youngest son, ""It's too loud."" As the family departs, Regan sneaks the toy back to Beau who then grabs the batteries on his way out. The Abbotts silently walk back home on a trail of sand they've created. As they come to a walking bridge, they suddenly hear the electronic sound of the space shuttle toy from Beau who is pulling up the rear. A horrified Lee races back toward his son, but it's too late, an alien creature quickly seizes and kills Beau.Day 472The Abbotts are home on their family farm. Lee is in the basement of the farm house where he has set up an extensive surveillance system of cameras and monitors as well as his radio and electronics which he uses in the hope of contacting any other survivors. There are also scores of various news clippings which report of an alien invasion, as well as notes from Lee that read, ""blind"", ""attack sound"", and ""armour"". Evelyn, meanwhile, is in a cellar where she hangs a mobile she has crafted. Evelyn is pregnant. She sets up an oxygen tank which is connected to an infant breathing mask. It sits next to a covered, sound-proof baby crib. Lee has moved up to the top of his grain silo where he looks through pictures of Beau.Evelyn asks Regan to tell her father that dinner is ready, which she reluctantly does. After silent prayer, they eat quiet foods on leaves of lettuce instead of plates. Afterwards, Regan and Marcus play Monopoly when he accidentally knocks over a lantern which sets the rug on fire. Lee quickly puts it out, and they quietly wait for the consequences. It seems as though they've dodged a bullet but then hear a loud noise on the roof. Lee looks out the window and is startled, but relieved, to see a raccoon fall from the roof. He heads down into the basement to work on a cochlear implant processor which will help his daughter hear. Evelyn comes down where they share a smile and a set of ear buds as they slow dance to Neil Young's Harvest Moon.Day 473While Lee is pouring down more sand on their walking paths, Evelyn is in the cellar checking her blood pressure. Her due date is just a couple weeks away. She places a stethoscope to her abdomen revealing a strong, healthy heartbeat. Regan enters the house being careful to walk only on the marked parts of the floor which don't creek and wants to go down into the basement, but her dad stops her. He has added small amplifiers from a stereo to her new cochlear implant processor and wants to put them on Regan, but she stops him and signs that they never work. Lee, disheartened, hands them to her instead and starts to set out on an excursion. He wants Marcus to come with him, but the boy is scared and doesn't want to go. Instead, it's Regan who wants to go, but Lee tells her to stay and take care of her mom. She runs to her room and tries on the new cochlear implant processor. When they don't work, she's devastated. Regan packs a bag which includes her cutting pliers and a wrapped object from her dresser, then leaves the farm.Lee has taken his son to the river where he teaches him that making small sounds is okay as long as louder sounds are nearby. Next to a waterfall they can speak freely to each other w/out fear of being heard. Marcus asks his dad why he didn't let Regan come and if he blames her for what happened to Beau, because she blames herself. When Lee says it was no one's fault, Marcus tells him if he still loves her, he should tell her. During this conversation, Regan has arrived at the walking bridge where a makeshift memorial has been constructed for Beau. She unwraps the object from her dresser which we discover is the space shuttle toy, then uses the pliers to cut a wire which enables the toy to light up w/out making any noise. Back at home, Evelyn is carrying a laundry bag up from the basement when it gets snagged on the stairs. She manages to pull it loose causing her to fall and exposing the point of a nail sticking up from the stair.On the way back home, Lee and Marcus are startled by an old man coming out of the woods, and then notice the dead body of his wife on the ground nearby. Lee implores the old man to stay silent, but instead he lets out a primal scream. Lee grabs Marcus and runs as the man is quickly scooped up and killed by an alien. Back home, Evelyn's water breaks. She heads down to the basement and impales her foot on the exposed nail coming up from the stair. She manages not to scream out, but drops the picture frames she was holding which draws an alien into the house. Evelyn pulls her foot off the nail, switches on the red light-bulbs which run across the property and serve as a warning signal, and searches the shelves for a mechanical kitchen timer. The alien slowly walks down the stairs into the basement listening for any evidence of life. When the timer goes off, the alien attacks it as Evelyn runs upstairs. She sees another alien in the front yard. Evelyn goes upstairs into the bathroom and sinks into the tub. She's starting to give birth as the alien comes upstairs.Lee has returned home and is horrified to see that the red lights have been switched on. He signs the word ""rocket"" to his son. Then tells him, ""I need you to make a sound louder. You can do it."" Lee grabs his shotgun as Marcus sprints to a designated area and lights a fuse which sets off a series of fireworks. Lee searches the house and walks into the bathroom where he sees an empty bathtub covered in his wife's blood. He starts to weep believing Evelyn is dead, then discovers that she is safe and hiding in the shower w/ their new baby boy. Marcus, meanwhile, is walking back toward the house when he hears an alien. He makes a run for it into the cornfield, but runs straight into a tractor wheel, knocking himself unconscious.Regan has returned home and notices the beam of Marcus' flashlight coming out from the cornfield, but cannot hear the alien coming up behind her. But as the alien moves closer, Regan's cochlear implant processor starts producing a high-pitched feedback which distresses the alien causing it to run off. Regan finds Marcus and they retreat to the top of the grain silo. Lee has taken Evelyn to the cellar and placed his new son into the sound-proof crib. Evelyn thinks about Beau and regrets that she didn't carry him on that fateful day, then, before getting some much needed sleep, makes Lee promise that he will protect their children. Lee leaves to look for the kids as we see water rushing down into the cellar. Later, Evelyn wakes to find that the cellar has flooded. On top of this, an alien has climbed down inside the room, and the baby is sleeping in the sound-proof crib but the top is open. Evelyn carefully picks up her baby and slinks to the back of the cellar behind the waterfall flooding the room.On top of the silo, Marcus signs, ""Don't worry, he'll come for us."" but Regan shakes her head replying, ""He'll come for you."" All of a sudden a hatch on the top of the silo breaks causing Marcus to fall inside of it. As he's slowly drowning in the grain, the alien in the cellar w/ Evelyn is drawn out by the noise. The hatch breaks away completely and falls into the silo just missing Marcus. Regan, herself, jumps into the silo and successfully saves her brother by pushing the hatch towards him so he can grab hold of it. However, she herself quickly sinks into the grain. Marcus climbs onto the hatch and pulls out his sister to safety. Regan and Marcus both sit safely atop the silo door, but then they hear a crash on top of the silo. The alien from the flooded cellar jumps in the silo as the kids cover themselves with the hatch door. They seem doomed until Regan's cochlear implant processor once again lets out a piercing feedback forcing the alien to crash out the side of the silo.Regan and Marcus crawl out of the silo and into a pickup truck. Lee has arrived on the scene and grabs an ax, but is quickly attacked by the alien which causes Marcus to scream. Upon hearing this, the alien heads for the truck and starts ripping it open. This time when Regan's processor starts its piercing feedback, she turns it off. Now the alien can safely resume its attack on the truck. Lee, who is badly injured, makes eye contact with his daughter and signs, ""I love you. I have always loved you."" He then lets out a yell to sacrifice himself and save the kids. They put the truck into neutral and roll it back to the house where they reunite with their mother.Evelyn and the kids hear the alien approaching, so they retreat back into the house and head down to the basement. Regan, who was never allowed down there, sees (for the first time) the evidence of all the work her father put into repairing and creating her cochlear implant processor. She is overwhelmed with emotion just as the lights begin to flicker. The alien walks down into the basement and has them cornered. Regan, however, scans a handwritten scribbling from her dad which read, ""What is their weakness?"", then takes a quick glance at the hearing aids on his workbench. And Eureka! She switches on her cochlear implant processor creating feedback, and causing the alien to shudder. Regan then amplifies the feedback by holding the processor up against a microphone. The alien collapses then slowly staggers back up on its feet, but Evelyn has grabbed Lee's shotgun and blows its head to pieces. When they see on the surveillance monitors that this little brouhaha has seemingly brought every alien in the county to their home, Regan turns up the speakers while Evelyn pumps the shotgun wearing a wry grin on her face.Written by:

Rachel Chu, an American-born Chinese NYU professor, travels with her boyfriend, Nick to his hometown in Singapore for his best friend's wedding. Before long, his secret is out: Nick's family is wealthy, and he's considered the most eligible bachelor in Asia. Every single woman is incredibly jealous of Rachel and wants to bring her down.—JAP Native New Yorker Rachel Chu goes with her boyfriend, Nick Young, to his best friend's wedding in Singapore. Excited about visiting Asia for the first time but nervous about meeting Nick's family, Rachel's unprepared to learn that Nick has neglected to mention a few key details about himself.—Warner Bros. Chinese-American New Yorker Rachel Chu (Constance Wu) travels to Singapore with her boyfriend Nick Young (Henry Golding) to attend his best friend's wedding and discovers that he comes from one of Asia's most wealthy, prominent families. A commoner among the social elite, Rachel becomes a target for single women vying for Nick's attention, as well as for his judgmental mother Eleanor (Michelle Yeoh), who wants nothing more than to break them up. Directed by Jon M. Chu. Based on the novel of the same name by Kevin Kwan. After dating for a year and becoming serious, Rachel Chu, an Economics Professor specializing in game theory at NYU, and her boyfriend Nick Young, who have a modest existence as per their income, are traveling to Singapore for the wedding of Nick's best friend Colin and his fiancée Araminta. The trip will be the first time Rachel will meet Nick's Asia-residing friends and family; he grew up in Singapore and has only spoken of his family in general terms. As she gets closer and closer to meeting Nick's family, Rachel slowly realizes that he comes from an extremely wealthy background. He has never mentioned anything about this and his life in New York has never shown any indication that his family is old-money and one of the most powerful families in Singapore. Rachel finds that her time in Singapore is like a fishbowl, especially on the speculation of who Nick, the most sought-after of Singapore bachelors, would marry. She also finds that many people in Nick's Singaporean circle are against her being in his life; at the top of this list is his mother Eleanor; she blames Rachel not only for Nick not returning home a year earlier like he had planned, but also that Rachel might not be appropriate support to Nick's heir-apparent role as head of the Young Corporation. With some of Nick's friends and family on her side, specifically his cousin Astrid who married outside of their class for love, and her main support in Singapore being her new-money college friend Peik Lin Goh, Rachel must decide whether the situation with NIck's family is worth fighting, or if the price for Nick is too high for her to be in his life in the long term.—Huggo London, England 1995Eleanor Young (Michelle Yeoh) arrives at the Calthorpe Hotel with her son Nick (Nevan Koit), sister Felicity (Janice Koh), and niece Astrid (Amanda Evans). When asking at the front desk for her reservation, the clerk and the manager, Reginald Ornsby (Daniel Jenkins) lie about not having her reservation for obviously racist reasons. Eleanor calls her husband, who then calls Lord Calthorpe (Peter Carroll), who is good friends with the Young family. Calthorpe tells Ornsby that he has sold the hotel to the Youngs, leaving him looking foolish. Eleanor's first act as owner is to order Ornsby and the clerk to wipe the mud that Nick left on the floor.New York City, 2018Rachel Chu (Constance Wu) is giving her economics class a lesson by having her play poker with a student, whom she beats, to the impression of the others. Afterwards, Rachel joins Nick (now played by Henry Golding), her boyfriend, for a meal. Nick tells Rachel he wants to take her to his hometown in Singapore for the wedding of his best friend Colin Khoo (Chris Pang), which would be a great opportunity for Nick to introduce Rachel to his family. In the corner, two women from a blog site called Radio1Asia spot Rachel and Nick, and one of them snaps a picture of the two of them as she walks past them. This spreads at the speed of light in the Asian community until it makes its way to Eleanor, who is with her sisters, and they start discussing Rachel. She calls Nick to ask about bringing his mysterious girlfriend with him for the wedding.Rachel is with her mom Kerry (Tan Kheng Hua), and they discuss the fact that Nick has never really talked about his family. Rachel thinks they may be poor and that he's ashamed of that.Rachel and Nick go to the airport, where, to her surprise, they are placed in first class. Nick then reveals that his family is very wealthy and that the flight is one of their perks. He then tells Rachel about his cousins with whom he shares the fortune. Alistair Cheng (Remy Hii) is a big shot filmmaker/producer based in Taiwan who is dating his lead actress, Kitty Pong (Fiona Xie), though she is noted as being a terrible actress. Then there is Alistair's brother Eddie (Ronny Chieng), a banker who is married to Fiona (Victoria Loke) with three children, though he is obsessed with their image and is seen criticizing Fiona's dress choice because it's only good for Chinese Vogue and not American Vogue. Finally there is Astrid (now played by Gemma Chan), whom Nick describes as being a sweetheart. She is seen speaking to a little girl and complimenting her teddy bear before meeting with a jeweler to purchase earrings worth over $1 million.The couple arrives in Singapore where they are picked up by Colin and his fiancee Araminta Lee (Sonoya Mizuno). They go around the city and indulge in local food that Rachel hasn't tried.In Astrid's home, she is reading a bedtime story to her son Cassian (Joe Ong) before her husband Michael (Pierre Png) comes in. He married into the wealthy lifestyle, though Astrid tends to hide some of her expensive shoes and jewelry so as to not seem.The next morning, Rachel goes to visit her old college roommate Peik Lin Goh (Awkwafina), whose family is also very wealthy, but more ""new money"" than Nick's family. Rachel meets Peik Lin's parents, Wye Mun (Ken Jeong) and Neena (Koh Chieng Mun), and her three siblings. When Rachel mentions that she's dating Nick Young, everyone drops what they're doing and informs Rachel just how rich the Youngs are, as they are the biggest real estate developers in the area, as well as other parts of the world. Rachel tells Peik Lin of a party the Youngs are throwing that evening at Nick's grandmother's home, and Peik Lin takes out some fresh clothes for Rachel to wear.Rachel and Peik Lin arrive at the glamorous estate, and Nick invites Peik Lin to stay and enjoy the party. Nick brings Rachel around to meet some of his relatives, including his cousins and aunts, before taking her to meet Eleanor, and then his ah ma (grandmother), Shang Su Yi (Lisa Lu). Almost instantly, the family looks down upon Rachel for not coming from money like the rest of them. Rachel tells Eleanor how her mother is a single self-made woman working in real estate and how she is an economics professor, and that her father died before she was born. Eleanor frowns upon this, viewing ambitions as being unnecessary. Elsewhere in the party, Astrid is with Michael before he leaves the room. She looks at his phone and reads a text from another woman saying ""The bed feels empty without you.""The next day, Rachel joins Araminta and her friends for her bachelorette party while Nick joins his cousins and their gaudy rich schoolmate Bernard Tai (Jimmy O. Yang) for Colin's bachelor party. The bachelor party takes place on a freight ship, which has pools and a dance floor. Eddie criticizes Nick for choosing Rachel, seeing her as merely a commoner, and noting to Colin that his own family wouldn't have accepted Araminta were she not from a wealthy family herself. Nick and Colin leave the party and head to a spot to relax themselves, where Nick reveals an engagement ring that he plans to use to propose to Rachel. Colin notes that Nick already stunned his family by not returning the year earlier to inherit their company, and to marry Rachel would mean to walk away from his inheritance.Meanwhile, the ladies are on an island where Araminta treats them to a shopping spree and a spa day. Rachel meets one of her friends, Amanda Ling (Jing Lusi), who then reveals herself as Nick's ex-girlfriend and starts trying to subtly play with Rachel's feelings. Rachel leaves the spa when she overhears the other girls making snide comments about her. She runs into Astrid, who tries to comfort her, but they then find a dead gutted fish on Rachel's bed in her room, with ""Catch this, you gold-digging bitch"" written on the window in blood. Astrid helps Rachel bury the fish on the beach that night as the other women dance and drink. Astrid then confides to Rachel that Michael is having an affair.When they reunite, Rachel tells Nick about what happened with the other women, and she is more upset that he didn't tell her about any of his past, but he felt none of it mattered. He later brings Rachel to Eleanor's house so that she can learn how to make dumplings the way Su Yi taught Nick how to do so. Rachel then notices Eleanor's ring, which she says Nick's father made to propose to her. Eleanor then makes a patronizing remark about Rachel not feeling the same way about her ""old-fashioned"" traditions. Later, as Rachel is trying to find her room, Eleanor clarifies that the ring her husband gave her was made only because Su Yi (his mother) did not initially approve of Eleanor for her son, and it took a while for her to come around. However, Eleanor makes it firmly clear to Rachel that she doesn't think Rachel is good enough for Nick.Rachel has lunch with Peik Lin and says that she may skip the wedding because she worries she may cause drama among Nick's family. Peik Lin convinces her otherwise and brings Rachel back to her house to pick out a nice outfit for the wedding with the help of Nick's cousin Oliver (Nico Santos).On the way to the wedding, Astrid confronts Michael about his affair. Michael tries to turn it around on her for making him feel inferior with her constantly buying expensive items, and he gets out of the car to leave her attending the wedding alone.Rachel turns up at the wedding and impresses everyone with her dress, and even manages to stun Amanda when she tells her she's in her way. Eleanor and her sisters note that Princess Intan (Kris Aquino) is there, and that she requested a whole row to herself so nobody could bother her. To their surprise, Rachel approaches Intan and talks to her about how she read an article about her and that Rachel admires how she spent her wealth. Intan takes a liking to Rachel, and even Nick sees how great Rachel looks. The wedding then goes on, with Nick telling Rachel he loves her and vice versa, and Colin and Araminta are married.During the reception, Eleanor orders Oliver to stop Alistair and Kitty from humping each other on the dance floor. Oliver cuts in and sends Alistair away before dancing with Kitty and telling her that if she married Alistair, she would have to wait because he's fourth in line to his family's fortune, while Bernard is the sole heir to his family's business. Meanwhile, Rachel and Nick are called to meet with Eleanor and Su Yi. Eleanor reveals she hired a private investigator to dig into Rachel's past, and it turns out that Rachel's biological father is still alive, but that Rachel's mother was previously married to another man before she cheated on him with Rachel's father and fled to America. Nick is furious at Eleanor, and Rachel runs away from the party, telling Eleanor she wants no part of her family. Nick tries to catch her but she's gone.Rachel stays with Peik Lin, depressed in her bedroom. The following morning, Rachel is surprised to find Kerry showing up to the house. When Rachel brings up the matter about her father, Kerry explains that her original husband was abusive to her, and she took comfort with a school friend that later got her pregnant with Rachel. Fearing that her husband would kill them if he found out, Kerry fled to America. She also reveals that it was Nick who called her out of concern for Rachel.Michael packs his bags to leave, but Astrid says she is instead taking Cassian with her to live in one of her other apartments. She tells Michael she can't expect him to act like a man because he isn't one. She then takes the earrings she bought earlier but hid from Michael, and she finally wears them.Nick meets with Rachel in the city by the water. He takes out his ring and proposes to her.Eleanor goes to a spot downtown where people are playing Mahjong after Rachel invited her. Rachel tells Eleanor that she turned down Nick's proposal because she doesn't want to be the reason that his family disowns him, but she notes that if he chose them over her, Nick might spend the rest of his life resenting Eleanor. Eleanor says ""only a fool folds a winning hand."" At the same time, Rachel draws a Mahjong tile which would complete her hand and win her the game. She replies that she loves Nick so much that she is willing to sacrifice her happiness for his and to remember that when Nick finds someone else in the future who Eleanor approves of and is happily married that it was her, just a daughter of an immigrant and a nobody, who made it all possible. She then throws the tile away. Eleanor picks it up and wins the Mahjong game. Rachel then shows her hand letting everyone know she just let Eleanor win and leaves with Kerry, who gives Eleanor a hard glare.Eleanor goes home to have a personal talk with Nick.Rachel and Kerry prepare to leave to go back to New York, but Nick shows up on the plane to try and talk to Rachel. He explains what his ideal proposal would have been, but he doesn't care about it because he loves her so much and would give up his whole fortune just to spend the rest of his life with her. Nick proposes once again on the airplane, but this time with Eleanor's ring, with all the passengers watching. Rachel says yes this time. Everyone cheers as she and Nick share a big kiss. Nick tells Rachel that he would like to stay just one more night.Nick later surprises Rachel by throwing an engagement party on a rooftop with all of his friends and family attending with excitement. Eleanor even manages to give Rachel a sincere smile. Rachel and Nick kiss as fireworks explode across the sky.Midway through the credits, Astrid meets a man named Charlie Wu (Harry Shum, Jr.), and there appears to be sparks between them."
Mary Poppins Returns,2018,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5028340/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A few decades after her original visit, Mary Poppins, the magical nanny, returns to help the Banks siblings and Michael's children through a difficult time in their lives. In Depression-era London, a now-grown Jane and Michael Banks, along with Michael's three children, are visited by the enigmatic Mary Poppins following a personal loss. Through her unique magical skills, and with the aid of her friend, Jack, she helps them rediscover the joy and wonder missing in their lives.—Disney Sadly, the little house on Cherry Tree Lane and the grown-up siblings, Jane and Michael Banks, are facing hard times during the worldwide 1930s Depression. However, against the backdrop of a terrible tragedy and imminent foreclosure, the beloved and nearly perfect nanny, Mary Poppins, descends from the sky to lend a hand again. Along with the cheerfully resourceful lamplighter, Jack, the Banks family is about to embark on a magical adventure, and what is more exciting is that they will even get to find happiness again. Is there anything that a dash of optimism can't cure?—Nick Riganas This sequel to the 1964 Disney film 'Mary Poppins' opens in London, England during a time that is being called a Great Slump (the Great Depression of the 1930s). A lamp lighter named Jack (Lin-Manuel Miranda) rides his bike around town, singing about the city's beauties despite the depression ((""Underneath The) Lovely London Sky""). He rides down Cherry Tree Lane where the eccentric Admiral Boom (David Warner) complains to Mr. Binnacle (Jim Norton) that Big Ben's chimes are coming in late.Michael Banks (Ben Whishaw) still lives in his parents' home as a widower with his children John (Nathanael Saleh), Annabel (Pixie Davies), and Georgie (Joel Dawson), along with housekeeper Ellen (Julie Walters). Michael's sister Jane (Emily Mortimer) is there as well, trying to help her brother handle things around the house. Two lawyers from Fidelity Fiduciary Bank, Hamilton Gooding (Jeremy Swift) and Templeton Frye (Kobna Holdbrook-Smith), show up to leave a notice of repossession on the front door. They explain that because Michael has failed to pay back a loan, his house is to be taken by the bank unless he pays it back by Friday at midnight. Michael remembers that his father kept a certificate of ownership to some shares in the bank, and he goes upstairs to find them, but he starts to worry about handling things without his wife Kate around (""A Conversation""). Jane joins him upstairs to help look for the certificate, but they instead find an old kite from their childhood. Michael dismisses it as garbage.The children go off to the shop, when the kite blows away and catches Georgie's eye. He runs after it but is pulled away by the wind, and John and Annabel run after him. Georgie is caught by Jack, who helps him fly the kite properly, but it gets pulled in by the wind. The clouds then separate, and to their surprise, down comes Mary Poppins (Emily Blunt) floating with the kite. She addresses the children by their names and greets Jack, knowing him as an apprentice of Bert the chimney sweep. Mary then guides the children back home.Upon returning to the Banks home, Michael and Jane are stunned to see Mary having come back after all these years and having not aged a single day. She tells them she has returned to look after the Banks children, meaning both Michael and Jane and Michael's kids. Mary heads up to her room to settle down. Michael and Jane remember Mary but aren't sure if all the magic they witnessed was real.Mary has the children take a bath due to them being covered in filth from running around through the park. She adds a magical soap to the water and has the children jump in to be taken to an underwater world (""Can You Imagine That?""), leaving the children in awe.Michael and Jane go to the bank to speak to its president, William Weatherall Wilkins (Colin Firth), to discuss the matter of George Banks's shares that could help save the house. Wilkins looks through his documents but claims to find nothing relating to the Banks family. He assures Michael and Jane that he will continue to look, but after they leave, he tears out the page with the Banks name on it and he throws it in the fireplace.That night, as Mary is talking to Jack, the children discuss selling their mother's China bowl to save their house. The three have an argument over it, which leads to them dropping and cracking it. Mary picks it up and shows the children that the man drawn on the bowl is talking to them because they damaged his carriage. Mary spins the bowl and transports herself, Jack, and the children into the animated world of the bowl. They meet the coachman Shamus (Chris O'Dowd), who is a dog, and his horse Clyde (Mark Addy). After fixing the carriage, Mary, Jack, and the kids join Shamus on a carriage ride as they head to a new destination (""Royal Doulton Music Hall"").The group arrives at the music hall where Mary and Jack put on a song performance with the other animal characters (""A Cover is Not The Book""). Georgie gets distracted by something outside, and he sees a wolf, a badger, and a fox (all representing Wilkins, Gooding, and Frye) taking the family's possessions away. They kidnap Georgie, prompting John and Annabel to go save him. The kids chase the villains through the bowl until they reach the edge. The wolf cracks the bowl and causes the children to fly over the edge of the bowl.Georgie wakes up as he was supposedly having a nightmare. Mary comforts him and his siblings as they miss their mother (""The Place Where Lost Things Go""), assuring them that she lives on in their hearts.The next day, Mary and Jack take the children to get the bowl fixed. They go to a shop owned by Mary's eccentric cousin Topsy (Meryl Streep). Mary forgot that they arrived on a second Wednesday, which means things go literally upside down for Topsy. With Mary's help, Topsy and the children are able to see things from a new perspective (""Turning Turtle""). Topsy agrees to fix the bowl, but she tells the children it's not worth much, and that their mother calling it ""priceless"" probably just meant that it was worth much to her.After leaving the shop, the group runs into Jane on the street as she is helping organize a rally for labor workers. Jack escorts her since he's had a crush on her since they were children. Mary and the children go to the bank to find Michael, but the children head on up to Wilkins' office where they overhear him plotting to take not only their house, but the homes of other people in London as well. They burst into his office and threaten to expose him to their father, and they run down to the lobby. When they find Michael, Wilkins denies anything about a plan to take the house, leaving Michael angry at the kids for nearly getting him in trouble.Mary and Jack walk the children back home as they run into Jack's lamp-lighting buddies, who help guide them home in song (""Trip a Little Light Fantastic"") while also showing them how to speak their lingo. When they get home, Michael appears distressed amid his worries for losing the house. The children try to cheer him up and echo Mary's words to him regarding their mother.The next night, the family has packed all their belongings and are preparing to head out. The neighbors gather around to say goodbye. Georgie then brings out the kite, and Michael takes a look to see that it's been patched up with a drawing he made of his wife and kids. When he looks closer, he sees that the drawing was made on the certificate that he had been looking for. They see that they have seven minutes to midnight, which means they won't make it before the deadline, so Mary, Jack, and the lamplighters gather to turn back time for the Banks family.Michael and Jane rush to the bank while the lamplighters gather around Big Ben and try to get Jack up to the top to reach turn back the hands. He gets inside and dims the lights so nobody can see what they are doing. Meanwhile, Wilkins is with Gooding and Frye as he waits for midnight to claims the Banks home. Mary floats up to the clock just before it strikes midnight, and she turns it back five minutes. Thinking the time is wrong, Wilkins continues to wait as Michael and Jane try to get his attention with the kite. The wind blows it inside his office, and Frye (being the only good one in the bank) lets them into the building. The children join them as they try to put the pieces together, but they are missing the piece with the signatures, which Georgie threw out. Feeling they have lost, Michael hits back at Wilkins and says he can take the house because he still has his family. Just then, Wilkins' uncle, Mr. Dawes, Jr. (Dick Van Dyke) comes back from his travels and criticizes his nephew for his dirty deeds against the people of London. Dawes comes back to take over, and he fires Wilkins. Dawes tells Michael that he knew his father and agreed that he made some good investments, so the shares will be enough to pay off the loan, and the family can keep their house.The following day, the family goes out to the park. They encounter a old woman selling balloons (Angela Lansbury), who tells the family to pick the right balloon. Michael admits that he hasn't held a balloon since he was a child, and the balloon lady tells him that he's forgotten what it's like to be a child. He grabs one, and it sends him floating in the air. The children follow suit, along with the other park patrons, plus Jane and Jack. Wilkins attempts to join, but he grabs the wrong balloon and it falls to the floor. Michael and his family float among others as they feel happy and childlike (""Nowhere To Go But Up"").As the family returns home, a gust of wind opens the front door. Mary senses this and feels it is time to go. Michael and Jane realize this, and they quietly thank Mary for everything that she has done. Jack rides his bike around town again, and Mary floats up to the skies on her umbrella to return to her realm, taking one last look behind her and smiling."
Hotel Transylvania 3: Summer Vacation,2018,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5220122/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Count Dracula and company participate in a cruise for sea-loving monsters, unaware that their boat is being commandeered by the monster-hating Van Helsing family.

The rest of Drac's Pack cannot resist going along. But once they leave port, romance arises when Dracula meets the mysterious ship Captain, Ericka. Now it's Mavis' turn to play the overprotective parent. The monster family embarks on a vacation on a luxury monster cruise ship so Drac can take a summer vacation from providing everyone else's vacation at the hotel. It's smooth sailing for Drac's Pack as the monsters indulge in all of the shipboard fun the cruise has to offer, from monster volleyball to exotic excursions, and catching up on their moon tans. But the dream vacation turns into a nightmare when Mavis realizes Drac has fallen for the mysterious captain of the ship, Ericka, who hides a dangerous secret that could destroy all of monsterkind.—Sony Pictures Entertainment When the lonely Count Dracula goes on vacation with Mavis, his family and monster friends on the cruise ship Legacy, he immediately falls in love with the human Captain Ericka. However the mysterious woman has a secret that may jeopardize Dracula, his family and the other monsters. Who is Captain Ericka?—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil It's been a tough year for the immortal bloodsucker, Count Dracula, after the events inHotel Transylvania 2 (2015), andPuppy!: A Hotel Transylvania Short (2017), and now, the lonely and stressed-out grandfather needs a vacation. Under those circumstances, a luxurious cruise along with Mavis, Jonathan, Dennis, and the Carpathian resort's friendly monster-friends, may help the overworked hotelier blow off some steam, and, perhaps, find love in the person of the ocean liner's vivacious human captain, Ericka. However, are things always what they seem? Will Dracula get a second chance at love?—Nick Riganas In 1897, Dracula (Adam Sandler) was taking a train ride with his friends, Frank (Kevin James), Griffin (David Spade), Murray (Keegan-Michael Key), and Wayne (Steve Buscemi), all of them disguised in women's dresses. Suddenly, Abraham Van Helsing (Jim Gaffigan) burst in and announced that there were monsters on the train. He held a match under Frank's nose, making him freak out. All the monsters ran and jumped onto the roof of the train, with Abraham in pursuit. Reaching the last car, Dracula pushed the rest of the monsters off to safety before Abraham cornered him. Dracula turned into a mouse just as the train entered a tunnel, and Abraham got smacked. With the train exiting the tunnel, Dracula turned into a bat and flew off, with Abraham giving chase in a biplane. Dracula kept dodging his attacks, always making him crash in painful ways. Finally, Dracula made Abraham fall into the ocean.In the present day, Dracula is hosting a monster wedding at the Hotel Transylvania. The groom is ready, but the bride is still in her room. Mavis (Selena Gomez) is with her, getting her over the jitters. She tells the bride that you only zing once in your life, and if she zinged when she first saw her fiancee, then she has nothing to worry about. Reassured, she goes down and joins the ceremony. After the wedding vows are done, Tinkles, a giant dog, burst into the room, being ridden by Dennis (Asher Blinkoff) and Winnie (Sadie Sandler). Dracula orders Tinkles to sit, and leads him out on a leash. Later, Johnny (Andy Samberg) is DJing the reception and everyone is dancing, except Dracula, since he has nobody to dance with. Suddenly, Frank's cousin grabs Dracula and starts dancing with him. He zaps the DJ table, causing a fast song to start playing, then hides behind Bigfoot's leg. Frank asks him if he liked her, and he says that he didn't zing with her.Alone in the attic, Dracula tries to use his phone to look for a date, but it keeps mishearing what he wants. Mavis walks past and hears him through the door as he uses the ZINGR app to look at pictures. Unable to swipe correctly with his long fingers, he accidentally connects with a witch when Mavis pokes her head in. He cuts off the call, and Mavis says he's been working too hard. She goes to her room and cuddles with Johnny and the kids, when a commercial comes on the TV, advertising a monster vacation.In a rickety old plane, Dracula, Mavis, Johnny, Frank and Eunice (Fran Drescher), Wayne and Wanda (Molly Shannon) and their pups, Griffin, Blobby (Genndy Tartakovsky) and Vlad (Mel Brooks) are all riding toward the Bermuda Triangle. Dennis and Winnie had secretly stowed Tinkles in the luggage compartment. The plane crash lands and everyone gets out and makes their way to an aircraft carrier. The crew leader, Stan the fish man (Chris Parnell) greets them, and the cruise sets off. Griffin, traveling with his invisible girlfriend, Crystal (Chrissy Teigen), sees Dracula looking unenthusiastic. The ship's captain, Ericka (Kathryn Hahn) greets everyone in multiple languages, and Dracula's face freezes. She walks up to him and tries to talk, but he can only speak gibberish. His friends try to snap him back, and he tells them that when he saw her, he zinged.Later that night, the monsters are dancing, swimming and doing other fun activities. Blobby, feeling seasick, changes colors and vomits, producing a Baby Blobby (Genndy Tartakovsky) who hugs him. Wayne and Wanda see a room labeled Kid's Club, and they happily drop off the pups for the day. In her stateroom, Ericka greets her great-grandfather, Abraham Van Helsing, who is now in a wheelchair. She tells him that he was right, monsters are disgusting, and she wanted to kill Dracula the first time she talked to him. He tells her to be patient, and doing research, he read about the ultimate device, one that destroyed the city of Atlantis. He tells her to lure them all to Atlantis, and he'll use the machine to kill them all.Still determined to kill Dracula, Ericka hides and takes many shots at him, but he always manages to just avoid her blows, not even realizing what's happening. Meeting his friends, he tells them that he always thought you could only zing once in your life, and he already had with his late wife, Martha. They all jump in the pool and start a game of volleyball when Ericka's voice comes on the speakers and tells them they've arrived at their first destination, the underwater volcano. They all grab scuba gear and jump into the volcano. Ericka fills a vessel with wooden stakes and chases after the group. Dracula hypnotizes a shark, and he and Dennis ride it around, with Ericka still secretly following. She tries to shoot wooden harpoons at him, but keeps just missing. Seeing the vessel, Dracula grabs the tail end and poses for a picture from Mavis. Panicked, Ericka launches herself out. Looking at the picture, Mavis sees what looks like human feet in the corner. Reaching the surface, Ericka sputters and gets back on the ship. Frank, Murray and Griffin are also on board getting snacks, when they hear Ericka muttering. Keeping themselves hidden, they hear her vow that she's going to get Dracula. Misunderstanding her, they think she's in love with him too.With everyone back on the ship, the guys run up to Dracula, and then see that Mavis is with him. Fearing her reaction to hearing about Ericka, they lead him away, and then tell him that Ericka likes him. Just then, Ericka walks up and listens in as they ask if he's going to ask her out. At first, she's disgusted, but then she realizes she has an opportunity. Pretending she just walked up, she greets him and says she'd love to go on a date. Arriving at the next destination, the deserted island, Dracula volunteers to take Dennis, so that Johnny and Mavis can enjoy themselves. At a restaurant, Mavis asks Johnny if he noticed Dracula's been acting weird, and he tells her that Dracula has a crush on the captain. Taken by surprise, Mavis says that she never imagined him with anyone except her mom, but she does want him to be happy. In the cantina, Ericka orders guacamole for Dracula, then secretly dumps garlic oil on it. She takes a chip, dunks it in the guacamole and feeds it to him. He swallows, and then his stomach starts to rumble. He asks if there was garlic in the food, and she lies and says she doesn't know. She asks if that's deadly for him, but he says that it only makes him gassy. He tells her he's nervous, since he hasn't been on a date since his wife died. He explains that he built the hotel so that he and Mavis could have a safe place to live. Touched by his obvious love for his daughter, she replies that she never knew her mother or father, and she was raised by her great-grandfather. Growing up on the ship, she tells him that it was always expected that she'd be captain one day. He says it's important to honor the past, but to make your own future. Thinking about that, she realizes that she doesn't want to be on the ship forever.Mavis and Johnny walk up to the table. Panicked, Ericka realizes she lost focus on her mission, and she quickly excuses herself. Mavis reminds Dracula that he was going to spend time with Dennis, and he hurries off to find him. Sitting down at the table, Mavis tells Johnny there's something she doesn't trust about Ericka. Johnny eats a chip with guacamole, then warns Mavis that it's loaded with garlic. Mavis realizes what Ericka is up to. Wayne and Wanda, still relieved to be pup-free, are running around the deck. Ericka hides from them, and is surprised to hear Abraham's voice coming from a vent. He tells her he knows she's been trying to kill Dracula, and that it could blow the whole plan. Making another lap, Wayne and Wanda run up to them, and Abraham quickly puts tranquilizer darts in their necks, and they fall to the ground, unconscious.Arriving at Atlantis, they all go into a casino. Eunice makes Frank promise not to gamble, since the last time he did, he lost an arm and a leg. Dracula asks the guys if they've seen Mavis, and he tells them that he's going to tell her about Ericka. Mavis and Johnny see Dracula on the floor, and she notices that he's following Ericka around. Suspicious, she tails after them, and Ericka goes into a hidden room. Arriving at a pool, she takes off her clothes, revealing a wet suit she was wearing underneath, and dives in. Dracula follows her, unseen, and she emerges at the ruins of a palace. At the end of a hallway is a strange glowing device, and she makes her way to it. She steps on a stone and sets off a booby trap, sending an ax flying toward her head. Dracula quickly grabs the ax and tosses it aside. She realizes that he's been following her, and he saved her life without thinking. She starts to think that everything she was told about monsters was wrong. He asks her what she's doing, and she lies and says that the device is an old family heirloom, and she wants to get it back. Taking another step, she sets off a second booby trap, and Dracula grabs another ax out of the air. Testing him, she skips forward, setting off all the traps, with him saving her every time. He ends up with axes, darts and arrows embedded all over his body. She grabs the device, causing the room to shake and crumble, and he flies her out just before she gets crushed.Mavis catches up to them, and sees Dracula looking like a pincushion from the traps. Her eyes turn angry, and she levitates Ericka up. Dracula tells her to stop, then says that when he first saw her, he zinged. Stunned, Mavis drops Ericka, and she asks what a zing is. Dracula explains that it's a love at first sight for monsters. Feeling guilty, Ericka tells him that she can never be with a monster, and she runs off. Mavis hugs Dracula, and he sulks away.Back on the ship, Murray shows off the tattoo he got last night, and Griffin and Crystal walk up, with her wearing a wedding ring on her invisible finger. Frank and Eunice arrive, and he has no arms, having lost them gambling. In her room, Ericka shows the device to Abraham, and then tells him that Dracula saved her life. She says the way he acted with Mavis was almost human, and he replies that monsters have no feelings, and they must fulfill the mission. The next day, Frank has replaced his arms with lobster claws from the seafood buffet. At a dance party, Mavis is still trying to process the fact that Dracula zinged with Ericka, and Johnny tells her that love makes them do crazy things. He reminds her that they were different species, but when they zinged, nothing could keep them apart. Realizing that Johnny was right, she runs up to talk to Dracula. She tells him that he has to tell Ericka how he feels, and he starts off to find her. Just then, the music stops, and Abraham's face comes on the monitors. He says he knows that Dracula recognizes him, and he holds up the device. Dracula says that it's just Ericka's heirloom, but Abraham reveals that Ericka retrieved it because she's his great-granddaughter. He shows them that it's a canister with sheet music. He plays the music on a piano, stirring a creature known as the Kraken.With the Kraken swatting at the guests, Dracula flies toward Abraham, but is caught by the Kraken in midair. He tries to free himself by changing forms, but the Kraken maintains its grip. Ericka looks at him sadly. Trapped and growing weaker, Dracula submits to defeat. Mavis tries to save him, but the Kraken pins her down, and throws Dracula into the air toward his mouth. At the last second, Ericka jumps and bounces off Blobby, and she grabs Dracula out of the air. They land in water at the edge of the dance floor, and she holds him up and tells Abraham that he can't kill Dracula. She says monsters have families, and laugh and love just like people. She says she knows it because when she first saw Dracula, she zinged.With renewed determination, Dracula starts to fight back against the Kraken. Johnny stops him and tells him that the only way to fight the ominous music that Abraham is playing is with happy music. He sets up his DJ equipment and plays ""Good Vibrations."" The Kraken starts to sway to the beat, until Abraham makes his music louder, causing the Kraken to resume the attack. Finding an even brighter song, Johnny plays ""Don't Worry, Be Happy,"" and the Kraken starts swaying again. Abraham makes his music louder still, and Johnny realizes he needs the ultimate musical weapon, and starts playing ""The Macarena."" Soon, both the Kraken and Abraham are moving their arms to the music, unable to control themselves. Abraham falls off the DJ booth and toward the water, and Dracula turns into a bat and flies up to him, grabbing him before he hits. Dracula returns Abraham to the dance floor, and he asks why he had saved him. Dracula says that human or monster, we are all the same. Ericka runs up and hugs him, and Abraham sheepishly offers them all a full refund for the cruise. The wolf pups stampede around the deck, and everyone realizes they haven't seen Wayne and Wanda in a long time. Ericka takes them to the closet where she had hidden them, and Dracula zaps them back to life.Back at the hotel, Dracula and Ericka sneak up to the roof, and she asks if he's going to suck her blood. He responds by getting down on one knee and opening a box with a spider-shaped ring with a red jewel. The ring claws its way onto her finger, and she tries to answer, but can only speak gibberish. Everyone else shows up and asks what her answer was. Recovering, she says yes, and everyone cheers. Tinkles happily runs in and tackles them both. A happy new chapter had begun at the Hotel Transylvania."
Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald,2018,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4123430/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The second installment of the ""Fantastic Beasts"" series featuring the adventures of Magizoologist Newt Scamander. In an effort to thwart Grindelwald's plans of raising pure-blood wizards to rule over all non-magical beings, Albus Dumbledore enlists his former student Newt Scamander, who agrees to help, though he's unaware of the dangers that lie ahead. Lines are drawn as love and loyalty are tested, even among the truest friends and family, in an increasingly divided wizarding world.—sunny skies In 1927, the Magical Congress of the United States of America (MACUSA) is transferring the powerful dark wizard Gellert Grindelwald from their maximum security prison to London to be tried for his crimes in Europe. Grindelwald escapes during the transfer, aided by his follower and MACUSA employee, Abernathy. Three months later in London, Newt Scamander appeals to the Ministry of Magic to restore his revoked international travel rights following his misadventure in New York City. While at the Ministry, Newt runs into Leta Lestrange, an old Hogwarts classmate who is engaged to his brother, Theseus, an Auror in the Department of Magical Law Enforcement. The Ministry offers to restore Newt's travel rights if he assists Theseus in locating the obscurity Credence Barebone, who has resurfaced in Paris. Credence may be Leta's long-lost brother, Corvus Lestrange, the last of a long line of pure-blood wizards. Grindelwald believes only Credence can kill his equal, Hogwarts Professor Albus Dumbledore. Newt, however, declines, refusing to choose sides, and the Auror Grimmson is dispatched instead.. Gellert Grindelwald has escaped imprisonment and begun gathering followers, most unsuspecting of his true agenda: elevating wizards above muggles. Grindelwald's former friend Albus Dumbledore is the only one capable of stopping him, but he needs help from his former student Newt Scamander.—Sean Rawlinson During a stormy night, the dangerous dark wizard, Gellert Grindelwald, breaks out of his maximum-security cell and escapes MACUSA custody, only a few months after levelling New York City inFantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (2016). Hell-bent on sparking a global movement against the inferior Muggles, all-powerful Grindelwald tries to assemble more followers, desperately seeking out a troubled young obscurial: a person of vital importance to the ultimate success of his masterful plan. Now, before this terrible new threat, Hogwarts' headmaster, Professor Albus Dumbledore, enlists the help of former student Newt Scamander to take part in the effort to thwart the sorcerer's scheme. Because, more and more, Paris becomes a fateful battlefield. But one question remains unanswered. Will evil Grindelwald ever pay for his crimes?—Nick Riganas New York, 1927Notorious dark wizard Gellert Grindelwald (Johnny Depp) is being imprisoned by the American Ministry of Magic. MACUSA President Seraphina Picquery (Carmen Ejogo) oversees Grindelwald as he is being transferred to London with one of her employees, Abernathy (Kevin Guthrie). As they become airborne in a carriage pulled by Thestrals, it becomes apparent that Grindelwald and Abernathy have switched places, as Abernathy has always been loyal to Grindelwald. Abernathy fills the carriage with water while Grindelwald diverts the Thestrals' path. They kill two guards, while a third, Spielman (Wolf Roth), survives his fall. Grindelwald then proceeds to head out and find the rest of his followers.LondonNewt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne) is being prepped for a hearing with the British Ministry of Magic. He meets with an old Hogwarts' friend, Leta Lestrange (Zoe Kravitz), who is engaged to Newt's brother Theseus (Callum Turner), with whom Newt has a bit of a strained relationship. Newt enters the meeting to have his right to travel reinstated after the events that took place in New York when Newt's beasts were loose and the Obscurial Credence Barebone (Ezra Miller) wreaked havoc. Although Newt believed Credence to be dead, he is told that Credence is alive and has resurfaced in Paris. Newt is given a chance to get his travel rights back under the condition that he works under Theseus at the Ministry to help find Credence since they know that Grindelwald is trying to find him and lure him to his side, but Newt refuses to work with his brother. An Auror named Grimmson (Ingvar Eggert Sigurosson) takes on the task, though he appears to have sinister intentions.Grindelwald and his followers meet in a private residence to discuss going off to find Credence. In another room next to them, they find a male toddler who can't yet comprehend what is going on. Grindelwald has one of his followers, Carrow (Maja Bloom), use the Killing Curse on him.Newt leaves the Minstry building and finds a glove tapping him and pointing at him to meet on top of a building. He grabs the glove and is apparated to meet with his former professor, the great Albus Dumbledore (Jude Law). They meet privately as Dumbledore also tasks Newt with going off to find Credence in Paris since he may be in danger or be a danger to others. He also leaves Newt with a card with an address for a safe house in Paris. Newt is reluctant to take on this mission, but Dumbledore informs him that it must be him since Dumbledore cannot move against Grindelwald.Newt returns home to his assistant Bunty (Victoria Yeates), who has scrapes on her arm after handling his Kelpie (like a giant magic seahorse). After dealing with baby Nifflers and the Kelpie, he hears a noise coming from his room. To Newt's surprise, he finds Jacob Kowalski (Dan Fogler) and Queenie Goldstein (Alison Sudol) in his room, having apparated all the way from New York. Newt is surprised that Jacob remembers him despite being Obliviated, but Jacob explains that Queenie filled him in on the bad things. Newt is also disappointed to hear that Tina (Katherine Waterston) is not there and has been seeing another Auror after a mistake in a magazine led her to believe that Newt was engaged to Leta instead of Theseus. Newt quickly discovers that Queenie has enchanted Jacob to make him love her, and she reluctantly allows Newt to remove the enchantment. Although a bit displeased at being bewitched, Jacob follows Queenie as she leaves Newt's place to tell her she didn't need to use magic on him because he already loved her. However, they get into an argument due to the laws against magical folk being in relationships with muggles/no-majes. Queenie reads Jacob's mind and hears him call her crazy, so she leaves him. He returns to Newt's place and joins him as they head to Paris.In Paris, we find Credence working at a freak show under the cruel ringmaster Skender (Olafur Dari Olafsson). Credence is close to Nagini (Claudia Kim), a young woman who is a Maledictus, meaning she is cursed to transform into a snake until one day when the transformation becomes permanent (she will later become Voldemort's pet snake). Skender puts on a show for people to have Nagini shapeshift for them, with Tina in attendance. Credence lets loose a bunch of small creatures that create sparks, leading to chaos in the tent. This allows Credence to get away with Nagini while Tina tries to contain the situation. Skender just takes everything with him and gets out. As Tina walks away, she is found by Yusuf Kama (William Nadylam), who was also in attendance at the show. He talks to Tina and tells her that he is looking for Credence. Yusuf tells Tina he is the last of a pure-blood line, as is Credence.Grindelwald knows where Credence is headed, to find his birth mother. He plans to use the boy in eliminating Dumbledore.Newt and Jacob take a Portkey to Paris since it's the only way Newt can travel out of the country discreetly. Once they get there, Newt uses a spell to detect Tina's last movements in the area so that he can trace her location, as well as Yusuf's. Meanwhile, Queenie is also in Paris to find Tina. She goes to the French Ministry of Magic for a lead, but gets no help. At the same time, Abernathy and another Grindelwald follower, Rosier (Poppy Corby-Tuech) are lurking in the same building. Queenie is outside the building and overhears Newt and Jacob walking by her. She attempts to follow them but is overwhelmed when she starts to hear everyone's thoughts. Queenie is then found by Rosier, who invites her to join her.Credence and Nagini arrive at the home of Irma Dugard (Danielle Hugues), the woman Credence was led to believe is his mother. She turns out to only be the nurse who delivered Credence and wrote her name on the documents. Irma embraces Credence moments before they are found by Grimmson. He fires a blast that kills Irma. Credence becomes enraged and takes on his Obscurial form, attempting to attack Grimmson, but he shields himself from Credence's moves, though Credence still manages to destroy most of the house. Credence and Nagini get away, and Grimmson goes to report on what he saw to Grindelwald.Newt and Jacob find Yusuf on the streets. They approach him and ask if he has seen Tina. Yusuf guides the two to a cell where he has imprisoned Tina, and does so with Newt and Jacob as well. Outside, a Zouwu (a large cat-like creature) is on the loose. The three manage to free themselves and subdue Yusuf so that Newt can go out and lure the Zouwu with a toy and keep him in his briefcase with the other fantastic beasts.At Hogwarts, Dumbledore's Defense Against The Dark Arts class is interrupted by Torquil Travers (Derek Riddell) from the British Ministry. Dumbledore sends his students out with Professor McGonnagall (Fiona Glascott). Travers tasks Dumbledore with taking down Grindelwald. He knows that the two of them were once close like brothers, though Dumbledore states they were closer than that. When Dumbledore says he cannot fight Grindelwald, Travers tells him he can no longer teach DATDA. Dumbledore later finds the Mirror of Erised and sees himself and Grindelwald as younger men making an Unbreakable Vow.We catch up with Leta and see a flashback from her days at Hogwarts (here played by Thea Lamb) where she was bullied by other students, so she in turn curses them in ways such as making a girl's mouth disappear. She and Newt (here played by Joshua Shea) were each other's only friends, and he would take the blame for her wrongdoings. While in Dumbledore's DATDA class, the students are handling a Boggart (the being that shows people what they fear most). It turns into a desk for Newt since his worst fear is working in an office, but for Leta, it turns into a white sheet holding something inside. Afterwards, Newt shows Leta a tree where he finds Bowtruckles that have come to trust him. Back in the present, Dumbledore finds Leta. She asks him if he considered her as bad as the others did. He says no, and she replies that he is the only one who didn't see her as such.Rosier brings Queenie to the hideout where she comes face-to-face with Grindelwald. Although Queenie is prepared to defend herself against him, he calmly speaks to her and entices her when bringing up the matter of loving who she wants to love.Newt, Tina, and Jacob take an unconscious Yusuf back to his place. Tina wants to question Yusuf since he might know the truth about Credence. They look into his eyes and see a parasite in there. Newt and Tina manage to pull it out. Tina plans to take back her information to the Ministry, appearing to still be agitated with Newt over not telling her about him and Leta. Newt explains the confusion from what she read. Just then, they look up at the sky and see what look like black drapes sweeping across the sky, indicating that Grindelwald is summoning his followers. Newt and Tina plan to go to the French Ministry to find a box that contains the truth about Credence, while Grindelwald finds Credence and Nagini to try and lure them to his side.Jacob is left alone in the house where he meets the famed alchemist Nicolas Flamel (Brontis Jodorowsky). He shows Jacob a crystal ball where he sees the whereabouts of Credence and Queenie. Flamel tells Jacob that Queenie is going to be at a cemetery in Paris. As Jacob is heading out to leave, he notices that Yusuf is gone. Flamel then goes into his closet (where he just so happens to be keeping the Sorcerer's Stone) and takes out a book to talk to a woman named Eulalie Hicks (Jessica Williams), as he knows that Grindelwald is rallying his followers at the cemetery, and he fears there will be death.Newt uses Polyjuice Potion to disguise himself as Theseus to get inside the Ministry. They enter the records room and also take a moment to almost express their mutual feelings for one another. Theseus spots Newt and goes after him and Tina. As they hide, they overhear Leta reading a note saying that Lestrange family records have been moved to their family tomb. Leta finds Newt and Tina, and the records keeper finds them and sics her Matagots (creepy panther-like beasts) after Leta tries to defend herself against them. Newt brings the Zouwu out and it helps them escape.Newt, Tina, and Leta come across Credence, Nagini, and Yusuf. Yusuf reveals that he has been looking for Credence because he wants to kill him, as Yusuf's mother Laurena (Isaura Barbe-Brown) was taken against her will by Corvus Lestrange Sr (Keith Chanter) under the Imperius curse, who impregnated her with a child before she ultimately died. That child was Leta. Corvus Sr remarried and had another child, Corvus Jr, Leta's half-brother, whom Yusuf believes Credence to be. However, Leta says that Corvus Jr is dead because she was the one who killed him. As a child, she was on a boat with Irma, and the baby Corvus would not stop crying. Leta switched him with a quiet, sleeping baby just before the ship started to sink. Leta was on one lifeboat with the other baby, while Corvus was on a different lifeboat that capsized, and he drowned as a result (this is the form that the Boggart took for Leta). Leta has lived with this guilt ever since.As part of his plan, everyone heads to the cemetery where Grindelwald has gathered his followers and set up for Credence to go to him. Jacob finds Queenie, who invites him to join and watch what Grindelwald has to say. The dark wizard preaches about their supremacy over non-magic folks. He shows them future images of World War II to show just how flawed the non-magic community is and how they will only bring their own world into ruins. Theseus leads Ministry Aurors there to stop them, along with Newt, Tina, Yusuf, Leta, Flamel, and Travers. Grindelwald's followers get away just as he creates a Protego Diabolica spell that spreads a powerful blue flame with a dragon-like form to spread across Paris. Several wizards are killed in the fire as the Aurors attempt to stop it. Grindelwald calls for new followers to join him. Credence decides to join, despite Nagini trying to pull him away. Queenie does so as well, even trying to get Jacob to go with her, but he cannot bring himself to do so and watches as Queenie leaves with him. Leta appears to try and join Grindelwald, but she instead makes an attempt to kill him. Grindelwald ends up burning her to ashes, to the horror of Newt and Theseus. Grindelwald disapparates with Credence and Queenie. The Aurors then manage to stop the fire from spreading. Newt then embraces Theseus as they mourn Leta.Newt takes a vial of blood that his Niffler nicked off of Grindelwald and brings it to Dumbledore at Hogwarts. This blood pact is the reason that Dumbledore cannot fight Grindelwald, as this is their Unbreakable Vow. Dumbledore tells Newt that he may be able to destroy it.Grindelwald brings Credence and Queenie to a new hideout. He tells Credence his true name: Aurelius Dumbledore, making him Albus' brother. Grindelwald tells Credence that only he can destroy Dumbledore. Credence then tests out the strength of his power by blasting the side of a mountain."
Halloween,2018,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1502407/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Laurie Strode confronts her long-time foe, Michael Myers, the masked figure who has haunted her since she narrowly escaped his killing spree on Halloween night four decades ago. Jamie Lee Curtis returns to her iconic role as Laurie Strode, who comes to her final confrontation with Michael Myers (Nick Castle and James Jude Courtney), the masked figure who has haunted her since she narrowly escaped his killing spree on Halloween night four decades ago. It's been 40 years since Laurie Strode survived a vicious attack from crazed killer Michael Myers on Halloween night. Locked up in an institution, Myers manages to escape when his bus transfer goes horribly wrong. Laurie now faces a terrifying showdown when the masked madman returns to Haddonfield, Ill. -- but this time, she's ready for him. Still living in dread of having to face Michael, the person who destroyed her life, lucky survivor Laurie Strode has been bracing herself up for the past forty years for another encounter with the maniacal serial killer. And in 2018, four painful decades after the bloodbath in Haddonfield and the shocking events ofHalloween (1978), her fears come true as Myers escapes from the custody of Dr Sartain in Smith's Grove Sanitarium. Now, Michael's butcher knife has the final say, and even though no one seems to believe in the existence of pure evil, Laurie is determined to stand up for herself and rid the town of the nightmare once and for all. But has Laurie what it takes to look evil in the eye and confront the Boogeyman?—Nick Riganas Forty years after the Haddonfield murders in 1978, two journalists, Aaron Korey and Dana Haines, travel to Smith's Grove Sanitarium to interview Michael Myers, who was captured after Dr. Samuel Loomis shot him off of the Doyle house balcony at the end of the movie. Dr. Ranbir Sartain, Michael's new psychiatrist after Dr. Loomis' death, inform them that Michael is able to speak, but chooses not to. Dana records the event as Aaron approaches Michael and talks to him, but fails to get him to speak, even after showing him his mask and mentioning Laurie Strode.The two journalists leave Smith's Grove Sanitarium and drive to Laurie's house, a heavily fortified and decrepit homestead, and bribe her for an interview, which she reluctantly accepts. Laurie has spent the last forty years dealing with post-traumatic stress and preparing for Michael's inevitable return. Her feelings have resulted in two failed marriages and losing custody of her daughter Karen at a young age. Aaron and Dana tell Laurie their interest in finding out why Michael committed the murders in 1978 and ask her to meet with him in a final attempt to get him to speak before he's transferred to a maximum security prison. Laurie kicks them out of her house, but not before taking the money they offered.As the transport is being prepared and patients are loaded onto the bus, Dr. Sartain insists on accompanying Michael, and the bus departs. In Haddonfield, Laurie's granddaughter and Karen's daughter, Allyson, is walking to school with two friends and tells them the stress that her family endures due to her grandmother's past, and debunks the town rumor that Michael is Laurie's brother. In class, Allyson looks out of the window to see Laurie watching her. She meets with her grandmother who gives her the three thousand dollars from Aaron and Dana and tells her to have fun. During a family dinner at Karen's house, Laurie arrives and has a panic attack and Allyson comforts her. Meanwhile, the bus transport crashed in a ditch, the security guards were killed, and the inmates were scattered about the road. A man and his son driving down the road happen upon the bus and investigate. While the father disappears, his son grabs a rifle from the truck and encounters a fatally wounded security guard that tells him to run. He investigates the bus and is startled by Dr. Sartain, shooting him in the shoulder accidentally. Fleeing back to the truck, he calls the police; Michael appears from the back seat and kills him.The following morning, Sheriff Frank Hawkins explains to a deputy that Michael Myers escaped the transport and will most certainly return to Haddonfield to finish what he started four decades prior. Aaron and Dana arrive at a gas station; Dana leaves Aaron to use the bathroom while he goes inside to pay for the gas. With the inside of the station deserted, he stumbles upon a dead mechanic missing his overalls and a cashier whose jaw was ripped open. Meanwhile, Michael attacks Dana in the bathroom, and when Aaron arrives to save Dana, Michael kills him by bashing him into the door numerous times, killing him, before strangling Dana to death. Michael inspects their vehicle and recovers his mask, putting it on. Laurie learns about the transport crash and breaks into Karen's house to demonstrate her lack of security. After a brief argument about Michael with Karen and her husband, Ray, Laurie leaves and heads to the gas station in time to witness the bodies of Aaron and Dana being recovered.On Halloween night, Michael wanders a populated street in Haddonfield, littered with families and children trick-or-treating. He finds his way into a shed behind a house and takes a hammer before going inside to kill the sole occupant. He replaces the hammer with a kitchen knife and moves to the house next door, killing another woman by stabbing the knife through her throat. Allyson is at a school-sanctioned Halloween party with her friends and receives a call from Vicky, inviting her to come over once Julian, the kid she's babysitting, falls asleep. Allyson gets into an altercation with her boyfriend, Cameron, who throws her phone, just as Laurie was calling to warn her to go home. At Julian's house, he tells Vicky that he saw a masked man standing in the doorway, but Vicky dismisses it as his imagination and puts Julian to bed as her boyfriend, Dave, arrives. As Vicky checks the closet at Julian's request, she opens the door and is attacked by Michael who was hiding inside; Julian flees the house and calls the police. Laurie, patrolling the streets in her truck, hears the dispatch call on her CB radio and hurries to the house, where Sheriff Hawkins is investigating. He finds Vicky's corpse and Laurie shoots Michael through a window, only to find out it's his reflection in a mirror. Laurie and Hawkins patrol behind the neighboring houses and find Michael; Laurie shoots him, but as she turns the corner, Michael is gone.Allyson ditches her boyfriend at the party and allows her friend Oscar to walk her home. Allyson rejects his advances and Oscar lags behind, spotting Michael watching him. Oscar tries to escape, but is caught on a fence and Michael impales him. Allyson turns back and finds Oscar's body and is chased by Michael before finding refuge in a neighboring home. Karen and Ray arrive at Laurie's fortified home and wait for Allyson to arrive. Hawkins encounters Dr. Sartain and in turn, find Allyson during their search for Michael. Finding Michael, Hawkins runs him over with the police SUV and gets out of the vehicle to shoot Michael at point-blank range, despite Dr. Sartain's protests. Dr. Sartain stabs Hawkins in the throat with a blade hidden inside of a pen and kills him before taking Michael's mask and trying it on. Dr. Sartain loads Michael into the back of the vehicle with Allyson and drives to Laurie's house, intent on reuniting them. Michael regains consciousness and reclaims his mask, and Allyson informs Dr. Sartain that Michael spoke to her; distracted by demanding to know what Michael said, Michael breaks through the security barrier, forces Dr. Sartain out of the vehicle, and stomps on his head as Allyson flees on foot.Ray steps outside to offer coffee to the police officers stationed outside Laurie's house and finds them dead. Michael appears behind Ray and strangles him. Laurie alerts Karen to Michael's arrival and sends her into the hidden safe room as she locks and barricades the front door. Michael breaks through the glass panels in the door and attacks Laurie, who escapes by shooting Michael's hand with a shotgun, stripping him of two fingers, forcing him to retreat. Laurie patrols her house room by room and seals each room off with security gates. Laurie encounters Michael upstairs; Allyson arrives as Laurie and Michael stab each other and witnesses Laurie fall from the balcony. When she investigates, Laurie is gone and Allyson makes her way into the safe room with Karen, who alerts Michael. As he appears, Karen shoots him with a rifle and stuns him. Laurie appears from the shadows and attacks Michael, sending him tumbling down the steps into the safe room.Karen and Allyson leave the safe room, but Michael regains consciousness and grabs Karen's ankle. Allyson stabs Michael with his own knife and the two escape the room. Laurie flips a switch and metal bars spring into place, barricading the exit and trapping Michael in the safe room as it fills with gas. Laurie lights a flare and tosses it through the bars, setting the room ablaze with Michael in it. Laurie, Karen, and Allyson escape as the house is engulfed in flames and hitch a ride in the back of a pickup truck coming down the road. The three women embrace as they're taken to safety."
The Meg,2018,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4779682/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A group of scientists exploring the Marianas Trench encounter the largest marine predator that has ever existed - the Megalodon. Five years ago, expert sea diver and Naval Captain Jonas Taylor encountered an unknown danger in the unexplored recesses of the Mariana Trench that forced him to abort his mission and abandon half his crew. Though the tragic incident earned him a dismissal from service, what ultimately cost him his career, his marriage and any semblance of honor was his unsupported and incredulous claims of what caused it - an attack on his vessel by a mammoth, 70-foot sea creature, believed to be extinct for more than a million years. But when a submersible lies sunk and disabled at the bottom of the ocean - carrying his ex-wife among the team onboard - he is the one who gets the call.

All seems well at first, but the trio is attacked and stranded by something large and fast, causing them to lose contact with Mana One. They later try getting power back up and running, but are attacked again and Lori is wounded by a screwdriver getting rammed into her stomach. The rest of the crew, after much debate, decide to take Mac's advice and call Jonas in to help rescue their stranded friends due to his experience with rescuing people from such a deep, dangerous area of the ocean. However, Heller is against this as he thinks Jonas went crazy from his traumatic experience five years ago and doesn't believe Jonas' claims that something attacked him and the divers he was trying to rescue. The plan goes ahead regardless.Unfortunately, Jonas has clearly seen better days, as he's seen in a Taiwanese bar drinking regularly and pissing off local boat owners whom he keeps blowing off repairing their boats. Mac and Dr. Zhang meet with Jonas back in his room. Jonas at first tries to weasel out of the situation by offering the two drinks and preemptively rebuking any offers of money. In the end, however, he agrees to come along and help.Meanwhile, Suyin tries to go down and rescue the trapped crew herself in a mini-sub shortly after Jonas arrives. Jonas takes off after her to help, but not before promising Suyin's young daughter Meiying (Shuya Sophia Cai) that he'll bring her mom back safe and sound. Suyin quickly finds the stuck sub and preps to tow them back to the surface when a giant squid attacks her. Before it looks like her sub will be damaged, the squid is quickly killed by the culprit of the previous attack: a 75-foot-long prehistoric monster shark called a Megalodon. This shark is the same one Jonas encountered five years back that almost killed him, thus proving his sanity. Jonas briefly lures the shark away with some flairs and has Suyin escape back to the surface. He succeeds in getting Lori and ""The Wall"" on board his vehicle. However, the shark comes back for another attack, and Toshi sacrifices himself so the others can escape, stuffing a goodbye letter to his wife that he was writing earlier into ""The Wall""'s pocket. The shark rams the downed second sub, killing Toshi, while everyone else gets to safety. Heller later apologizes to Jonas for not believing his claims.The situation isn't over yet, as the sub's destruction has caused a temporary pocket of heat to vent upwards and allow the shark to move to normal ocean waters. While Jonas tries to leave and everyone else talks among themselves, Meiying is playing with an RC ball through the halls but is frightened by the sudden appearance of the shark. The shark tries to bite through the hull but fails and leaves after killing a whale. The group ultimately decides to track and poison the shark to death via a small boat. At first they succeed in tracking it using Jonas to shoot the tracker onto its fin and then reel him back in, just BARELY avoiding getting eaten by the shark. Then Suyin goes down in a plastic tank to poison it while the others lure the shark in with chum. This leads to an intense confrontation where the shark tries to swallow the cage whole with her in it. She succeeds in poisoning the shark, but her mask breaks, and she nearly drowns. Jonas dives in after her, and they almost get eaten by the shark. Fortunately, the poison kicks in and the shark dies. Jonas gets Suyin back aboard, and they resuscitate her back to life.The crew initially celebrates by taking pictures of ""The Wall"" with the shark's corpse before he falls into the water due to a prank from DJ. Jonas, however, notices the shark's teeth are smaller than the one from earlier, indicating the Megalodon they killed is smaller and younger than the beast they've been hunting. Suddenly, the other bigger shark from before arrives, swallowing ""The Wall"" whole and grabbing the other Meg's corpse off the boat with its teeth. The boat capsizes and Dr. Zhang is severely injured. The shark comes back around to try and eat Jaxx, but Heller sacrifices himself by attracting the shark to him instead, and he is eaten. The surviving crew escape using motorboats and Morris calls in a support helicopter to shoot at the shark, successfully chasing it away. However, Dr. Zhang dies from his wounds in the boat, but not before tearful last words of pride to his daughter.Later that night, Morris tells the crew that they're shutting down Mana One and the authorities in multiple Asian countries have been called to deal with the shark. However, it turns out he's lying through his teeth, and he actually called in some minor military support to try and kill the shark on his own using depth charges dropped from the helicopter. He goes out on a boat with some others, and it seems to work at first, only for it to turn out they just blew up and killed a whale instead, luring some nearby regular sharks (and later the Meg, who scares them off) to feast on its corpse. Morris gets knocked off the escaping boat and tries to climb onto the dead whale, only to be eaten whole by the shark.The crew finds out the shark is heading for a nearby popular beach in China and plans to lure the shark away from the beach with whale noise recordings and then torpedo it to hell with the mini-subs. The shark initially attacks a nearby Chinese wedding party on another boat and seemingly eats the bride's dog Pippin, before briefly terrorizing the locals at the beach. It stops attacking when it hears the whale noises and takes the bait. This leads into a massive chase between Jonas and the shark, as he leads it to Suyin who hits it with a torpedo, but it does nothing. Even worse, is that Jonas' torpedo won't fire. During the fight, a group of news helicopters trying to film the action stupidly crash into each other and the wreckage crashes onto the team's boat, forcing everyone into the water. Suyin goes to help the others, while Jonas, in an attempt to protect everyone, goes head-on with the shark, slicking its underbelly open badly with the sub. He then gets out of the sub once the shark tries mauling it and stabs it through the eye, mortally wounding it. A dozen regular sharks move in to finish it off and eat it alive, ending the threat.With the danger passed, everyone regroups aboard the wedding couple's boat, including Pippin the dog, who turned out to have survived. Jonas and Suyin are presumably now a couple, their romance being hinted at throughout earlier in the movie. The movie ends with everyone celebrating their victory, and the oceans are now safe."
Ocean's Eight,2018,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5164214/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Debbie Ocean gathers an all-female crew to attempt an impossible heist at New York City's annual Met Gala. Following her release from prison, Debbie Ocean, younger sister of the late Danny Ocean, meets with her former partner-in-crime Lou to convince her to join a heist that she planned while serving her sentence. Debbie and Lou assemble the rest of their team: Rose Weil, a disgraced fashion designer who is deeply in debt with the IRS; Amita, a jewelry maker and friend of Debbie's who is eager to move out of her mother's house and start her own life; Nine Ball, a computer hacker; Constance, a street hustler and pickpocket; and Tammy, a profiteer and another friend of Debbie's who has been secretly selling stolen goods out of her family's suburban home. Debbie plans to steal the Toussaint, a $150 million Cartier necklace, from the Met Gala in three-and-a-half weeks, and use Met Gala co-host Daphne Kluger, a famous actress known for her long neck, as an unwitting mule who will wear the necklace into the gala.—mediaknite Having all the time in the world to iron out the details of her ambitious next project, charismatic con artist Debbie Ocean, Danny Ocean's younger sister, contacts her former accomplice Lou to lend her a hand. And after serving a five-year stint in jail, Debbie picks up where she left off and assembles an all-female dream team of experts to pull off her $150-million magnum opus: steal Cartier's radiant Toussaint diamond necklace adorning the swanlike neck of the renowned actress, Daphne Kluger. But in the upcoming Met Gala, all eyes will be on Daphne and her exquisite necklace. How on earth will Ocean's Eight manage to snatch it in plain sight?—Nick Riganas The film starts with Debbie Ocean (Sandra Bullock) attending a parole hearing. She has spent the last five years in prison, and her infamous brother Danny has recently died. Debbie says she feels she is more than ready to rejoin society and continue to live a simple life.The first thing Debbie does upon being released is go to a department store in New York City and pinch several items after pretending that she was there to return them. She then stays at a hotel after pretending to be part of a couple that just checked out.On her next stops, Debbie visits Danny's tomb where Reuben Tishkoff (Elliott Gould) appears to tell Debbie that she doesn't have to do whatever it is that she is planning to do next. Debbie also goes to find her ex-boyfriend Claude Becker (Richard Armitage), an art dealer who also snitched on her and caused her to get sent to jail. She finds him at an art gallery and intimidates him with a shiv made from a toothbrush, but she only takes a button off his shirt.Debbie reunites with her former partner-in-crime Lou (Cate Blanchett), who works at a bar where she and her cohorts are watering down vodka. Debbie lets Lou in on a new scheme of hers that she needs Lou's help on. They take a visit to The Metropolitan Museum of Art where the upcoming Met Gala is about to be held, and Debbie is planning a heist. At the same time, Lou allows Debbie to stay with her.The plan is to steal a valuable diamond necklace, the Toussaint, which is worth $150 million. Debbie wants to use snobby socialite Daphne Kluger (Anne Hathaway) as the mule so she can wear it to the Met Gala where it can be taken. First, Debbie needs to assemble a crew in order to pull this off.Debbie and Lou go to find Rose Weil (Helena Bonham Carter), a local fashion designer whose work isn't nearly as regarded as it was back then. The two find Rose crying and eating Nutella where they propose the idea to her so that she can earn herself some money.Debbie then reunites with another old friend, Amita (Mindy Kaling), an Indian jewelry maker who works and lives with her mother. She immediately joins Debbie when she tells her she won't have to live with her mom after this.Next, Lou introduces Debbie to a computer hacker who calls herself Nine Ball (Rihanna) and shows how good she is by hacking into the building's power line.Debbie and Lou then find a street hustler named Constance Wong (Awkwafina), who is a pro at pick pocketing.Finally, Debbie calls another old friend, Tammy (Sarah Paulson), who is enjoying a life with her family in suburbia, but Debbie notices that a lot of things in Tammy's garage are stolen goods. Tammy joins as well.The seven women meet at Lou's loft where Debbie divulges the plan to the ladies and how they plan to infiltrate the Met Gala in order to secure the necklace, and so that each of them will have $16.5 million within three weeks.First, the ladies have Rose meet at a local restaurant with a celebrity named Penelope Stern (Dakota Fanning) to potentially dress her for the Gala. When Daphne sees them meeting in the tabloids, she sets up her own meeting with Rose so that she can dress her instead. Then, they arrange for Rose and Amita to see the Toussaint so that the necklace's owners may be persuaded to let Daphne wear it for the Gala. The ladies give Rose special glasses to wear so it can scan the necklace and send it to a 3D printer that will print a replica of the necklace made out of zirconium, which they will switch for the real necklace. When Daphne does get to wear the necklace, Rose discovers that the necklace can only be removed using a special magnet. Nine calls her sister, who knows what to use in order to remove the necklace without that particular magnet.The crew then gets themselves into the event as part of the staff, with Tammy being hired as a coordinator. She gets Constance, Amita, and Lou in as part of the kitchen staff. Nine Ball hacks into the computer of someone working the event to get a view of the seating arrangements for the event. Debbie plans to have Claude meet Daphne so that he can be her date. Lou then realizes Debbie is planning to frame Claude as a revenge scheme. A flashback shows ten years earlier when Debbie first met Claude, and they hit it off. He got her involved in a fraud scheme, and his testimony against her was what got her locked up. Debbie tries to assure Lou that the job is strictly to get the necklace.The night of the Met Gala arrives. Celebrities like Kim Kardashian, Gigi Hadid, Heidi Klum, Common, Serena Williams, and Katie Holmes (all appearing as themselves) are in attendance. The crew gets into positions, with Debbie posing as a German socialite with dyed-blonde hair and using her skilled knowledge of the German language. Daphne shows up with Claude as her date after Debbie had it made so that they could meet and hit it off. Lou adds something to Daphne's soup that causes her to run to the bathroom to start vomiting. Constance manages to swipe the necklace off her as her head is in the toilet. She passes the necklace to Amita, who goes to a staff bathroom to start splitting the diamonds off the necklace. After Daphne leaves the bathroom, her bodyguards notice that the necklace is missing. They lock the place down as they go searching for it. Before Amita can be found by a guard, Tammy pulls out the zirconium fake necklace and hands it over. Constance then gets the diamonds and hands the individual pieces to the rest of the crew before they disappear out the exits.Soon the next day, the fake necklace is discovered. An insurance fraud investigator named John Frazier (James Corden) gets on the case, as he knows about Debbie and her family's history, as well as the fact that she was spotted at the event. Frazier speaks to Claude, Daphne's guards, and the Gala's staff as they are suspects. He then talks to Daphne and even Debbie herself, to which she all but confirms that it was a revenge scheme.The ladies are at their hideout when Daphne enters. Debbie and Lou revealed they called her in because she was starting to catch on to their scheme since Rose was recording the day they found out about the magnet. Daphne is actually eager to join since she doesn't have many female friends and she finds this to be exciting. Daphne later plants evidence of some of the diamonds in Claude's apartment, which is made worse for him when four elderly women have also had valuables of their placed in his possession. Claude is sent to jail.The crew celebrates their success, but Daphne points out that stealing the one necklace and splitting it eight ways didn't sound like a great plan. That's when Debbie reveals that they stole ALL the necklaces from the Gala during the lock-down. Lou had help from The Amazing Yen (Shaobo Qin), who easily made his way through the laser detectors and helped Lou secure the items.With all the money they want, the ladies split off to do whatever they want:Amita moves to Paris with a new boyfriend.Rose opens up her own dress shop.Constance gets her own place in the city.Tammy opens and operates a warehouse with more stolen goods.Nine Ball continues her hacker work.Daphne becomes a film director (and even directs Anne Hathaway).Lou gets herself a motorcycle and goes on a cross country road trip by herself.In the final scene, Debbie goes back to Danny's tomb with a martini to tell him, ""You would have loved it."""
Ready Player One,2018,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1677720/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"When the creator of a virtual reality called the OASIS dies, he makes a posthumous challenge to all OASIS users to find his Easter Egg, which will give the finder his fortune and control of his world. In the year 2045, the real world is a harsh place. The only time Wade Watts (Tye Sheridan) truly feels alive is when he escapes to the OASIS, an immersive virtual universe where most of humanity spends their days. In the OASIS, you can go anywhere, do anything, be anyone--the only limits are your own imagination. The OASIS was created by the brilliant and eccentric James Halliday (Mark Rylance), who left his immense fortune and total control of the Oasis to the winner of a three-part contest he designed to find a worthy heir. When Wade conquers the first challenge of the reality-bending treasure hunt, he and his friends--The High Five--are hurled into a fantastical universe of discovery and danger to save the OASIS.—Warner Bros. In the year 2045, on his deathbed James Halliday, the creator of a wildly-popular virtual reality utopia known as the OASIS, begins a hunt for his fortune and ownership of the whole VRMMO world with puzzles and riddles based on Halliday's obsession with pop culture of decades past. After years of searching for Halliday's ""Easter Egg,"" one average teenager named Wade Watts solves the first clue, sparking excitement and hope back to the hunt, and throwing him into a world of people willing to kill for the information he has, changing his life forever.—ahmetkozan In a not-so-distant and gloomy 2045, the late James Halliday's parallel virtual universe euphemistically called the ""Oasis"", alleviates the burden of a depressing daily life, with millions of online users preferring the vast and colourful cyberworld over their dystopian reality. As anyone can be anything he desires within the Oasis, the dedicated gamer, Wade Watts--or, better yet, Parzival, after his avatar--is obsessed with finding an elusive Easter Egg hidden meticulously inside the code, to inherit not only an immense fortune but also the game's total control. Three trials, three keys, a cut-throat competition, and an army of professional no-joke players who only want the same thing. Can Wade pull off a surprising victory?—Nick Riganas In 2045, people seek regular escape from life through the virtual reality entertainment universe OASIS, co-created by James Halliday and Ogden Morrow of Gregarious Games. After Halliday's death, a recorded message left by his avatar Anorak announces a game, granting ownership of OASIS to the first to find the Golden Easter egg within it, which is locked behind a gate requiring three keys. The contest has lured a number of 'gunters', or egg hunters, and the interest of Nolan Sorrento, the CEO of Innovative Online Industries (IOI) who seeks to control OASIS himself. IOI uses a number of indentured servants and employees called ""Sixers"" to find the egg. We open in a place called ""The Stacks"", in Columbus Ohio, in the year 2045.The-low-income community is filled with a number of precariously stacked trailers and vehicles, where Wade Watts (Tye Sheridan) lives with his Aunt Alice (Susan Lynch), and her boyfriend Rick (Ralph Ineson).With the real world in such an impoverished state and no one really caring to do anything about it, Wade finds himself like millions of people, escaping into The OASIS (Ontologically Anthropocentric Sensory Immersive Simulation), a virtual reality world where people can enter as avatars to play video games, entertain themselves, and seek pleasures they can't find so easily in the real world.Created by James Halliday (Mark Rylance) and Ogden Morrow (Simon Pegg) of Gregarious Games, The OASIS is a place where one can do anything and be anyone (or anything). However, like a video game, if you accumulate stuff in THE OASIS and your avatar dies, you end up losing everything. Wade's avatar in this world is named Parzival, and he frequently interacts with Aech (Lena Waithe), a huge muscular mechanic, as well as the samurai Daito (Win Morisaki) and fighter Sho (Philip Zhao), although he has never met any of them in person.One of Wade's hobbies, is trying to decipher a contest that James Halliday created before he died. After his death, a video was sent out, telling how he had hidden an Easter egg within the Oasis. There would be three challenges to win (presided over by Halliday's avatar, Anorak the all-knowing), each one having a specific key. Whomever gets all three keys and receives the egg, would inherit Halliday's personal fortune of $500 billion, and gain total control over THE OASIS.While many egg hunters (nicknamed ""Gunters"") have teamed up to search, Wade mostly searches on his own. Their main competition comes from Gregarious Games' main competition: IOI (Innovative Online Industries). Though mostly making their money off of products and other gear to allow one into THE OASIS, the company's CEO Nolan Sorrento (Ben Mendelsohn) wants to find the egg to increase the amount of influence and money IOI can make from the virtual world.A number of persons eagerly searched for the keys, but in five years, the only thing uncovered was the first challenge: a racing game through a simulated New York City. Wade and Aech attempt go on another race through the event, but like always, no one can get past King Kong near the end of the challenge. During the race Wade is also entranced by a female racer on a bike from the film ""Akira."" He soon finds out that this is Art3mis (Olivia Cooke), a well-known gamer and ""sixer-fixer.""Wade convinces Aech to help Art3mis repair her bike after the race. In Aech's garage, Wade and Art3mis discuss Halliday and his challenge. While Wade claims he'd use the money to buy things, Artemis claims he's really afraid to 'zero-out' and lose all his stuff.Art3mis' words stick in Wade's head, and then goes to the Halliday Journals, a place in THE OASIS that is like a personal shrine to Halliday. With assistance from a mechanical Curator (Simon Pegg), Wade observes a memory in which Halliday and Morrow have a discussion about the future of their creation. Halliday claims he hates rules, and wishes they could ""just go backwards.""The next time Wade enters the first challenge, he throttles his Delorean Time Machine vehicle backwards, and uncovers a secret roadway, that leads him underneath the challenge, past Kong, and to Central Park. He then meets Anorak, who rewards him with the Copper Key, 100,000 coins, and a clue. Wade takes his newfound winnings, and goes on a shopping spree, before telling of the challenge's secret to Art3mis, Aech, Daito, and Sho.In his spare time, Wade ponders the clue about ""a creator who hates his own creation"" and ""a leap not taken,"" but draws a blank.At IOI, a number of board members explain to Sorrento their worry now that Parzival's name is on the board. However, the businessman is fairly certain there is nothing to worry about, in their quest to get more money from THE OASIS. Even so, Sorrento goes into THE OASIS, where he meets up with a bounty hunter called I-R0k (T.J. Miller). After collecting a powerful item called the Orb of Osuvox from him, Sorrento then hires I-ROk to take out Parzival.Wade's next visit to the Halliday Journals has him mobbed by a number of fans, until Art3mis shows up, and helps disguise him. The two then go into the Journals, and view a recording of a meeting between Halliday and Morrow before THE OASIS went live. In the memory, Halliday tells how he took a woman named Karen Underwood (Perdita Weeks) on a date, but while she wanted to go dancing, he took her to a movie instead. Kira eventually married Morrow, though Wade notes that even though she seemed to be important to both their lives, this is the only mention of her name he's found in the Journals.The Curator debates this, but finds the analysis to be true. Wade is rewarded with a quarter, and an invitation by Art3mis to go to The Distracted Globe, a special club that was designed by Halliday.While Wade is excited to hang out with Art3mis, Aech cautions him that she may be using him, or that Art3mis could be ""a dude.""At the Distracted Globe, Art3mis leads Wade out onto a zero-g dance floor, thinking ""the leap not taken"" may be tied to having the Copper Key, AND leaping into the void. This doesn't work, but during the time in zero-g, Wade begins to confess his feelings to Art3mis, eventually even telling her his real name (which happens to be overheard by i-R0k!).Before the bounty hunter can strike, IOI crashes the party, attempting to assassinate Wade. He and Art3mis manage to escape, but almost at the cost of their own lives. Art3mis confesses how her father died in an IOI ""Loyalty Center,"" trying to pay off debt, and that she can't afford to be distracted from trying to find the egg, and possibly stopping further harm happening to others.i-R0k does more research, and soon gives Sorrento Wade's full information. Per the IOI Board of Directors, Sorrento has wade's avatar piped into his office. Sorrento offers Wade plenty of things, including a$25 million bonus if he helps the company find the egg. However, Wade isn't swayed by the offers, and declines...but not before Sorrento confesses that he knows where Wade lives, and is going to destroy his home!Wade rushes out of his secret hiding place to warn his Aunt and her boyfriend, but is too late, as the stack their home is atop explodes, and crashes to the ground! Wade next tries to contact his friends, but is knocked out by an unknown man with a face tattoo.When he awakens, Wade finds himself face-to-face with Art3mis, whose real name is Samantha Cook. She and several others are headquartered not far from The Stacks and IOI. While she seems upset about a large birthmark on her face, Wade tells her that he doesn't care about it. As they talk in private, Samantha suddenly thinks she may know what the first challenge's clue meant!Getting their friends together, the group head back to the Journals, and inquire about the films that Halliday might have taken Kira to on her date. One that stands out to Wade is ""The Shining."" Much like the clue, it's creator (author Stephen King) hated it's creation.The group go into the film's Overlook Hotel, courtesy of the Curator. Aech braves a number of terrifying scenarios, but they question their first assumption that a particular key in the film may be what they are looking for, when they hear music coming from one of the rooms. It is here they encounter Kira, dancing with a number of zombies over a large pit.Art3mis then realizes ""the leap not taken,"" was Halliday talking about not taking the step to be with Kira! Eventually, she makes her way through the zombies, and asks Kira to dance. This reveals Anorak, who then offers her The Jade Key, and the next clue.The rest of the group (dubbing themselves ""the High Five"") soon get their own Jade Key, before being followed in by a hoard of Sixers, who then are set upon by the terrors of ""The Shining.""This latest revelation also reveals to Sorrento that Wade is still alive. Sending out his associate F'Nale Zandor (Hannah John-Kamen) to try and track down the group. She eventually finds one of Samantha's associates, and trails him to her secret hideout!Wade attempts to get Samantha to escape with him, but she sacrifices herself so he can get away, and alerts their friends to help him. F'Nale then confronts Samantha, and claims that IOI is now in possession of her ""outstnding debts,"" earning her a ticket to the one place the girl fears most: IOI's Loyalty Centers.Meanwhile, Wade has been found and picked up by his friends. Aech (whose real name is Helen) helps him escape in a modified postal truck, where he meets Daito (real name Toshiro), and Sho (named Shoto).During this time, IOI cracked the third challenge, and determined it leads to Castle Anorak, on Planet Doom in THE OASIS. It is here the final challenge is revealed: an Atari 2600 with every game ever made for the console...but only one will unlock the final key.Sorrento then has the Orb of Osuvox activated, shielding the castle from anyone getting in, while a number of Loyalty Center employees (including Samanta), set explosive charges outside the front entrance of the place.To save Samantha, Wade tells Aech what he recalls of Sorrento's office, and they create a digital-double of the place, hijacking his online feed before he can return to the real world! Sorrento gives the group information on Samantha's workstation, and they manage to get her out. However, knowing what IOI has done to the castle, she stays in the facility, and tries to find a way to undo the orb.Wade and his friends then broadcast a message across the Oasis, telling of what Sorrento has done, and requesting those who believe in what's right, come to Planet Doom to help them. This leads to a massive group of persons doing battle against IOI forces, as Samantha manages to bring the orb's protection down.Getting outside, she manages to meet up with Wade, but not before Sorrento unleashes his Mecha-Godzilla armored suit against the. Aech uses her Iron Giant persona and Daito gains control of a Gundam suit for 60 seconds, but both fail to make a dent in the massive creature. However, Samantha manages to use a Madball/bomb thrown into the head, to take down Sorrento.Sorrento then goes on a mad rampage through hi facility, certain that Samantha is there. To save her, Wade kills her character in THE OASIS, and she escapes outside, soon encountering the others.Back in the game, Wade and Sho manage to make it to the final challenge. As they watch one Sixer play the game ""Adventure,"" he wins...but then falls through some ice!Wade claims he knows how to get the final key, when Sorrento and i-R0k show up. Sorrento makes one more offer to Wade, but threatens to unleash a weapon called ""The Cataclysm,"" that will wipe out every avatar on Planet Doom! Wade attempts to stop the madman, but he sets off the device!In the aftermath, Wade finds out he is still alive. Apparently, the quarter the Curator gave him, was an Extra Life token! Wade then begins to play Adventure, and THE OASIS then begins to broadcast what he's doing. Wade explains that the goal of the final challenge, is to find the hidden Easter egg in the game (which some consider to be one of the first in video game history!).This reveals Anorak, and the final Crystal Key. It is at this point that IOI and their forces have found Aech and her truck. Wade calls out to anyone in the area to meet them at The Stacks.In THE OASIS, he manages to unlock a large door with his keys, and is then given papers to sign...but hesitates. Wade claims this is similar to when Halliday made Morrow sign over his shares of the company. When Wade refuses to sign, Anorak becomes Halliday, and the chamber becomes Halliday's childhood room.The room contains a special button, that if pressed, will erase the entire OASIS. Halliday also gives Wade the Easter egg, while telling him that while the virtual world can be good from time-to-time, the real world, and interacting with real people, is just as important.The group makes it to The Stacks, but not before Sorrento knocks them off-balance. He almost kills them, when he sees the glint of the Easter egg in Wade's VR goggles. It is at this time that the Police arrive, and arrest Sorrento and F'Nale.Shortly after this Ogden Morrow shows up, along with some lawyers from Gregarious Games, wanting Wade's signature. However, he claims he wants to split the prize with his friends.Ogden also reveals that he was the Curator, and commends Wade for his detective work.In the aftermath of the contest, Ogden comes to work with them in overseeing THE OASIS (his fee: twenty-five cents). They also ban any Loyalty Centers from doing business in THE OASIS, and IOI is forced to shut them all down.Taking Halliday's advice to experience the real world, the group also shuts THE OASIS off on Tuesdays and Thursdays."

Optimus Prime (voice of Peter Cullen) blasts away foes as he calls in assistance from B-127 (voice of Dylan O'Brien). The small Autobot comes in beating the Decepticons until Optimus tasks him with a mission. They head toward a launch pad so that Optimus can send B-127 to planet Earth for refuge and to help establish a base for the Autobots. The Decepticons rush over to destroy the launch pad, but B-127 makes it off Cybertron in time while Optimus stays to keep fighting.The year is 1987 in the California town of Brighton Falls. Charleen 'Charlie' Watson (Hailee Steinfeld) wakes up and goes to meet her family; her mother Sally (Pamela Adlon), brother Otis (Jason Drucker), and stepfather Ron (Stephen Schneider). Charlie hasn't gotten over the passing of her father and has not fully accepted Ron as part of the family. She then goes to work at a carnival where her co-worker Memo (Jorge Lindeborg, Jr.) tries to get her attention because he has a crush on her, but she just ignores him. Charlie then accidentally spills lemonade on a guy from school and is mocked by the popular girls led by Tina (Gracie Dzienny). Later at home, Charlie tries to fix up a car that she had been working on with her father, but she becomes discouraged and feels that she can't do it on her own.We cut to a training exercise involving paint balls between Sector 7 agents. Agent Jack Burns (John Cena) boasts his win to his peers, just moments before they see B-127 come crashing down to the ground. As he rises to his feet, the agents go after the Autobot and chase him until he's cornered. B-127 speaks and says he doesn't want to hurt the agents. However, a real threat arrives in the form of Blitzwing (voice of David Sobolov), who fires upon the agents before chasing after B-127. Blitzwing catches him and demands that he give up the whereabouts of Optimus and the other Autobots. B-127 says he'll never talk, so Blitzwing makes it official by ripping out his voice box and then dropping him down the side of a cliff. He then tries to kill B-127, but the little guy manages to throw a grenade at Blitzwing and use his blaster to obliterate the Decepticon. B-127 grows weaker as his systems start to shut down and his memory core starts failing. He then scans a Volkswagen Beetle before shutting down.Charlie goes by her Uncle Hank's (Len Cariou) garage to help out, when she spots a yellow Beetle. Since it's her birthday, she asks for the car. When Hank won't budge, Charlie offers to work at the garage for a year, but Hanks relents and lets her take it home. Charlie drives the car home and hides it from her mom in the garage. She notices something fall from her the car, so she looks underneath and sees B-127's face. He reacts quick and takes on his Autobot form. Charlie lets him know she is not going to hurt him, and he appears to trust her. Since he can't talk anymore, he makes a buzzing sound, which Charlie says sounds like a bumblebee, so she decides that his name will now be Bumblebee. However, Charlie activating Bumblebee also causes a signal to go out across the galaxy. Two Decepticons, Shatter (voice of Angela Bassett) and Dropkick (voice of Justin Theroux), are interrogating the Autobot Cliffjumper (voice of Andrew Morgado) on Optimus's whereabouts until they get a read on Bee's signal. Dropkick slices Cliffjumper down the middle as he follows Shatter to Earth.Elsewhere, a redneck couple, Roy (Lenny Jacobson) and Amber (Megyn Price), argue because Roy spent the rent money on a new car. They look up in the sky to see a falling object, and Roy tries to protect his car, but the object hits a truck. A second falling object comes down and not only destroys Roy's car, but the gas station behind it. Shatter and Dropkick then emerge from the craters and stand before the couple. Dropkick liquidates Roy before the two head off on their mission.In the morning, Charlie goes to the garage to greet Bumblebee, but finds that he's gone. She freaks out and asks Otis if someone took the car, and he says that Sally took it to take their dog Conan to the vet. Charlie rides her bike and chases after her mom as Bumblebee sticks his arm out, and she orders him to stop. Charlie manages to stop Sally and makes up an excuse so that she can drive the car.At Sector 7 HQ, a young Agent Simmons (Nick Pilla) brings information to Burns on energy readings that just came in. Burns leads other agents, plus Dr. Powell (John Ortiz), to a site where they meet Shatter and Dropkick. Shatter tells the agents that they are there for Bumblebee, claiming he is a fugitive and that he must be captured. Against Burns's better judgment, the agents agree to help the Decepticons track Bumblebee down.Charlie takes Bee to the beach so that she can let him know that he has to maintain his disguise around anybody who isn't her. She takes him into the woods to try and fix something inside him, and she ends up activating a message from Optimus, which is to remind Bee to aid in bringing the Autobots to Earth, as well of the ongoing Cybertronian civil war. It triggers a flashback in Bee for when he was escaping Cybertron as he watched Optimus fight off Shockwave, Soundwave, and Ravage.Charlie brings Bee home so that she can help him communicate through his radio. She tries a few tapes, like The Smiths and Rick Astley, but Bee rejects them. Outside, Memo tries to knock on Charlie's door to finally talk to her, but he ends up seeing Bumblebee as an Autobot, and it doesn't help when he transforms into a Volkswagon car right in front of him. Charlie tells Memo not to freak out, and she makes him promise to keep this knowledge between the two of them.The Sector 7 agents allow Shatter and Dropkick to access their technology and create a connected web of information with their own advanced gear. Burns rightfully doesn't trust the Decepticons, and his commanding officer allows him to do what he wants with the bots once they have found and captured Bumblebee.Charlie goes ahead to work on the other car while Bee watches ""The Breakfast Club"" and becomes amused by the famous fist pump shot. He goes for another tape, but he grabs a tape labled ""Charlie's Dive Meet"". Charlie gets upset and turns it off because that was the last time she saw her father, as he was the one recording it. She tells Bee that he died of a heart attack and that she never got to say goodbye, and she thinks that fixing the car will be like preserving a piece of him, but she can't fix it and feels helpless. Charlie breaks down as Bee comforts her.Later on, Memo joins Charlie and Bee as they head out for the day. They go by a cliff-side where Charlie's classmates are hanging out. The guy who she spilled lemonade on recognizes her, but instead for knowing her as a diver. He challenges Charlie to jump off the cliff and into the water, but as Charlie gets ready to do so, she backs out, as she is reminded too much of her father. Tina goes to her car to taunt her and cruelly bring up Charlie's father. Memo then proposes they get revenge. Later that night, they go by Tina's house to throw toilet paper all over it. They show Bee how to get in on it, but he just throws all the rolls over the house. They then get some eggs to pelt Tina's car with. Bee manages to throw all the eggs onto the car, but he gets carried away and then proceeds to stomp on Tina's car and completely wreck it. Charlie and Memo hop inside Bee before Tina comes outside to see that her car is now a pancake.While Charlie is at work, Bee follows Conan through the doggy door. He ends up inside the house, making a huge mess of things before sticking his finger in an electrical socket, which causes a shortage that blows up the transformers outside. This also sends out an Energon signal that Shatter and Dropkick pick up, which alerts the Sector 7 agents to Bee's whereabouts. Memo sees the chaos outside and calls Charlie, urging her to come home. She does so and sees the mess that Bee made, and she scolds him, scaring him but apologizes. Sally later comes home to find the place a mess and she begins to chastise Charlie for whatever happened, thinking she is acting out. Charlie hits back that she hasn't been able to find happiness and move on since her dad died unlike Sally.Charlie leaves with Bee and Memo. They are discovered by the agents and are promptly pursued. Bee tries to protect Charlie, but he gets tased, and so does she. Bee is taken into Sector 7, leading Charlie and Memo to go rescue him. Shatter and Dropkick pick at Bee's body until they find the message from Optimus. Once they realize that the Autobots are coming to Earth, they decide to contact the other Decepticons to also come to the planet so they can kill their enemies, along with the humans. Dr. Powell overhears them and tries to warn Burns, just before Dropkick liquidates Powell as well. The Decepticons appear to kill Bumblebee as well before they head off to make contact. Charlie and Memo run to Bee and grab electric guns to try and give him electricity to bring him back. It appears to not work at first, but Bee rises up and Charlie hugs him. The electric shocks also bring back all of Bee's memories.The three step outside, only to be confronted by the agents. Burns orders them to fire on Bee to restrain him. When he sees that Charlie is in danger, Bee musters up his strength to fight back against the agents. He ends up becoming fueled with rage as he fires back on the agents, severely injuring them until Charlie tells Bee to stop because she knows he is not a killer. Bee backs down and takes Charlie with him to go stop the Decepticons. Memo tries to join her, but she tells him to stay behind, and she leaves him with a kiss on the cheek.Otis is forced to tell Sally where Charlie is, so she has Ron drive out to find her. They end up in a chase alongside Bee and Charlie as they are pursued by more agents. Bee and Charlie manage to get away while Ron narrowly avoids crashing and getting struck by the other oncoming cars. Otis finds the whole near-death experience awesome until he pukes.Shatter and Dropkick prepare to use a device on a tower to send out a call to the Decepticons. Charlie heads up the tower to remove the device while Bee fights Dropkick. The Decepticon uses his weaponry against Bee, but the Autobot grabs a chain and wraps it around Dropkick. With one swift pull, Bee tears Dropkick to pieces. Shatter then tries to kill Charlie, but Bee swoops in to save her. Burns also attempts to fly in with his helicopter during the chaos, but is attacked by Shatter. Before he crashes, Bee catches and saves Burns. He continues to fight Shatter as Charlie pulls off the device from the tower. Just when it looks like Shatter has the upper hand, Bee fires a blast that breaks a dam. Bee grabs Shatter and holds her as a ship crashes into them, destroying Shatter and sending Bee to the bottom of the water. Charlie dives in and helps him out. Burns finds them and allows them to leave, now having respect for Bumblebee.Charlie brings Bee just outside of San Francisco to part ways, knowing that Bee's fellow Autobots need him just as Charlie has people there that need her. She tearfully says goodbye to Bee, and he hugs her back. He then scans a Camaro and takes that form before he heads off. Charlie returns home where a crowd is gathered after the events that happened. She reunites with her family, hugging Sally, sincerely thanking Otis for letting his parents know where she was, and showing Ron some respect. Memo then joins her and tries to hold her hand, but she tells him they're not quite there yet.Optimus meets Bumblebee on Earth where he tells his leader his new name as they await the arrival of the other Autobots. Meanwhile, Charlie finally fixes up her dad's car and takes it out for a spin."

The Nun,2018,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5814060/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A priest with a haunted past and a novice on the threshold of her final vows are sent by the Vatican to investigate the death of a young nun in Romania and confront a malevolent force in the form of a demonic nun. When a young nun at a cloistered abbey in Romania takes her own life, a priest with a haunted past and a novitiate on the threshold of her final vows are sent by the Vatican to investigate. Together they uncover the order's unholy secret. Risking not only their lives but their faith and their very souls, they confront a malevolent force in the form of the same demonic nun that first terrorized audiences in 'The Conjuring 2,' as the abbey becomes a horrific battleground between the living and the damned.—Warner Bros. Romania, 1952. To shed light on Sister Victoria's puzzling suicide case, troubled exorcist Father Burke and his idealistic assistant, novice nun Sister Irene, visit Saint Cartha's monastery. But some doors are best left closed. As blood-chilling supernatural encounters place the unsuspecting investigators in harm's way, the ancient secret behind the abbey's thick stone walls will resurface. But confronted with the sinister force exposed inThe Conjuring 2 (2016), their lives are at stake. Repentance is futile. Can the defenders of virtue face the unforgiving embodiment of true evil?—Nick Riganas Set in the year 1952 at the Carta Monastery in Romania, two nuns are going down to a dark hall toward a door that reads ""God ends here"". The older nun goes through the door to find some kind of artifact, while the younger nun, Sister Victoria (Charlotte Hope) starts to pray. The older nun emerges attacked and bloodied, telling Victoria to run before she is pulled back into the darkness. Victoria runs toward a window as the attacker while clutching a key, the demon nun Valak (Bonnie Aarons), moves slowly but closer toward her. Victoria asks God for forgiveness before she jumps and hangs herself. Sometime later, her decaying body is discovered by a man simply known as Frenchie (Jonas Bloquet).The officials at the Vatican learn of Victoria's suicide, which is considered the ultimate sin. They enlist Father Anthony Burke (Demian Bichir) to investigate. He seeks out a young novitiate named Sister Irene (Taissa Farmiga), who currently acts as a teacher to young girls. The two get together and go to find Frenchie so he can take them to where he found Victoria's body.The three go to the abbey where Frenchie leads Burke and Irene to the ice box where he left Victoria's body. Frenchie points out that Victoria is sitting up when he left her body lying down. Burke pries Victoria's fingers open and finds the key in her hand. They then take her body to give her a proper burial. While walking back toward the abbey, Burke notices fresh blood on the steps where Frenchie found Victoria's body. They then go into the chapel but cannot enter the abbey yet. They meet the Abbess (Gabrielle Downey), who informs them that are engaging in a vow of silence for Victoria, and that they may enter the next day.Burke and Irene go to their rooms while Frenchie leaves. He walks past the dark woods and sees what looks like Victoria walking through the woods. He follows her and ends up attacked by a demon nun. Frenchie picks up a cross from the ground and walks away with it.Irene tells Burke about a series of visions she experienced as a child, all of which ended with her hearing the phrase ""Mary points the way"". Burke then recalls an incident in France in which he was summoned to exorcise a young boy named Daniel (August Maturo) that had been possessed. Despite Burke's efforts, the boy sustained fatal injuries from the exorcism, and Burke has been wracked with guilt ever since.Later that night, Burke is awoken by the sound of music. He goes out into the woods and sees what looks like a demonic version of Daniel. The vision comes to life and pushes Burke into a coffin before an unholy force buries him alive, leaving him with a bell to ring. Irene also wakes up and wanders the chapel before she sees Valak in the mirror trying to attack her. She runs outside and hears Burke ringing the bell. Soon, multiple bells around graves start to ring, but Irene manages to find Burke's coffin and she starts to dig him up. Before she can reach him, demon hands start to pull at him, but Irene manages to free him. Inside the coffin, Burke then finds a bunch of books on the occult.The next day, Burke and Irene go to the abbey, but only Irene is allowed to enter. She meets Sister Oana (Ingrid Bisu), who tells her that the nuns change shifts to pray to keep evil at bay. Oana hears about Irene seeing Valak, and Oana explains the demon's origin. When the abbey was built during the Dark Ages, a duke obsessed with the powers of Hell tried to open a rift to summon Valak, but several men found and killed the duke before Valak could fully emerge, keeping him trapped using an artifact (the same one the nuns from before were looking for) containing the blood of Christ. He remained sealed in Hell until bombs from World War II dropped around the abbey and broke the rift open, setting the demon loose. Oana explains that Valak takes the form of a nun to look like the rest of them and prey on their weaknesses. Meanwhile, Burke reads about Valak and learns his name.Frenchie is in a tavern where he hears that one of the patrons had a 12-year-old daughter that committed suicide by hanging after allegedly seeing something horrible. After Frenchie tells the bartender that he went up with Burke and Irene to the abbey, the bartender warns Frenchie that the two of them may be the next victims.Burke once again attempts to enter the abbey, only to encounter the Abbess again to tell him he won't find another way in. He tries to ask the Abbess about the key that he found with Victoria, but she tells Burke it's too late and that Irene is lost. Her body then appears to go limp. Burke tries to lift her veil to see her, but her demonic body grabs at him until he rips her hand off of him.Irene awakens after seeing another frightening vision of Valak. She wanders outside her room and is once again attacked by the demon nun. Burke hears the noise and tries to save her but he is also attacked until Frenchie shows up with a shotgun. Irene finds the other nuns and starts to pray alongside them as an evil force carves a pentagram into her back. Irene then sees what looks like Oana's dead body, but she quickly realizes that Oana and the other nuns were not real, but visions.The three reunite as they realize that Victoria was not trying to commit suicide, but rather sacrifice herself so that Valak could not possess her body and spread terror. They head into the catacombs to find the artifact with Christ's blood. Irene realizes that ""Mary points the way"" is in reference to the statue of Mary that literally points the way to where they may find the artifact. Sure enough, they come across the vial containing the blood after opening its chamber using Victoria's key. Soon, Valak reemerges and attacks the trio. He starts to try and possess Irene while Burke is attacked by the demonic Daniel. Irene is briefly possessed, but Frenchie manages to throw some blood on her to free her. Valak unleashes a dark force upon Frenchie, and then tries to drown Irene. He pulls her up and sees that the vial is broken. She spits the blood in Valak's face, sending the demon back to Hell and sealing the rift.As the trio leave the abbey, Irene asks Frenchie his real name, and he says it's Maurice. We then see an upside down cross burned into the back of Maurice's neck.The film concludes with a clip from the first ""Conjuring"" movie in the present day where Carolyn Perron (Lili Taylor) is watching Ed and Lorraine Warren (Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga) give a seminar on their encounter with the possessed Maurice, who later committed suicide. His contact with Lorraine caused her to see visions, and unfortunately for her, it would not be the last time that she encountered Valak."

Jordan) has managed to score seven wins in a row after losing by default to Pretty Ricky Conlan. He is set to go up against Danny ""Stuntman"" Wheeler (Andre Ward) for a Championship match.

Donnie steps into the ring and fights Wheeler whom he defeats, earning the cheers of thousands of fans as well as the WBC World Heavyweight Championship.After the match, Donnie approaches Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) with an engagement ring that he wants to give to Bianca, but isn't quite sure what to say. He asks Rocky what he said to Adrian when he proposed, and Rocky says it was something stupid, but it was his way of saying how much he loved and needed her. He tells Donnie to let his heart do the talking. That night, Donnie tries to propose to Bianca after she gets out of the shower, and he expresses his feelings towards her, but her hearing aid wasn't properly tuned, so she didn't hear anything and just sees Donnie on one knee with the ring. Bianca is overwhelmed initially and isn't sure what to think, but after Donnie assures her how much she means to him, she accepts his proposal.Rocky visits Adrian's grave to talk to her. He mentions that he has not spoken to their son Robert since he left Philadelphia years ago, and hasn't even met his grandson yet.The Dragos arrive in Philly with Buddy backing them. Ivan visits Rocky's restaurant to face his nemesis for the first time in over 30 years. Ivan tells Rocky just how much he lost when Rocky defeated him back then. He not only lost all respect from Russia, but also his wife who left him and Viktor, so this match is especially personal to Ivan. Meanwhile, Donnie and Bianca go out to eat and see a news report on Viktor challenging Donnie for his Championship title. The news people don't fail to mention that Viktor is the son of the man who killed Donnie's father.During one of Bianca's concerts, Buddy approaches Donnie to essentially goad him into fighting Viktor. Afterwards, Donnie goes to talk to Rocky about the match. Knowing all too well how it ended for Apollo when he fought Ivan, Rocky doesn't want to see history repeat itself. He also hates that Donnie has no good reason to enter this fight but anger and hatred. He tries to convince Donnie to rethink his decision to fight Viktor, but Donnie is adamant in going along with it. Rocky decides to sit this one out and refuses to train Donnie for this fight.Donnie and Bianca, now settling in a new apartment in Los Angeles, later go to the home of Mary Anne (Phylicia Rashad) to try and tell her about the fight. When Donnie tries to approach the subject, Mary Anne instinctively guesses that they came to announce that Bianca is pregnant. Although the couple laughs it off, Bianca then goes to take a pregnancy test, which confirms that she is. Donnie then goes to tell Mary Anne about the fight. She is obviously not thrilled to hear that Donnie wants to fight but allows him to with the condition that he does not involve her or Apollo in his reasoning for going through with it.Donnie goes to find Tony ""Little Duke"" Evers (Wood Harris), son of the man who trained Apollo. He asks Little Duke to train him for the upcoming match which Tony agrees to.Soon, a match between Donnie and Viktor is held. Prior to the match, Ivan makes a comment about Apollo that almost sends Donnie into a rage. During the match, Donnie seems confident in himself, managing to get in a few good head shots to Viktor, but Viktor regroups quickly and comes back with some powerful shots of his own. Rocky watches the fight alone in his restaurant. Viktor delivers some hard punches to Donnie's ribs, eventually fracturing them. He lands another brutal shot to the ribs which takes Donnie down to his knees, and then knocks him out with an illegal head shot. Viktor is disqualified for the head shot, while everyone else watches with concern as Donnie's immediate health status is unclear.Donnie survives the fight and spends some time recovering, but his spirit is broken. Rocky tries to visit him at the hospital but quickly realizes he is not welcomed, so he leaves. In the following weeks, Bianca notices how distant Donnie is growing from everybody, especially her. Little Duke later approaches Donnie to tell him that Viktor wants a rematch since Donnie is still the official champion. He also tells him that he can choose not to fight Viktor but he still has to pick an opponent to fight soon, or else he will forfeit the title. Donnie appears disinterested and leaves without answering. Meanwhile, Mary Anne sends a message to Rocky telling him that Donnie needs him, written on the back of a sonogram picture of the upcoming baby. Rocky makes the trip to Los Angeles and surprises Donnie at his mom's house. The two exchange a few barbs and eventually make peace.In Russia, the Dragos are having a celebratory dinner for Viktor's success, which is disrupted when Ivan's ex-wife and Viktor's mother Ludmilla (Brigitte Nielsen) shows up with her new husband out of the blue. Viktor is displeased and walks out, but Ivan follows him and insists that these people are there for them.Eventually, Bianca gives birth to a baby girl that she and Donnie name Amara. The doctors then do a test on Amara to see if she has the same hearing problem as her mother. To their dismay, the doctors determine that Amara is born deaf. Outside, Rocky makes an attempt to call Robert, but then backs out of it.Not long after Amara's birth, Bianca leaves Adonis alone with the baby for one night. The baby starts crying and Donnie finds himself unable to stop it. Out of inspiration, he takes the baby out on a ride that leads them to the gym. The baby quiets down and even smiles at her father when she sees him hitting the punching bag. This inspires Donnie and he later has a serious discussion with Bianca about fighting Viktor one more time. Bianca agrees but make Donnie swear he will get back to his family. She then tells him that he better win. Adonis then meets with Little Duke and Rocky to discuss details and ask Rocky if he'll train him this time. Rocky agrees and orders Little Duke to call the WBC and make it official.Rocky decides to take Donnie to a remote location in the middle of the desert where every gym equipment is made up of rough materials to reinvigorate his spirit and make him accustomed to hellish conditions. They focus a lot on building strength and close combat situations. Meanwhile, Ivan puts Viktor through more intense and harsh training sessions.The night of the rematch comes and takes place in Moscow. The Russian crowd obviously boo Donnie as he enters the arena, but Rocky, Bianca, and Mary Anne are there to support him. As the match begins, Donnie dominates the first round to send a clear message that this fight will not be like the previous one. However, Viktor, again, regroups quickly in the second round and takes the lead with several body shots to Donnie's ribs, and hard shots to the head. Viktor wins the next couple of rounds and sends Donnie to the ground, but Donnie refuses to stay down and keeps getting back to his feet. In their respective corners, Rocky tries to give Donnie cues to take Viktor down, while Ivan tells Viktor to just break Donnie again. Soon, Donnie starts to land more effective blows, even managing to knock Viktor down twice. When it appears that Donnie may be about to claim victory, Ludmilla leaves with her husband. Ivan and Viktor take notice, and Viktor appears to just lose the will to fight. Donnie starts laying in more hits, until Ivan, who can no longer bear to watch, throws in the towel, thereby conceding the fight and allowing Donnie to remain champion. Ivan goes to his son, who brushes him off, thinking he will only give him hell for the loss, but Ivan instead embraces Viktor. In the other corner, Rocky salutes Adonis with a fist bump and tells him ""It's your time now"", before leaving.Rocky finally travels to Chicago to visit Robert (Milo Ventimiglia) and he meets Robert's son Logan (Robbie Johns). Robert introduces Logan to his grandfather and invites him inside. Rocky gives his son a hug.In the final scene, Donnie goes with Bianca to visit Apollo's grave. He makes peace with his father's name and legacy, now that he is in the process of shaping his own. He then introduces Amara to her grandfather."

However, when one of Mr McGregor's relatives inherits the house and goes to check it out, he finds much more than he bargained for. What ensues, is a battle of wills between the new Mr McGregor and the rabbits. But when he starts to fall in love with Bea (Rose Byrne,) a real lover of all nature, his feelings towards them begin to change. But is it too late?—Jude Gordon In England's Lake District, Peter Rabbit, his cousin Benjamin Bunny, and Peter's triplet sisters Flopsy, Mopsy, and Cottontail, spend most of their days picking on Mr. Joe McGregor and stealing vegetables from his garden. They are friends with a local woman named Bea who spends her time painting pictures of the rabbits as well as the surrounding nature. Bea takes on a mother-like relationship with the rabbits due to the death of their parents, who were killed by McGregor. One day, Peter is forced to leave his jacket in McGregor's garden and goes back to retrieve it. McGregor spots and catches him, but suddenly dies of a heart attack due to decades of unhealthy eating habits. Enthralled, Peter invites all of the local animals and takes over McGregor's manor.. Peter Rabbit and his relatives live in the country and spend much of their time trying to steal food from Mr. McGregor's vegetable garden. Then Mr. McGregor dies, and the rabbits, and all the nearby wildlife, have the run of Mr. McGregor's garden and house. This fun and freedom is short-lived, as Mr. McGregor's nephew, Thomas, inherits the property and moves in. He will prove to be as deadly an enemy as his uncle.—grantss The film opens with Peter Rabbit (voice of James Corden) running through the fields where he interacts with all of his woodland friends, including Mr. Jeremy Fisher (voice of Domhnall Gleeson), Pigling Bland (voice of Ewen Leslie), and Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle (voice of Sia), while also evading the hungry Mr. Tod (voice of Fayssal Bazzi). Peter joins his family, cousin Benjamin Bunny (voice of Colin Moody) and Peter's triplet sisters - Flopsy (voice of Margot Robbie), Mopsy (voice of Elizabeth Debicki), and Cotton-Tail (voice of Daisy Ridley) - as they prepare to head into the garden of Mr. McGregor (Sam Neill).The rabbits enter the garden and steal some of McGregor's vegetables before the man spots the rabbits and tries to handle them violently. They are saved by McGregor's neighbor Bea (Rose Byrne), an animal lover and painter. She brings the rabbits into her home where she gives them water with blackberries. Flopsy (being the narrator) mentions that Bea's paintings aren't great, but the drawings she made of the rabbits are actually well done (and in the style of the original books). However, they bring up painful memories, as the drawings reveal that Peter and his sisters lived with their parents until their father went into McGregor's yard and was killed before being made into a pie. Bea looks after the rabbits since their mother is gone too.Peter runs back to McGregor's yard because he left his jacket there, which belonged to his father. He gets it and starts to leave, but McGregor traps Peter and prepares to finish him, until nature finishes McGregor first with a heart attack. After his body is taken away in an ambulance, Peter is ecstatic and invites all the animals to McGregor's house since it is now vacant and they can eat and do whatever they want.In London, McGregor's great-nephew Thomas (Domhnall Gleeson) works at a toy store where he makes sure everything is in tip-top shape and is eagerly awaiting a promotion. He is called in to speak to the store's general manager, who informs him that Mr. McGregor died and his house goes to Thomas, who didn't even know he had a great-uncle. After learning that his sought after promotion has been passed onto another employee, Thomas loses it and starts to wreck the store in a fit of rage before he is fired. However, he later learns that the house can be refurbished and put on the market, so he plans to sell it and build his own toy store to rival the one he previously worked at. He takes a cab to the countryside to find the house.The animals have a party in the McGregor house and make a huge mess before Thomas arrives. Everyone runs and hides, just as Thomas enters and sees the mess. He sits down on the couch and finds Pigling, causing them both to scream and forcing the animals to run out of the house.In the morning, Thomas starts to clean up the house. He then starts to close off any opening into the garden, much to Peter's dismay. Bea walks over to introduce herself and insists to Thomas that he leave the gate open for the rabbits to roam freely. She also gives him a pair of binoculars for bird-watching as a gift. Thomas agrees with her on the gate until she walks away and seals it off completely.Peter recruits Benjamin to join him as they find a way into the garden. Thomas spots them and attempts to catch them. He ends up grabbing Benjamin and stuffs him into a bag. Thomas goes to dispose of him, so Peter and his sisters sneak onto his truck to rescue Benjamin. They succeed and put the binoculars in the bag. Thomas accidentally drops them into the river, forcing him to jump in and retrieve them.Thomas drives into town to find supplies to handle his pest problem. He grabs what he needs and almost hits a snobbish couple on his way out of the hardware store, before running into Bea. He gives her a lift home while the rabbits attempt to ride back on the truck, only to get thrown out when it starts moving too fast. They manage to hop back on, and Peter notices with jealousy that Bea appears to be growing fond of Thomas.Thomas and Bea spend more time together, which upsets Peter because he always saw Bea as a mother figure. Peter enters Bea's painting room while Thomas is there, leading her to think that Peter and Thomas are getting along. When she's gone, the two start fighting until Peter accidentally uses a brush to paint over one of Bea's paintings. She gets upset and makes Peter stay outside.The animals start to get back at Thomas by setting up rabbit traps in his bed as well as planting rakes and hoes for him to step on so that he hurts himself. In turn, Thomas sets up traps around the yard, including an electric fence he smears with peanut butter in case they are tempted. Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle goes for the peanut butter, causing her to get electrocuted (non-fatally) and shoot quills at the other animals. Peter and his sisters retaliate and rewire the electricity so that it shocks Thomas until he passes out in the garden.When Thomas gets up, he sets up dynamite in the rabbits' burrow to get them out. Later on, the rabbits attack Thomas in the garden by pelting him with vegetables until Flopsy gets him in the throat with a blackberry. Luckily, he had an epipen on him. Thomas then grabs several sticks of dynamite and lights them before throwing them at the rabbits. Bea can't hear because she's playing music and painting. Moments later, she steps out because she thinks she hears something. The detonator falls out of Thomas's pocket, and Peter picks it up to prove he was using explosives after he denies it to Bea. Unfortunately, they forgot about all the dynamite in the burrow, which causes the tree on top of it to fall on top of Bea's painting room. She is angry at Thomas for what he's done.Thomas sadly goes back into London and manages to get his job back after putting his house on the market. However, Peter feels terrible for what happened since Bea is upset. When he finds out she plans to leave, Peter and Benjamin head into town with a street mouse they meet and eventually locate Thomas at the toy store. He sees the rabbits and chases them into an employee closet. Peter then starts speaking to Thomas and apologizes for what he did and asks for his help in getting Bea to stay. Thomas decides to form a truce with Peter and he leaves the store for good.After a long journey back to the countryside, Thomas stops Bea just before she leaves in a cab. Thomas apologizes for what he's done and says that Peter helped him get back. Bea doesn't believe him until Peter takes out the detonator from his jacket and hands it to Bea. She forgives him, but Thomas is unable to return home because a couple has bought the house - the same snobby couple he encountered in town at the hardware store. Peter and his friends do what they do best and spring their traps to send the couple running away.In the end, Thomas and Bea get together and head back to London with the rabbits where Bea makes illustrations for children's books, including a few stories on Peter and his friends."

Davis makes it clear that he doesn't trust Kate after what he's learned about her. She explains that while she was working for Energyne, her brother was stricken with cancer, and she hoped that CRISPR might cure him until she learned that Claire had been using CRISPR to develop dangerous weapons. Kate tried to make off with it but was caught and locked up. Davis then tells her how he found George. Poachers got his mother, and a scared young George was hiding under the poachers' truck. Davis and his team recovered him and killed the poachers as they had first shot at them. Russell awakens and is thankful to Davis for saving his life, so he decides to help him and Kate.Davis, Kate, and Russell meet with a military team that is keeping surveillance on George and Ralph as they head into Chicago.

Russell helps Davis and Kate steal a chopper and make their way into the city.George, Ralph, and Lizzie arrive in the city, leading to an all-out RAMPAGE. Davis and Kate arrive as the monsters start tearing the city apart. Knowing there's no way they'll be able to stop them on their own, they head to Energyne to find the antidote that can stop them. Davis lands the chopper, and they run into the building amidst the chaos. They find the lab with the antidote, but the Wydens find them first, and Brett holds them at gunpoint. Claire tells the two that the antidote won't make the animals return to normal, but it will only remove their heightened aggressions. takes the gun and shoots Davis in the abdomen before taking Kate with her.The Wydens attempt to board their own chopper and make off with their materials and Kate, but the monsters start making their way up the tower. George makes it to the top and smashes the chopper, leading Brett to run away. Davis appears after surviving the gunshot and he saves Kate, but Claire is forcing them to help her. Instead, Davis distracts George long enough for Kate to take a vial of the antidote that she recovered and place it in Claire's bag. Kate punches Claire and shoves her into George's path so that he grabs Claire and eats her, along with the antidote.

Following the discovery of a new form of space travel as well as Meg's father's disappearance, she, her brother, and her friend must join three magical beings - Mrs. Whatsit, Mrs. Who, and Mrs. Which - to travel across the universe to rescue him from a terrible evil. 13-year-old middle school student Meg Murry struggles to adjust to both her school and home life ever since her father Alex, a renowned scientist, mysteriously disappeared while he was studying astrophysics when she was very young. Both Meg and her mother Kate believed he solved the question of humanity's existence and theorized that he was into another world. During the night, Meg's younger brother Charles Wallace welcomes Mrs. Whatsit, a red-haired stranger in an extravagant white dress, into the Murry family house. Mrs. Whatsit claims that the Tesseract, a type of space-travel Alex was working on, is real and leaves soon after. The next day, one of Meg's classmates, Calvin O'Keefe, joins them to go to the house of Mrs. Who, another strange woman who speaks only in quotations and seems to know Charles Wallace.. After the disappearance of her father, Meg Murray and her brother Charles Wallace are visited by three mystical beings. They claim to know where her father is, so Meg, Charles Wallace, and her friend go on a journey through time and space to find him. The film opens with a young Meg Murry (Lyric Wilson) with her father Alex (Chris Pine) in their garage as he is building a device. Meg is currently awaiting the arrival of her new little brother. As her mother Kate (Gugu Mbatha-Raw) walks in, Alex talks to Meg about how powerful love is.Years later, Meg (now played by Storm Reid) is 13-years-old, and Alex has been gone for four years, with his disappearance having remained a mystery. Meg goes downstairs to find her younger brother, Charles Wallace (Deric McCabe), in the kitchen. The two of them hear something on the radio about their father and him being missing.At school, the other kids taunt Meg over her father's disappearance, but particularly Veronica Kiley (Rowan Blanchard). During recess, Charles Wallace overhears two teachers talking about Alex being gone, with one of them suspecting him to be having an affair. Charles Wallace calls them out on it before bringing unwanted attention to Meg. Veronica makes a snide remark about ""crazy running in the family"", which prompts Meg to grab a basketball and hit Veronica in the face with it. Meg is forced to see Principal Jenkins (Andre Holland), who believes Meg has been using her father's disappearance as an excuse to act out. Meg walks out of the office before Jenkins dismisses her.Kate orders Meg to write an an apology to both Principal Jenkins and Veronica. Moments later, Charles Wallace opens the door to a stranger, a woman in a white dress with bright red hair named Mrs. Whatsit (Reese Witherspoon). She has apparently been talking to Charles Wallace for a while and knows who his mom and sister are. Mrs. Whatsit tells Kate that her husband was right and that a tesseract is real, which leaves Kate stunned.The next day, Meg and Charles Wallace are walking their dog. They meet Calvin O'Keefe (Levi Miller), a classmate of Meg's who thought it was cool that she spiked Veronica in the face. They follow Charles Wallace as he runs into the home of a woman called Mrs. Who (Mindy Kaling), a wise woman and friend of Mrs. Whatsit who studies written works from every century.The children return to the Murry house, where Calvin shares a meal with the family. Kate discusses what she and Alex had been trying to accomplish. We see a flashback to prior to Alex's disappearance where the two of them discussed with a group of other scientists the possibility of creating a tesseract in order to travel across the universe, but everyone laughed at what Alex was saying.Outside, Calvin learns that Veronica is Meg's neighbor. Meg tries to get Calvin to hide because she thinks him being seen with her will damage his reputation, but Veronica has already seen them. Soon, the children are visited by Mrs. Whatsit, Mrs. Who, and the oldest and wisest of the three, Mrs. Which (Oprah Winfrey). They tell Meg that her father is still alive and that his belief in tessering is real. The Misses declare that it is time to find Alex, and they transport the children across the universe.Everyone ends up on another planet called Uriel, which is beautiful and vibrant. The inhabitants are living flower creatures that Mrs. Whatsit communicates with. At her behest, Meg shows the flower creatures a picture of her father, whom they apparently recognize. Mrs. Whatsit transforms into a giant leaf creature and takes the kids for a ride through the sky. They find themselves flying over her back until they spot a dark cloud forming in the sky. This causes Calvin to fall, and the flower creatures catch him. Mrs. Which explains that what they saw is called ""The It"" (voiced by David Oyelowo), the embodiment of darkness coming from the planet Camazotz. It is responsible for the negative energy in the universe and what is keeping Alex imprisoned. We see that The It's influence spreads across Earth and is responsible for Veronica's low self-esteem, other teachers being jealous of Jenkins being promoted to principal, and Calvin's father being terrible to him for getting a less-than-perfect grade.The Misses help the kids tesser to another planet to find the Happy Medium (Zach Galifianakis). With his help, they attempt to find a balance that will allow them to locate Alex. Meg feels she is not strong enough to do so, but the Misses help her find the strength to do so.The Misses leave the children as they are tessered toward Camazotz to find Alex themselves. The three leave them with gifts, such as Mrs. Who's magnifying glasses, and Mrs. Whatsit giving Meg ""her faults"". Meg and Calvin become separated from Charles Wallace as they find themselves in a forest. Soon, a powerful storm happens that creates some kind of cyclone. Meg notices that it is launching trees to a cliff-side where they need to go. She convinces Calvin to hide inside a log and wait for the right moment. Sure enough, the log is shot across the land and makes it to the cliff where the two of them find Charles Wallace.The kids find themselves in a neighborhood where all the children and their mothers act in synchronization. One of the mothers tries to invite the kids inside for dinner, but they decline when they feel it could be a trap. The kids keep walking until they find themselves at a beach filled with people. They are found by a man known as Red (Michael Pena). He claims to know Alex and makes it seem like he'll take the kids to find him. Red gives them food, but Charles Wallace says it tastes like sand. Red says he has passed a test, and he takes Charles Wallace with him as he reveals he is evil. Meg and Calvin chase after them until they end up in some kind of void. Charles Wallace starts acting malicious, as he is apparently possessed by the influence of The It.Meg and Calvin are kept as prisoners, but Meg is able to move forward with the magnifying glasses to see some kind of invisible staircase and finally locate her father. The two of them reunite tearfully and embrace. They return to Calvin, but The It now has a greater hold over Charles Wallace and is threatening to keep them all as prisoners.Meg soon finds herself within the realm of The It. It uses Charles Wallace to try and manipulate Meg into joining her. It creates a ""better"" copy of Meg, one with straight hair, no glasses, and an improved fashion sense. Meg rejects this and tries to save Charles Wallace. Utilizing her faults, she accepts what is not great about herself, but acknowledges that Charles Wallace loves her anyway in spite of all that. Meg's love for him proves to be more powerful than The It's hold, and it is weakened, letting Charles Wallace go.The children reunite with the Misses, who congratulate them for succeeding in their mission.

In doing so, they nurture an understanding and a friendship that would change both their lives.—Kenneth Chisholm (kchishol@rogers.com) New York City bouncer Frank ""Tony Lip"" Vallelonga is searching for new employment after his nightclub is closed for renovations, eventually landing an interview as a driver for ""Doc"" Don Shirley, a famed pianist.

However, Don eventually hires Tony on the strength of others' word, as he needs someone to help him stay out of trouble during an eight-week concert tour through the Deep South. They embark with plans to return home on Christmas Eve. Don's recording studio gives Tony a copy of the ""Green Book"": a guide for Black travelers to find safe havens throughout the segregated South.

When two men start getting into a fist fight, he tosses one out onto the street and gives him a few punches in the face when he resists. He pays the coat check girl to take a rich patron's prized hat so he can ""find"" it and return it to him for a very big tip.The club closes for a few months for renovations, leaving Tony out of work. He and his wife, Dolores (Linda Cardellini), are having trouble making the rent and keeping a roof over their two kids' home. When two black men come over to repair the sink, Dolores gives them lemonade - and Tony throws out their glasses after they use them, much to Dolores's disappointment at her husband's racial views.Tony makes fifty bucks in a hot dog eating contest to make ends meet.

Early the next morning, Don calls Tony's house and asks to speak to Dolores. He asks her if she's okay with her husband being gone for so long. When she agrees, he offers Tony the job. Dolores asks Tony to write her letters, much to his chagrin. The record company rents Tony a nice car, and gives him half the money up front, and tells him he'll get half at the end of the tour - if Don misses a show, he won't get the money. They also give him the 'Green Book', a tourist guide and list of safe places for black people to stay in the segregated Jim Crow southern states.Tony is a loudmouth and a talker, and gets on Don's nerves a lot during the drive. As they approach their first tour stop, Don suggests that Tony use a different last name and try to talk better around the guests, but Tony says if they have a problem with how he talks, he'll wait outside, which he does. From outside he watches Don play piano and is impressed with how brilliant he is. Afterwards, he gambles with the other help who are all also outside, and Don is upset with him for being so low-class. Tony wants to know why Don is giving him such a hard time and no one else - and Don says it's because unlike the other help, Tony had the option of being inside.In the car, Tony plays contemporary music on the radio and is shocked when Don doesn't know popular music like Aretha Franklin. He questions if Dr. Don Shirley is even black, and when he drives by a Kentucky Fried Chicken and finds out Don has never had fried chicken, he stops.

At a later stop, Tony finds a gemstone that's being sold on the ground and pockets it, but Don forces him to put it back, saying it's stealing even though Tony disagrees.As they enter the south, Don has to stay at blacks only hotels separate from Tony. Alone at one motel, Don drinks by himself, alienated from the other black people at the hotel. Tony gets a call at his room that there's a skirmish happening at a local bar, where he finds Don being assaulted by racist white patrons. Tony reaches for a gun and claims he'll shoot if they don't let him go. They narrowly escape, and Don asks if he really has a gun. Tony says of course not, and orders Don to go nowhere without him.At the next concert venue at a Southern mansion, the host is very friendly to Don. For dinner he has had the cooks prepared fried chicken. At intermission, Don asks to use the bathroom, and the host directs him to the outhouse, not allowing him to use the inside bathroom. Don refuses to use the outhouse, so Tony drives him back to his hotel just to use the bathroom there.At the next stop, the two walk by a suit store, and when Don admires a suit in the window, Joe insists he buy it. When they enter the store, the racist employees refuse to sell Don a suit. That evening, Tony is called to a disturbance at a local YMCA where Don and another local white man have been arrested - apparently the gym manager caught them in a fistfight. Tony bribes the police officers to let Don go.At the next town, Tony runs into the mobsters. In Italian, in front of Don, they tell Tony that he should quit and come work for them. Tony agrees to meet them for a drink later that night. As they check into their hotel, Don offers Tony a raise and a promotion. Tony refuses to accept, and Don reveals he speaks Italian. Tony explains he was never going to take the job, he was going to meet them and tell them now. Don is relieved. He awkwardly apologizes to Tony for the situation the night before, but Tony explains that he's been working in New York City nightclubs for years and knows that the world is ""complicated"".Don continues to help Tony with writing the letters, which continue to impress Dolores and the rest of his family. One night while on their way to their final stop somewhere in Mississippi, they are pulled over by the local police. The redneck officer tells them that Don can't be out past sundown (in part due to the town they are in being a Sundown Town... where all black people are under curfew). They are both forced out of the car and frisked, and the officer asks Tony for his ID, who shows the officer his New York driver's license. When the officer asks Tony what kind of last name Vallelonga is, Tony says it's Italian, but that he's only half-Italian. The racist police officer insults Tony by calling him ""half a nigger"". Tony immediately punches the redneck officer in the face, and both him and Don are arrested and taken to jail.In their cell, Don is enraged at Tony, since his hot head cost them the tour. Don demands to make a phone call, since he committed no crime. The police allow him to. A short while later, the police receive an angry call from the Governor and reluctantly release both Tony and Don. Don reveals to Tony that he called the US Attorney General Robert Kennedy. Tony thinks that's amazing, but Don is furious. He is embarrassed that someone so important now sees him as a rabble-rouser. The two men have a huge argument over all their differences - Don sees Tony as a man who refuses to better himself, and Tony sees Don as a man who seems to make things more difficult for himself and fits in nowhere. Don screams at Tony, ""if I'm not black enough, and I'm not white enough, I'm not man enough, then what am I?""The two arrive at the final concert venue at another hotel, where Don is shown to a tiny closet that they refer to as his dressing room. Tony goes to eat in the dining room with the players in the band, but when Don arrives to join them, the concierge refuses to let him eat there. Don refuses to play unless he is able to eat in the dining room. The concierge won't allow it, and Tony pulls him aside to talk to him. Tony tries to reason with him, but the concierge tries to bribe him to get Don to play. Don enters, and tells Tony he'll do the show if Tony wants, knowing Tony won't get paid unless they finish the tour. But Tony sticks with Don, and they bail on the gig despite the screams of the concierge.They go down the street to a bar for black people. Don buys a round of drinks, flashing his wallet filled with money, which a couple of black youths see. After some prodding, Don plays piano with the jazz band. When they leave, Tony spots the two youths waiting behind their car to mug them, and fires two shots off into the air to scare them away... revealing he did have a gun all along.Tony and Don begin their drive back to New York, hoping to make it by Christmas Eve. The weather is really bad, with a lot of snow. They get pulled over again, but this time the cop just warns them their tire is skidding. Tony can't stay awake any longer and can barely see through the snow, and accepts he won't make it home and goes to sleep - but while he sleeps Don drives them the rest of the way to Tony's apartment. He wakes Tony up and encourages him to go home - Tony invites him but he declines. Tony goes upstairs and surprises his family. Don returns to his ornate apartment, and sits there alone. He ends up coming to Tony's, and while most of his family is a little confused, Dolores joyously welcomes him and thanks him for helping Tony with his letters.The post-script reveals that in real life, Tony became the maitre'D of the Copa, and Dr. Shirley continued being successful in music. They remained friends for the rest of their lives."

One day his mother drops him off at a Christian camp where he meets Shannon. Upon his return from camp, Bart finds his mother has left and movers are removing her belongings. He angrily confronts his father, who denies that his abusiveness was the reason she left. Years later, in high school, Bart and Shannon are dating. Bart plays football to please his father, but is injured, breaking both ankles and ending his career. The only elective with openings is music class, so he reluctantly signs up.. The film opens with a young boy named Bart Millard who is 10-years-old and lives in Greenville, Texas. His dad Arthur (Dennis Quaid) is an alcoholic and berates and belittles Bart as well as Bart's mother. Bart always has headphones on to listen to music and creates things out of odds and ends. His dad gets angry at him and throws all of his little creations into a fire pit.Bart's mom takes Bart to a week-long Christian camp and before dropping him off says with tears ""you know I love you right?"" Bart says yes and goes to the camp. As he's walking in, he meets another young camper named Shannon who shows Bart the ropes, and they become fast friends. During the camp Bart knocks over Shannon's journal and exposes a drawing saying ""Shannon Loves Bart Millard,"" and he starts to blush. Shannon confronts him about the journal the next night under a fireworks show and says that maybe someday they'll fall in love. Young Bart comes home from camp with a moving truck in front of the house and finds out that his mom is moving away and he chases the truck down the road screaming for her not to leave.In a jump forward a few years later, Bart (J. Michael Finley as a teenager) is in high school, and he and Shannon are dating. Bart is a football player like his dad was. During a practice, Bart breaks his leg or ankle and is taken to the hospital where his dad informs him that the doctor said he could never play again. Shortly after the accident while at school Bart is spotted by the music director singing a song and she's moved by his performance and casts him as the lead in Oklahoma without his permission. Bart tells her he won't do it, but she convinces him to do it. He takes the role and blows everyone away with his singing.The next morning Bart's father is at a diner and sees a pamphlet for the show with Bart listed as the star, and he falls over in his chair in obvious pain, and it's not clear if it's a heart attack or something else. Upon going to the hospital, he's informed that he had low blood sugar and a mass in his body. We find out soon it's pancreatic cancer and he doesn't seem like he wants treatment. Bart is kind of aloof throughout this part of the film and Shannon constantly presses him to open up and share why he's hurting about his father dying. He refuses to and even tells her he doesn't love her, which breaks her heart.A few months later, upon graduating from high school, Bart immediately leaves Texas with his guitar to pursue a life in music. He ends up in Oklahoma City where he meets a band that would eventually become the group MercyMe. They are going around playing to youth camps and Christian organizations, and they catch the attention of producer Scott Brickell (Trace Adkins) who works with the band and tells Bart he needs to be more real, to which Bart gets a bit defensive about but works on. Bart tries to reconnect with Shannon during this time, but she rebukes his advances.Scott gets MercyMe a Nashville showcase with many record executives and also introduces him to Christian singing stars Amy Grant and Michael W. Smith. Bart is super nervous and chats their ears off before someone whisks him away. The showcase goes well for MercyMe, and they're backstage waiting for Scott to come back and report what all the record executives say. Bart can't wait, and he goes out to talk with all of them who all tell him he's either not good enough or not ready. Bart takes the news hard and quits. Scott convinces him not to do that, but Bart decides he does need to go home and right some wrongs before getting back with the band.Bart comes home to find his father has been reading the bible and is working on becoming a better man. Bart isn't sure if he believes his father's new personality especially after all the physically abuse, but eventually, he learns of his father's grave condition and that he's working on becoming a good Christian and they bond at the end of his life.Another few months later, Bart's father passes away. After the funeral, Bart heads back out to join MercyMe. While on the tour bus he is struck by inspiration and looks in his journal to find the words ""I Can Only Imagine"" written on every page. So he says ""OK Jesus"" and starts writing the lyrics to what will be the song ""I Can Only Imagine."" He sends the song to Scott who freaks out about it, and he plays it for Amy Grant who loves it and wants to debut it on her new tour and album. Bart says he wants as many people as possible to hear the song and Amy is who will make that happen. So at the concert where she's gonna sing it for the first time, Amy is too moved by the sentiment of the song and can't sing it, so she invites Bart up on stage. He proceeds to sing the song with Shannon in the crowd, and the place goes bonkers for the song. After he sings it, he imagines the theater empty with just his dad there clapping for him. He runs up the aisles after the song and hugs Shannon and tells her he loves her.We find out in the postscript that the song went triple platinum and that MercyMe has since had 21 hit songs and is one of the biggest Christian bands of all time."
Smallfoot,2018,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6182908/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"High up on a mountain peak surrounded by clouds, a secret Yeti society lives in peace and harmony. One day, a Yeti witnesses an airplane crash; Inside lies ""Smallfoot"", a legendary creature that will rock the society to its core. Yetis live in on the top of a mountain in the Himalayas, Nepal, above the clouds and hidden away from sight. Migo is a yeti who abides by the law of the ancient stones held by the Stonekeeper, the yetis' leader. Migo's father, Dorgle, projects himself through the air each morning to hit a gong with his head, believing this allows the sun to rise. While learning how to ring the gong, Migo is distracted by the Stonekeeper's daughter, Meechee, whom he loves, and misses the gong, landing outside the village. There, Migo witnesses a plane crash and finds a ""smallfoot"" (human), whom the yetis have taken for legend. Migo runs back to tell the villagers what he saw, but has no proof. The Stonekeeper banishes him from the village. Migo is suddenly visited by Gwangi, Kolka, and Fleem who bring him to the Smallfoot Evidentiary Society (S.E.S.), which is led by Meechee. She convinces Migo to be lowered below the clouds despite the stones telling them that there is nothing underneath. After some hesitation, Migo agrees to go, but his rope snaps and Migo falls, where he discovers land.. The film opens with a yeti named Migo (voice of Channing Tatum) telling the history of his village. He and a large group of other yetis live high on a mountain above the clouds where they live according to a series of stones held by the Stonekeeper (voice of Common). According to the stones, the yetis were pooped out by a yak god and left on the mountain that is held up by ox that must be fed, or their village will fall into ""The Great Nothing"". Migo's father Dorgle (voice of Danny Devito) is the gong ringer who is supposed to summon the ""sky snail"" (sun) to bring the day. Migo and the other yetis are happy and peaceful (""Perfection"").Migo aspires to be the village gong ringer just like his dad. Stonekeeper calls Migo to practice with Dorgle for when his time comes. After a few failed attempts, Dorgle launches Migo toward the gong, but he gets distracted by Meechee (voice of Zendaya), Stonekeeper's daughter that Migo has a crush on. He flies over the gong and tumbles down the other side of the mountain. A plane then crashes down near Migo, and someone is ejected from it. Migo goes over to see the person and is surprised to see that it is a ""Smallfoot"" (human), considered by the yetis to be legendary. Before Migo can bring him back, the wind blows the man by his parachute and sends him down the mountain.Migo runs back to the village to tell the others of his discovery. He brings the whole village with him to the site of the crash, but the plane slides down the mountain and falls over, and its imprint in the snow is blown away, leaving no proof of what Migo saw. Because there isn't a stone to prove that the Smallfoots are real, Stonekeeper accuses Migo of saying that the stones are wrong. Migo admits to disagreeing with the stones, so Stonekeeper banishes him from the village.As Migo walks through the foggy snow, he is found by the yetis Gwangi (voice of LeBron James), Kolka (voice of Gina Rodriguez), and Fleem (voice of Ely Henry). They are part of the S.E.S. (Smallfoot Evidentiary Society, or ""Smallfoot Exists, Suckas""), and because of Migo's claim, they take him to their leader, who turns out to be Meechee. Despite her father's beliefs that Smallfoots don't exist just because of the stones, she believes that there is something or someplace beyond their home (""Wonderful Life""). Meechee convinces Migo to go out and find the Smallfoot.The yetis lower Migo with a rope to go down beneath the mountain. They are interrupted by Meechee's brother Thorp (Jimmy Tatro). In their distraction, Migo falls as the rope breaks and he lands in a bed of snow. He sees the forest for the first time and is astonished by the world outside the mountain.Somewhere in town, we meet Percy Patterson (voice of James Corden), a wildlife documentarian trying to get a video on an exotic spider. His nature show has been struggling in recent times due to people being interested in other things. The man from the plane then comes running in a panic as he tells Percy that he saw a yeti. Percy talks to his assistant Brenda (voice of Yara Shahidi) about trying to get a video of the yeti to boost his ratings, as he has personally fallen on hard times (""Percy's Pressure""). He wants Brenda to get in a yeti suit so they can fake the video and make it go viral, but Brenda refuses, as she once respected Percy for his integrity toward animals.Migo comes down near the bar where Percy is. Percy steps outside and sees Migo, but he thinks it's Brenda in the suit. He is impressed until he sees Brenda riding away with the suit on a snowmobile, and he realizes Migo is a real yeti. Percy freaks out and tries to tranquilize Migo, but he gets himself knocked out, and Migo brings Percy with him.On the journey back to the village, Migo stops inside a cave when Percy gets frozen from the cold. He warms Percy up over a fire, though it appears as though he's trying to roast Percy as a meal. Later, they find that they are in the cave of a tired mama bear (Patricia Heaton). She complains to Migo about him and Percy disturbing her, and Migo tries to talk to her (which Percy can't understand), so it appears to him that Migo is almost saving him. On the way out, Migo gets his foot caught in a bear trap. Percy sees that Migo is hurt, so he bandages his toe up. Migo resumes the journey and accommodates Percy so he can stay warm.The morning nears, and Dorgle prepares to do his duty, but he misses the gong, and his helmet breaks in two, but the sun still rises to his surprise. He rings the gong with both broken helmet pieces, and Dorgle is left questioning his job and purpose.Migo returns to the mountain and reunites with Meechee, Gwangi, Kolka, and Fleem. They arrive in the village so that Migo may present Percy to the whole village. He is amazed to see the whole yeti community. All the yetis then become amazed and intrigued by Percy (""Wonderful Questions""), but Stonekeeper is not very happy at this discovery. Meechee suggests to her father that he talk to Migo to better understand each other. Meanwhile, Percy tries to explain human life to Meechee and the others through drawings, but he starts to feel a little sick.Stonekeeper sends Thorp to bring Migo to their home. There, he tells Migo the truth about their history (""Let It Lie"") - Stonekeeper has always known that humans existed because the yetis used to live below the mountain, but the humans' attempts to eliminate them drove the yetis to live high up. The cloud formation that obscures their view of the land below is a result of the yetis unknowingly dropping blocks of ice into a machine that makes steam so the yetis won't know of the world below, and the history with the stones was just something Stonekeeper made up to protect the others. He asks Migo to help do the same when Migo realizes that Percy did react almost instinctively to attack Percy.Stonekeeper brings Migo in front of the other yetis as he holds Percy, who is suffering due to high altitude sickness and is growing colder and with less oxygen. Migo is forced to lie and say that he didn't find a Smallfoot, but rather a rare form of yak. Everyone is upset, but especially the S.E.S., who know that Migo is involved in a cover-up. Meechee in particular is very upset with Migo. Stonekeeper brings Percy to his cave.Migo feels bad for betraying his friends once they abandon him. He goes to Dorgle, who encourages him to find Meechee. He launches Migo toward her home, but he finds that she isn't in her room. Stonekeeper hears Migo coming in and sees that Meechee is gone, and she's taking Percy back below the mountain.Meechee's friends lower her and Percy down below, and Migo goes after her, along with Gwangi and Kolka, but Fleem takes too long to decide whether or not he should come down (because, according to Gwangi, ""Fleem sucks""). They follow Meechee's footprints and see that she is headed into town. She leaves Percy somewhere warm, but she becomes distracted by the town's views, and the humans spot her and become afraid of her. Percy and Brenda find each other, and she tells him that the video he sent her from his time in the cave with Migo has gone viral. The police arrive and try to capture Meechee, but Migo and the others save her and they hide out in a yeti museum, where they find that the humans think they are monsters.The yetis try to run back up to the mountain but are chased by a SWAT helicopter. Stonekeeper shows up and throws all of his stones to take the helicopter down (but not hurt those inside). Migo comes across Percy, who reluctantly shoots a tranquilizer dart at him. It then appears as though Migo has stumbled toward the police, and that they have shot him, but it's really Percy in the yeti suit to create a distraction, but now everyone thinks that he faked the yeti video. He and Brenda reconcile, but Percy is arrested for creating a disturbance and destruction of property. Percy then deletes all the pictures and videos he took with the yetis to protect their existence.Migo and his friends go back up the mountain after they realize Percy saved Migo, and only then does Fleem come down when it's too late. With Stonekeeper's help, Migo speaks to the village again, saying that while the humans may seem terrified of them, and vice versa, the yetis should still give them a chance. Stonekeeper helps Migo stop the steam machines so that the yetis can finally see the land below them.The yetis make their way toward the town. The humans gather, once again nervous and a bit panicked, but Percy walks through the police blockade, followed by Brenda, to prove that the yetis are not dangerous. The other humans soon follow, and the yetis start to have friendly interactions. Meanwhile, Fleem is the only one who has failed to make it down the mountain, until he gets scared off by a goat.The closing credits show little drawings on stone of how the humans and yetis now play with and learn from each other."
Night School,2018,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6781982/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A group of high school dropouts is forced to attend night school in hopes that they will pass the GED exam to finish high school. In 2001, high-school student Teddy Walker drops out of school when he's unable to concentrate during a crucial test. In 2018 he works as a barbecue-grill salesman and dates a wealthy woman named Lisa, and has developed a careful financial strategy that allows him to maintain the illusion that he is better off than he actually is. But his life falls apart just as he learns that he will inherit control of the store when the current manager retires: As he proposes to Lisa in the shop, he accidentally triggers an explosion when a champagne cork pops open a gas tank; the manager runs away with the insurance from the explosion. Teddy's friend is willing to give him a job--if he can earn his GED. Atlanta, Georgia, 2001Teddy Walker (Kevin Hart) is a local high school student in his bedroom studying for the SAT's, but is having a difficult time concentrating. He goes downstairs to dinner with his parents Gerald (Keith David) and Carole (Donna Briscoe), and twin sister Denise (Bresha Webb) where he complains about having to take the test. Only his mother has any sympathy for him, while his father and sister think Teddy is just making excuses.The next day, Teddy goes to school for the test, but after barely a minute of sitting down, he declares that he is not taking the test and that he is done with school for good.Present Day.Teddy is a moderately successful barbecue salesman who is dating Lisa (Megalyn Echikunwoke). His boss Joe (Tim Ware) tells Teddy that when he retires, he plans to leave the store to Teddy, who is ecstatic to hear the news.Teddy later joins his buddy Marvin (Ben Schwartz), along with Lisa and her friend Maya (Yvonne Orji) to a dinner at a fancy restaurant. Teddy feels insecure about Lisa always paying for everything, so he offers to pay for the meal himself, until he sees that the bill is over $800. He reaches into his pants and pulls out some pubes to put in his dessert so that he can accuse the staff of tampering with the food and not have to pay. The waiter, Luis (Al Madrigal), knows that Teddy planted them, so they argue until the head chef comes by and believes Teddy's side of the story, leading to Luis getting fired and the meal being free.Teddy drives Lisa to the BBQ store where he has set up a proposal for her. She accepts, and Teddy pops some champagne. The cork hits a propane tank, which starts to leak gas into the store. Lisa smells it, so Teddy tries to take care of it. After turning off the grills, he tries to plug in a fan to get rid of the smell, but the spark ignites the gas and causes a huge explosion that wrecks the store and sends Teddy flying onto the windshield of his car.Teddy visits Marvin to ask for a job since Joe took the insurance money and fled to Florida, and there's not a hot market for grill salespeople with no GED. Marvin says that they can hire Teddy at his firm, but he needs the GED. Teddy impulsively tells Lisa that he will be working with Marvin, even though it's not a done deal.Teddy drives to his old high school, Piedmont High. On the road, he runs into a woman, Carrie Carter (Tiffany Haddish), who is talking loudly to her mother over some bizarre sex thing with her priest. The two argue until the light turns green.At the school, Teddy is dismayed to find that the principal is Stewart Patosky (Taran Killam), a dorky kid from his time at school that bugged Teddy, but Teddy also made fun of Stewart for having a third nipple. Stewart relishes the opportunity to deny Teddy a chance to get his GED by saying that they don't offer night school classes, but Teddy learns that this is not the case when he finds that Carrie works there, and she is the night school teacher. After a bit of hassling, Teddy decides to enroll for the night classes.Teddy starts the night school classes and tries to schmooze his way to a passing grade by bringing Carrie tacos. The other students show up, and she gives them the tacos to show that she can't be bought. The others introduce themselves: Luis, who remembers Teddy and has to get his GED since he got fired and wants to be a dental hygienist; Theresa (Mary Lynn Rajskub), a mother of three who dropped out of high school and wants a reason to leave the house; Jaylen (Romany Malco), a man who is paranoid of a robot apocalypse; Mila (Anne Winters), a girl who got kicked out of her school for having molly and is getting her GED to avoid jail time; Mackenzie, AKA ""Big Mac"" (Rob Riggle), who is trying to get his GED to stop his own son from making the same mistake he did in his youth; and Bobby (Fat Joe), an inmate who is attending the class through Skype.Marvin finds Teddy a temporary job that doesn't require a GED - wearing a chicken suit for a religious fried chicken restaurant called Christian Chicken. Although Teddy finds it humiliating and degrading, he has no choice but to accept the job. He also finds that he has to sneak around to avoid telling Lisa about his issue, and she thinks it's just him getting cold feet.Carrie teaches the class about the Pythagorean Theorem, but they are interrupted when someone tries to shank Bobby in the library. He then beats down his potential attackers before they are dragged out of there by guards. Moments later, Stewart comes in to check on the class and is not happy that Teddy enrolled after all. He sits down as Carrie makes Teddy go up to the board to solve the problem. He has a difficult time solving it until Carrie lets him off with a hint, but she promises that's the only time it'll ever happen.Desperate, Teddy convinces the other students to help steal the answers to the GED test. The others agree to it, and they sneak into the school that night. Mac chokes out a janitor to avoid witnesses, even though nobody told him to do that. They then go into Stewart's office where Mila tries to hack into his computer and get the answers. Stewart starts walking toward his office, so Theresa tries to distract him by flirting with him. She's really bad at it, and Stewart brushes her off out of integrity, but he quietly admits he would have went for it. He then goes to his computer while the others are hiding. Teddy sees that Stewart is going on his Facebook to look at Lisa's profile and add her as a friend. Mac nearly blows their cover when he sneezes, but Stewart is pulled out by the janitor's screams. The group tries to get out, but Stewart places the school on lock-down, which forces them to retreat to the rooftops. They realize they have to jump over to the next roof, which only Mila is able to do. Mac attempts it, but he falls hard and messes up his arm. And then Jaylen pukes on him.Carrie later finds out that the answers were taken, and she plans to dismiss all the students. When Teddy hears their protests and sees that they need to be there, he takes the fall for them, and Carrie kicks him out. He later sees her personally to ask for a second chance. She reluctantly agrees to it and runs some tests on Teddy to determine his problem with learning. She later tells Teddy that he has multiple learning disabilities like dyslexia and dyscalculia. Carrie puts Teddy through some serious learning exercises to ensure that he is ready and able to focus. Teddy is also able to form legitimate friendships with his classmates.On the final night of classes, Carrie decides to pop open some champagne to celebrate. They hear music from the prom going on, and since none of them went during their time at school, they decide to go. They all dance and have a good time. Teddy and Carrie share a friendly dance, which is interrupted when Lisa shows up, as Stewart had invited her and Maya to come check out the school and potentially help with renovations. Teddy is forced to explain himself and reveal that he's been going to night school. Lisa is hurt that he couldn't be honest with her because he felt that he needed to impress her. She gives him his ring back and tells him not to go back to their apartment, so Teddy must return to his parents' home.Teddy decides to give up on the GED since he did it for Lisa, and without her, he sees no point to it. He is visited by Stewart and Carrie at his job, where Stewart apologizes for humiliating him and admits that he wanted to get back at him because Teddy was better then him in high school. Carrie also forces Teddy to not give up and demands that he takes the test. When Teddy accidentally offends them by holding up his cross and saying he will beat them, he gets whipped and gets in the car to the test.Teddy shows up on the day of the test. He does his hardest to focus. Later, the students are gathered around for their test results. Everyone passes except Teddy. Although disappointed, he tries a few more times and still fails until he finally gets a 178, which is more than enough to qualify for a passing grade. Everyone at Christian Chicken cheers for Teddy.The night school class graduates with the main students of the school (even Bobby, although he's there in cuffs). Teddy is picked to give a speech to everyone, just as Lisa shows up. After the ceremony, Teddy apologizes to Lisa and asks to start over. She accepts. The class then gathers to take a picture together.In the final shot, is a brief clip of Stewart busting some dance moves at a party."

The NFFA offers residents of the Island $5000 to stay in their homes during the experiment and a compensation for those participating as well. They also outfit the participants with tracking devices and contact lenses with cameras in them so that they can monitor all activity.

She is angry because she thinks that Dmitri has Isaiah dealing for him, but Dmitri says he never knew he was dealing and never would have taken him in like that.On the evening of the experiment, many people make their way off the Island via ferries. Nya joins her friends Dolores (Mugga) and Luisa (Luna Lauren Velez), as well as Luisa's daughter Selina (Kristen Solis) at church where they will wait out the Purge. Nya thinks that Isaiah is with their uncle in Brooklyn, but he has stayed to participate in the Purge so he can go after Skeletor. Meanwhile, Dmitri has stayed in his office while Capital A has sent two hookers there to keep Dmitri company.Isaiah goes out into the streets with his gun. Skeletor has joined the Purge as well, and he finds a man trying to break open an ATM, and Skeletor stabs him to death. This is recorded as the very first Purge of the night. The footage goes viral quickly after the NFFA gets their hands on the video. They observe that there are more parties being thrown around the area compared to what they were originally expecting.Skeletor walks upon one of the Purge parties happening, which is just a rave going on in the middle of the streets. He stabs a few people to death before the crowd runs away in fear. Isaiah has him cornered and aims his gun at him, but he fails to pull the trigger, drops the gun, and runs away. Skeletor chases after him as Isaiah runs through bad neighborhoods where other murderous Purgers are running loose. He finds a quiet spot to call Nya for help, and she leaves to go find him.As Nya goes to look for Isaiah, Dmitri is visited by the hookers. As they seduce him, they quickly turn out to be Purgers who try to kill him. At the same time, we see Nya get caught by Skeletor, who tries to cut and rape her, but Isaiah stabs Skeletor in the back and runs away with Nya. Dmitri fights off the hookers and learns that they were sent by Capital A to take Dmitri out so that he can assume control of the block, as well as to receive their payment so they can leave their business.Nya and Isaiah make their way back to the church, only to find Purgers walking out of it, covered in blood. After the Purgers disperse, Nya finds Luisa and Selina alive, but they don't know where Dolores went. They make their way to Nya and Isaiah's apartment for safety. Once there, they are met by Dolores, who managed to make it through the streets in one piece, albeit very shaken up.At the NFFA headquarters, Updale reviews the footage of the evening and notices teams of people killing civilians, including those at the church. Sabian tells her that he had mercenaries sent out to kill people in the overpopulated and impoverished neighborhoods as a way to set a balance between the rich and the poor. After giving her this information, Sabian has Updale taken to a shady neighborhood where she is executed. He orders footage of this to be deleted.Meanwhile, Capital A goes by Dmitri's place to ask the hookers what became of Dmitri. He gets his answer when Dmitri's still-loyal crew members draw their guns on Capital A and his goons. Dmitri comes out and executes him before the goons get shot too. Dmitri then proceeds to meet with the rest of his crew, only for him and his buddy to get their car rammed into by a flaming truck. Purgers step out to shoot people on the streets, but Dmitri snaps one of their necks and steals his gun to shoot the others. He heads to meet the crew and finds that they are cornered by Purgers dressed in Klan uniforms. The Klansmen fire upon the men in the building until they have smoke bombs thrown at their feet, leaving the Klansmen blind and open to get slaughtered. Dmitri re-teams with his whole crew until NFFA drones shoot them all dead.Dmitri contacts Nya when he finds that the mercenaries are headed to her apartment. He orders her to stay hidden and get what she can to protect herself and the others. Sure enough, the mercs are viciously gunning down everybody on every floor. Dmitri grabs as many guns as he can carry and heads to the building. He finds three mercs and fights them before shooting two of them and strangling the third. The other mercs are making their way up to the top floor where Nya and the others are. Luisa, Selina, and Dolores hide in the closet for safety. Dmitri kills more mercs until he joins the others. Two mercs break into the apartment, but Nya shoots them both in the legs before she and Isaiah stab them in the necks. As the mercs reach Nya's place, they prepare to shoot an RPG until Skeletor shows up and slays three mercs before getting shot dead. Dmitri grabs a C4 explosive and tosses it into the other room, shooting it until it blows up and obliterates the remaining mercs.The survivors make their way out of the room as the sirens signaling the end of the Purge go off. Dmitri got shot, but Nya and Isaiah help him walk out. The other survivors meet up outside where they view Dmitri as a hero. Isaiah asks what happens now, and Dmitri says it's time for them to fight back.As the end credits roll, Sabian issues a statement saying that the Purge was a success, and they will begin to roll out a nationwide Purge starting the following year."
Game Night,2018,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2704998/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A group of friends who meet regularly for game nights find themselves entangled in a real-life mystery when the shady brother of one of them is seemingly kidnapped by dangerous gangsters. Married competitive gamer couple Max and Annie are trying to have a child, but their attempts are unsuccessful due to Max's stress surrounding his feelings of inadequacy when compared to his successful, attractive brother Brooks. During Max and Annie's routine weekend game night with their friends Ryan, and married couple Kevin and Michelle, Brooks shows up Max by arriving in a Corvette Stingray (Max's dream car) and sharing an embarrassing childhood story about Max. Brooks offers to host the next game night at a house he's renting while he's in town. Meanwhile, Max and Annie are trying to keep their game nights secret from their neighbor Gary, an awkward police officer after his divorce from their friend Debbie.. Married Max and Annie are individually and as a pair ultra-competitive in every aspect of life, especially in playing games, they having met when they were captains on competing teams at a bar trivia night. They routinely host game nights which include married Kevin and Michelle, who have been sweethearts for what seems like all their lives, and less than bright Ryan and whoever the latest dim bulb he is dating at any given time. These nights used to include Gary and Debbie until their divorce, intense Gary, a police officer who now lives next door to them, excluded in he never really having been *their* friend. Gary would be gutted if he knew for certain they still have the game nights without him in he considering them his best friends in return. Max's competitiveness extends to feelings toward his more successful brother, venture capitalist Brooks, the stress of feeling emasculated in the comparison which Annie believes is the reason for Max's low sperm count and they unable to conceive despite trying. That competitive streak hits a new level when Brooks returns to town wanting to host a game night of what he considers the next echelon of games, a murder mystery of sorts where he has hired a company specializing in organizing and enacting such, thus not even he knowing who may be actors entering their lives this evening. In what Max, Annie, Kevin, Michelle, Ryan and his surprisingly bright date Sarah initially believe is Brooks' admittedly great game in FBI agents and Bulgarian thugs with guns entering their lives, they all slowly come to the realization that who they are facing are real Bulgarian thugs with real guns filled with real bullets. They subsequently also come to the realization that one of the best ways to save themselves under this situation is to bring Gary back into their lives without him knowing what's going on, both items which may be easier said than done. Max and Annie necessarily evaluate their lives in the process.—Huggo The film starts with a trivia night competition at a bar. Two teams are competing, and the most competitive members from each team, Max (Jason Bateman) and Annie (Rachel McAdams), meet when they answer the same question correctly. The two start dating as they start beating their friends during their game nights until Max proposes to Annie during a game of Charades, and the two later get married and play each other at a dancing game.In the present day, Max and Annie are trying to have kids, but when they visit Dr. Chin (Camille Chen), they learn that they are having trouble conceiving, which is attributed to Max feeling stressed out lately. Annie figures that Max is stressing over his older, more successful brother Brooks (Kyle Chandler) visiting that night, as he has always been upstaging Max throughout their lives.Max and Annie return home to prepare for their game night later that evening. They run into their creepy neighbor Gary (Jesse Plemons), who used to attend game nights with his wife Debbie (Jessica Clair Lee) until their divorce. Everyone finds him really weird and annoying, so his only company is his dog Bastian. Gary notices they are setting up for a game night, but the couple denies it so they won't have to invite him.The couple's friends arrive later that night. There's childhood sweethearts Kevin (Lamorne Morris) and Michelle (Kylie Bunbury), and dim-witted Ryan (Billy Magnussen), who brings a pretty but equally dim date, and the others point out that he always loses because he brings dumb girls with him. The friends sneak in by climbing in through the windows since Max and Annie told them to do so since they don't want Gary to know they really are having a game night. Unfortunately, this is ruined when Brooks pulls up in a Stingray (Max's dream car) and makes it painfully obvious to Gary that Max and Annie lied to him. When Brooks does join the game, he hijacks it by telling the party about an embarrassing story from Max's childhood when he supposedly tried to blow himself. This throws Max off his game and he and Annie lose. Brooks then invites everyone to go to his house the next week for game night. Annie becomes upset because she feels Brooks is deliberately screwing with Max and ruining their chances of conceiving. She supports Max in taking Brooks down the following week.During the next game night, everyone shows up at Brooks's really nice house. Ryan brings a new woman, Sarah (Sharon Horgan), whom he brought because she is significantly smarter than all the other girls he's brought with him. Brooks starts the party off by having everyone do a drinking game of ""Never Have I Ever"". When the matter of sleeping with a celebrity is mentioned, Michelle takes a drink, which makes Kevin feel insecure as he didn't know about this in the whole time they were together.Moments later, a man, ""Agent Henderson"" (Jeffrey Wright), enters the house with FBI dossiers that will serve as clues that will lead them to go on a hunt for kidnappers, and the winners get Brooks's Stingray, which gives Max more of an incentive to win. However, two real kidnappers break in, knock out Henderson, and start attacking Brooks. Brooks fights the two men all around the house while everyone thinks it's part of the game. Brooks is eventually taken, and the gang looks over the dossiers to read the clues. Max and Annie leave when they figure their clue out, while Sarah manages to get in touch with the people who made the game so that she and Ryan can get a step up, and Kevin and Michelle are trapped in Brooks's office when Ryan leaves them in there as they have found a clue. Kevin tries to climb through the ceiling over a stack of boxes, causing him to topple over and knock the door open.Max and Annie are led to a bar, with Annie having taken a real gun that fell out of Brooks's pocket during the struggle, but she thinks it's a prop. In the bar, they see Brooks in the back room and hold the men in the bar at gunpoint while they try to get to Brooks. When they find him, Brooks says none of this is part of the game and that he is in real trouble with real bad guys. Annie then fools around with the gun until she fires it off and sees it's real. She accidentally shoots Max in the arm, causing him to bleed severely. The bad guys start to break in, so Max and Annie grab Brooks and run out. As they drive away, Brooks admits that his success never came from working on Wall Street like he's always claimed, but rather because he's been smuggling stuff, and he stole a Faberge egg from a criminal called The Bulgarian and sold it to someone named Marlon Freeman. The villains then find Max and Annie's car and go after them. Brooks jumps out of the car so that Max and Annie can get away, leading him to get taken again.Ryan and Sarah go to the publishing company and meet Glenda (Chelsea Peretti), who just came from a murder mystery party where she was the corpse, so she startles the two. They have to bribe her into giving up the next clue. Meanwhile, the actual actors playing kidnappers show up at Brooks's house, leading Kevin and Michelle to realize that everything that happened earlier was real. They get in touch with Ryan and Sarah after learning the truth.Max and Annie stop to buy supplies so that Annie can take care of Max's gunshot wound. It leads to her cutting into his bone, the two of them gagging uncontrollably, and then ultimately realizing that the bullet exited Max's arm earlier.The group all go to Gary's house since he's a cop and would have a computer that has information on the aliases Brooks told Max. They are forced to play Jenga with Gary while Max goes to his office to use the computer. The office is full of memorabilia of Gary and Debbie when they were married. Max learns that Marlon Freeman is really a rich guy named Donald Anderton (Danny Huston), while The Bulgarian has evaded capture. Bastian then wanders into the room as Max's arm drips blood onto the carpet, and then onto the dog. Max tries to clean it off but only makes things worse. He then rounds everyone up to leave.The kidnappers call Max and warn him that they'll kill Brooks within less than an hour if they don't deliver the egg. The group arrives at Anderton's home to find the egg. Anderton is holding a fight club in the basement, which Ryan and Sarah watch while the others go look for the egg. During their search, after much badgering over the matter, Michelle finally admits to Kevin that the celebrity she apparently slept with was Denzel Washington. She recounts the story and even has a picture, until Kevin has to tell her that it wasn't Denzel, but a guy who looks a lot like him. Meanwhile, Max and Annie bring up the matter of having a kid, which seems like less of something Max wants, which Annie deduces is because he wishes he were more like Brooks.Ryan spots the egg in a vault and goes to grab it while everyone watches the fight. Unfortunately, he is spotted, and he runs away with the egg. Anderton's guards chase the group as they run around the house with the egg, but they finally manage to take it and leave the house.The group arrives at the bridge where they must meet the kidnappers, but Kevin hits the brakes too hard, and the egg goes flying and shatters against the dashboard. They notice that something was inside the egg - a list of people in witness protection. The group approaches the kidnappers with the paper, and they force the group to get on the ground. While they speak to their employer, Brooks apologizes to Max for how he treated him and for lying to him. He tells Max the keys to the Stingray are in his jacket pocket. The kidnappers then decide to execute the group until Gary arrives and shoots them. Gary figured that something suspicious was up with the group with how they acted all night. One of the kidnappers then shoots Gary. Max and Annie go to help him until Max notices a blood capsule fall out of Gary's mouth. He reveals that he hired the kidnappers to take over Brooks's game night so that he can get back in the game. When the group hands him the WitSec list, Gary says he wasn't in on that. Then, The Bulgarian (Michael C. Hall) appears with his bodyguard and shoots Gary for real. Brooks swallows the list, so the villains take Brooks with him to their jet.Max and Annie run to Brooks's house to take the Stingray and drive to the jet. As the jet is preparing to fly, Max manages to take out the wheels and cause the jet to go down. The Bulgarian's guard goes after the couple. Annie tries to distract the guard while Max goes to save Brooks. Max fights The Bulgarian while Annie is held at gunpoint by the guard. In the fight, the turbines go on, causing the guard to get sucked in and get shredded. Annie then knocks out The Bulgarian with a fire extinguisher, and the two of them free Brooks. He tries to play it off like this was also part of the game, but he's just kidding.Three months later, the gang gathers at Brooks's house for game night since he is serving 3 years of house arrest. He says it's not all bad since he sold the WitSec list on the black market for $3 million and also tipped off the people on that list for $20,000 a pop. The group even has Gary rejoin them, but he still sucks at the games. They play Pictionary, and Annie uses it to announce to Max that she is pregnant. The two of them embrace while their friends congratulate them. We then pan outside to see two guys in masks with guns preparing to go into the house.During the closing credits, we see a detailed look at how Gary planned to hijack Brooks's game night. After the credits, we see the man that Michelle mistook for Denzel meeting a new woman - Debbie."

With newfound confidence, they each begin to come alive as exciting romances are ignited and old flames are rekindled. Through it all, the ladies inspire one other to make this next stage of their lives the best and steamiest thus far. Four women have attended a monthly book club for thirty years, where they bond over the suggested literature.

Executive chef Carol is trying to insert spice into her marriage to her husband of thirty-five years Bruce, Carol who still craves intimacy and sex, both now non-existent, as Bruce, who she knows still loves her, seems more interested in other things besides her since his retirement six months ago. Widowed less than a year ago, Diane, whose marriage was a loving and stable one, is now coddled by her two Scottsdale residing adult daughters, Adrianne and Jill, who treat her more as a helpless child than their capable mother, and who want her to move into Adrianne's basement suite so that they can better take care of her. As such, Diane feels the need to hide from them that for the first time since being widowed, she has met a man, airline pilot Mitchell, who she may want to be a big part of her future if he is given the opportunity. Federal judge Sharon has been divorced for eighteen years from Tom, and while she doesn't miss him, she misses what he represented to her as demonstrated by the fact that she has not had sex with anyone else in all those years. Her three friends egg her on to explore the sometimes treacherous world of online dating. And hotelier Vivian has never looked for love in feeling such would impede her independence as she is content with her life with a proverbial stableful of casual sexual partners.

Jonathan sends Lewis to stay with Florence for a few days.In Florence's home, Lewis notices a poster advertising Isaac and Jonathan as a magician duo. Florence shows Lewis a series of flashbacks that showed Isaac and Jonathan performing as magicians together until Isaac went MIA during World War II. Isaac later returned home, but was suffering from PTSD. He mentioned being in The Black Forest, which is known for harboring dark magic, and Florence thinks Isaac made a deal with a dark warlock there in exchange for the powers he later possessed. He also later married the spiteful and wicked Selena. Florence then explains how Isaac performed the dark magic ritual to make a key for the clock, which is believed to have been made from Selena's finger bone. When Lewis asks Florence why she can't help stop Isaac, she takes a look at a picture of her deceased husband and daughter. She states that because of her pain, she hasn't been able to work the same magic that she used to.When Lewis tries to warn Tarby about Isaac, Tarby punches him in the stomach and orders him to keep quiet or he'll break Lewis's arms. Lewis goes back home to find the blueprints so he can help out, but he is attacked by flying books. He gets out as Jonathan and Florence arrive to help him. He tells the two that he can read the blueprints, but he needs ovaltine. They go to a nearby candy store where Lewis uses a bunch of chocolate powder to try and decipher the markings on the blueprints. They soon discover that the clock is a doomsday device that will reverse time all the way to the beginning.The three return home to find the horseshoes have been pulled off the walls, meaning Isaac was there. They enter the house to find it ransacked. Jonathan and Florence decide to destroy the key, but it won't dissolve in the acid they dip it in. Lewis then confesses to resurrecting Isaac just to impress Tarby and also because he thought that if the spell worked, he could see his parents again. Feeling betrayed, Jonathan decides he wants to send Lewis away for disobeying him. Lewis runs away crying and Florence tells Jonathan that he is being a coward for trying to avoid responsibility for the boy.Lewis notices Issac in the house of Jonathan's neighbor Mrs. Hanchett (Colleen Camp). Lewis brings her to the house, but before Lewis can find Jonathan, Isaac emerges. He then reveals that Mrs. Hanchett is really Selena in disguise and that she killed the real Mrs. Hanchett, took her place, and that the key was made from her bones. Selena also reveals that she was taking the form of Mrs. Barnavelt to persuade Lewis into doing her bidding to bring Isaac back.Isaac captures Lewis, followed by Jonathan and Florence. He explains to them that because of the horrors he saw in the war, he wanted to completely forget what he saw. He met a demon named Azazel in The Black Forest and he granted Isaac the power to make his wish come true. Issac reveals that the clock will turn time back so that humanity never existed and uses the creepy dolls and killer pumpkins to send the three away.Jonathan apologizes to Lewis for how he talked to him and they all plan to go back and stop Isaac and Selena. Lewis uses the Magic 8-Ball to learn that the location of the clock is under the boiler room. Using all their wits and magic, the three go back to destroy the pumpkins and dolls to find the clock.Florence gets taken by Jonathan's mutated snake named Snakespeare, leaving Lewis and Jonathan to face the villains on their own. Isaac awaits as the lunar eclipse is setting, which will activate the clock's power. He and Selena are protected from the clock's effects. Lewis and Jonathan try to fight back, but Jonathan is morphed into a weird baby that still has his adult head. The eclipse happens, and people around town start to de-age to children. Lewis consults the Magic 8-Ball to know what to do and it says ""Say goodbye"". Lewis realizes he has to let go of his pain from losing his parents to harness his true power. He drops the ball into the clock's gears to slow it down, which makes Isaac and Selena leave their protected post. Using his own magic, Lewis zaps Isaac and Selena, causing them to fall, de-age, and ultimately be erased from existence. Everything goes back to normal as Florence reveals that she has fixed Snakespeare and Lewis offers her to be part of his new family.Lewis goes back to school with more confidence. Tarby and his friend refuse to pick Lewis for sports, so Lewis shows off a little bit of magic by making a basketball bounce off Tarby and his friend's faces to sink it into the net. Even though everyone now wants Lewis on their team, he instead hangs out with Rose Rita.Jonathan then picks him up from school where they go home with Florence as the three of them are now like a regular family."
Skyscraper,2018,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5758778/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A security expert must infiltrate a burning skyscraper, 225 stories above ground, when his family is trapped inside by criminals. FBI Hostage Rescue Team leader and U.S. war veteran Will Sawyer now assesses security for skyscrapers. On assignment in Hong Kong he finds the tallest, safest building in the world suddenly ablaze and he's been framed for it. A wanted man on the run, Will must find those responsible, clear his name and somehow rescue his family who are trapped inside the building - above the fire line.—ahmetkozan Building security expert Will Sawyer (Dwayne Johnson) is blamed when the tallest, most advanced building in the world, located in Hong Kong, bursts into flames. On the run from the police, the former FBI agent and amputee must infiltrate the inferno to rescue his wife (Neve Campbell) and children trapped inside, clear his name, and find out the truth behind the attack on the skyscraper. Ten full years after that fateful hostage situation that cost him his left leg, the former leader of an FBI Hostage Rescue Team and now a private security consultant, Will Sawyer, travels with his family to exotic Hong Kong to certify the world's tallest skyscraper, the Pearl. However, a sinister conspiracy, and a team of ruthless, blackmailing mercenaries threaten to burn Chinese multi-billionaire Zhao Long Ji's prized possession to a crisp, when they manage to infiltrate the building and start a fire. Now, the city's safest building has trapped Will's family somewhere in the 96th floor, above the raging inferno, and Sawyer, with the police hot on his trail, must summon up the courage to enter the high-rise. But, can he reach his family before the all-consuming fire turns the skyscraper into a massive, 225-storey chimney?—Nick Riganas A male security officer does everything that he can do to rescue his family who are trapped in a burning skyscraper. He must climb multiple levels to enter the skyscraper before time runs out and before everything inside is completely destroyed by the people in charge.—RECB3 Ten years ago, Will Sawyer leads an FBI Hostage Rescue Team in which Ben Gillespie is one of his colleagues. The team blow up the wall of a house and they go inside, where they find the hostage taker holding on to his son. The hostage taker lets his child go, then presses the button to detonate a suicide bomb. Will is badly injured in the subsequent explosion. Part of his left leg below the knee has to be amputated.In the present, Will, who is now wearing a false leg following the amputation, his wife Sarah, and his twin children Henry and Georgia, live in an apartment inside The Pearl, the world's tallest skyscraper, located in Hong Kong. At 1,060 metres (3,500 feet) tall, it is taller than the Burj Khalifa. Zhao Long Ji is the business entrepreneur behind the construction of the 225 floor building. Sarah asks Will to fix her phone. Will just turns the phone off and on again. Ben appears out of the elevator. Sarah is taking the children off to see the pandas being fed overnight after everyone else has gone home, after Ben gave them tickets to see it. Will rides with Ben up the elevator for a meeting with Zhao, security director Ajani Okeke and insurance underwriter Mr Pearce. Zhao hired Will to assess the safety and security systems on a recommendation from Ben. Will reports to the meeting that the computerized fire and security systems have passed his tests, though he needs to inspect the security at the off-site facility. Zhao gives Will a tablet. Only Will's face can access it. Zhao takes Will to a room where mirrors pop up from the floor, mirrors that give reflections at different angles. A reflection of Zhao tells Will ""I'm over there.""Will rides on a boat with Ben. When they reach their destination, an agile, acrobatic criminal steals Will's bag. He fires shots up in the air to scare the people around him. In the Sub Basement of The Pearl, a maintenance engineer sees a crack in the wall appearing. The wall breaks off to reveal a hole. Hands reach out and strangle this person to death. The killer removes a gas mask. It's Kores Botha. Ben is bandaging Will's wound. Will put Zhao's tablet in his jacket before they left. Sarah speaks to Will on the phone. They didn't get to see the pandas. Henry ate a weird candy and started throwing up. They've returned to The Pearl. Henry is okay, only no pandas. Ben pulls out a gun and tells Will that he is also working for Kores. He demands that Will hand him the tablet. A fight breaks out between them. In the struggle, Ben is accidentally shot in the chest with his own gun. A dying Ben tells Will his family were not meant to go back into The Pearl, inferring that the panda feeding tickets for the family were part of Ben's strategy to get them out of the building.Kores and his men sprinkle powder containing a water-reactive chemical over the 96th floor inside The Pearl. Kores sets off the smoke alarm. When the sprinklers come on, the powder flares up and a fire starts. Will looks out the window and sees a bright orange light coming from The Pearl. People come with machine guns and fire at Will. Will gets out the window and climbs down a ladder. He has to fall the rest of the way. Xia, one of Kores's associates, appears and zaps Will with an electric stun gun. She scans Will's face into the tablet. Police officers arrive and shoot the criminals surrounding Will. The criminal who stole Will's bag is killed in the shootout. Xia drives away in a van. She shoots a police officer off his motorcycle. Will gets on the motorcycle and heads towards The Pearl.Xia and the goons enter the off-site facility and kill the staff already there. With access to the tablet, they disable the anti-fire measures. The sprinklers stop working. The goon gives the building ""a six point five billion dollar chimney."" The air vents open. Two security men come out of the elevator to take Sarah and the children up to the top floor. Fire is shooting up the elevator shaft. The security man shouts ""NO! GET BACK!"" Fire explodes out of the elevator. Inspector Wu leads a manhunt for Will Sawyer, with police believing that he disabled the anti-fire measures. The goon says to Xia, ""You have full systems control from the tablet. There's no facial recognition needed. All other access points to The Pearl mainframe have been encrypted. The entire building now, it's locked out. I used my own logarithmic base cipher to encrypt it, so I am literally the only human on the planet Earth that can crack this. It's pretty smart right?"" Xia shoots him.Ajani, working as Zhao's personal bodyguard, says ""If the fire continues to climb, it will super heat the air around the helipad, making lift off impossible. Our departure window is closing. I hate to say it, but it is now or never."" Urged on by Mr Pierce, Zhao finally agrees to get the helicopter ready for evacuation. This isn't just a fire. It's a plot. Zhao knows Kores Botha is behind this. Kores does not want Zhao dead, at least not yet. He wants this flash drive. After evading the police, Will climbs up the side of a crane. He turns the crane round so it faces the building. When the crane reaches its maximum extension, Will swings the hook so it crashes through a window of the building. Will is running along the top of the crane. He jumps, grabs hold of the building and gets inside.The helicopter is at the helipad, but Ajani discovers that its pilot is an impostor. Mr Pierce reveals to Zhao that he is also an agent of Kores, then pulls out a gun and kills some people around Zhao. Kores and his men come out from a door with machine guns and gun more people down. Zhao asks why doesn't Kores just shoot him and take the drive. Kores responds ""You know I can't do that. The men I work for will kill me if I don't get it back for them. You should've paid me and been done with it. But no. Clever boys like you always think you can be clever. So how's this for clever? I'm going to take you and your drive and your helicopter. And I'm going to make you watch as your building burns to ash, and there's nothing you can do about it."" Ajani gets up and shoots the pilot. The dead pilot falls against the controls, causing the helicopter to crash further into the building. Zhao gets up and runs down a flight of stairs. Kores is shooting his machine gun at him. Zhao runs into the penthouse, and locks its doors down before Kores can get to him.Xia tells Kores she can't open the penthouse doors with the tablet. ""Wait. It looks like Will Sawyer's in the building. And I've got a movement alert. It's his family."" Mr Pierce says ""You're not going to get in using force. You need someone who knows the system. Sawyer, if anyone can get in, it's him. He's in the building. Just need to find him."" Kores answers, ""We don't need to find him. We know what he wants.""Sarah and the children are crossing the bridge. Mr Pierce appears, pulls out a gun and grabs Sarah. Sarah tells the children to do what he says. Mr Pierce agrees ""That's right, listen to your mummy."" Sarah pulls a pair of scissors out of her pocket. She tells the children to run, then stabs the scissors into Pierce's leg and fights with him until he's on the floor. A metal structure falls and smashes the bridge. Burning debris falls, separating Henry and Georgia. Henry tells Georgia to go up to the waterfall. Pierce is back up. He says ""I'm not supposed to kill you, but I think your kids will be enough."" Will appears and pushes Pierce off the edge of the bridge.A wooden plank is placed across the gap where the bridge had been. Sarah has to walk across to get Henry while Will holds the bridge steady. Henry is riding on Sarah's back. Sarah has to jump to Will at the last second, before the plank falls down the gap. There is an elevator that operates on electromagnetic induction. When there's a fire, it's held in place by a fail-safe brake. Will cuts the cable. The elevator falls. The magnets kick back on when it passes the fire line. Sarah pulls the handle to engage the braking system. Sarah and Henry escape from the building and meet Inspector Wu.Two men appear before Georgia saying ""It's okay. We're the good guys."" Georgia only listens to her father. She runs off into the waterfall. The two men follow her. Will fights with these two men before meeting Kores Botha. The people are outside the penthouse doors. Will says the only way the doors open is from the inside, or if the fire alarm on the penthouse level triggers it, but this can't happen because Kores took the entire system offline. Kores says ""Every man has a weakness. It's easy to find. Once you know what he loves, you have it."" Zhao loves this building. Will's weakness is his family. ""Anything can be done with the proper motivation."" Kores says he will throw Georgia off the roof if Will does not bring to him what Zhao is holding behind these doors. They take Georgia with them, leaving Will on the floor.Sarah describes to Wu the man she saw in The Pearl. The police bring up images of people. Sarah recognizes an image of Kores Botha as the man she saw. Why would Kores trap himself in the fire? Why would he cut off his only way out? One of Botha's men had a container with the word ""SIRIN"" on it. The police look up SIRIN and find out that it's a parachute. Sarah concludes that it is likely that they will jump out of the building and land nearby.The subroutine panels that control the doors are behind the turbines. Will smashes open a window, climbs along the side of the building and abseils to the turbines. He gets inside the turbines and cuts a wire. The doors open. Will climbs back up to the building and uses his false leg to stop the doors closing again. Once inside the penthouse, Zhao puts a gun to the back of Will's head. Will tells Zhao he is too close. He grabs the hand holding the gun, kicks Zhao in the leg and is on top of him in an instant. Will says they need to talk.Zhao explains ""His name's Kores Botha. He handles extortion for three powerful crime syndicates. When I began construction on The Pearl, Botha came to me. He said if I didn't pay him, he'll cripple my labor force and keep me from ever completing this place."" Zhao did pay him ""But what he didn't know was that I hid tracking software inside my wire transfer. As Botha laundered my payments through their offshore accounts, I was able to trace every transaction, giving me their bank accounts, their names, their identities. This was my insurance policy. Botha would never be able to extort money from me again. But when the syndicates found out they were compromised, they threatened to destroy Botha if he didn't clean up his mess. If he kills me, the copies I've made will be sent to the authorities. But if he gets his hands on this, the original, he can reverse engineer my tracking software and hide the identities before anyone's the wiser."" Kores started the fire in The Pearl knowing Zhao would take the most valuable thing in the world to him, the flash drive, and run. Will says ""We're going to give Botha what he came here for."" Zhao replies ""As soon as he has the drive, he'll kill us both."" ""Maybe,"" answers Will, ""But he has my daughter. And her life is what matters to me, not mine. I'm taking that drive to the roof. You could either be attached to it or not. It's your choice, Zhao."" Will asks Zhao if he has any duct tape.Kores, his men and Georgia are on the roof. Will and Zhao appear, with Zhao's hands bound with duct tape. Zhao frees his hands from the duct tape, takes the drive and points his gun at Will. ""I can't let you do this."" He orders Will to turn around. ""I want a parachute. You need me alive. A parachute or you get nothing."" Kores orders one of his men to give him his parachute. ""Drop it there.""""Here's what you want?"" says Zhao. ""Go get it."" He tosses the flash drive across the room. Will shouts at Georgia to run. He pulls a sword out from under his shirt and slashes the man in front of him. Zhao shoots at the criminals. The mirrors pop up. The criminals have a hard time distinguishing the real people from the reflected images. They end up shooting the glass in the mirrors. Zhao shoots a goon. Will fights another goon, throwing him to the floor. Will fights a goon, hitting him against a mirror. The other goon grabs Will and they are both lying down on the floor. Will opens the goon's parachute, dragging them across the floor. Will grabs onto a metal rod. The goon's parachute pulls him off the roof. Will finds the flash drive. A thug is shot by Zhao before he can kill Will.Wu leads an attack on an area that is likely to be the drop zone for the parachutists. Inside a police car, Sarah sees Xia about to shoot a police officer. She opens the car door, slamming it into Xia. In the struggle with Xia, Sarah beeps the car's horn, alerting the police. Xia has a strap around Sarah's neck, strangling her. A police officer appears pointing a gun at Xia. Sarah kicks Xia, knocking her out. She picks up the tablet Xia left on the seat.Will orders Kores to turn around. Kores has Georgia. He says if he gets shot, he will drop a grenade and the girl. He orders Will to toss him the drive. Will says before he does so, there is something Kores should know. Kores is looking at a reflection of Will. He is actually behind him. Will uses the element of surprise to kick Kores over the edge and grab Georgia. The grenade explodes, ending Kores's life before he can fall all the way down.Remembering how Will had fixed her phone earlier, Sarah uses the tablet she recovered from Xia to switch the building's control system off, and then on again. As it restarts, the anti-fire measures come back on line. The sprinklers start working again and the fire is extinguished. A helicopter arrives to bring Will, Georgia and Zhao down to safety. Will gives Zhao his flash drive, then the Sawyer family happily reunite, and Wu has a chance to finally meet and greet Will, acknowledging that he was not responsible for the fire in The Pearl. Zhao states his intention to rebuild The Pearl, as we see the tower showing massive fire damage extending from the 96th floor to the top of the building."

She is called for help by Ted Garza, who has been experiencing paranormal activity since moving into his house. While on the phone he reveals that he is living in her childhood home. Hesitant at first, she explains to her colleagues what happened to her during her childhood, then deciding to accept the job in order to make things right.While in New Mexico, Elise stays in her old home with Garza. He tells her that there have been a lot of paranormal incidents happening in the home, mostly in her old bedroom, which he has blockaded and refuses to enter. Elise does a walk through the home that night, using a night vision camera so the other can see what she does. While in her old room she stumbles across Christian's whistle under their bed, which he had lost when he was six. She then also finds a set of keys in her room attached to her father's old uniform and is led to the basement by mysterious sounds where a female ghost appears only visible to the crew. When she is about to touch the ghost she jumps her from behind, steals the whistle, and shouts ""help her"". Elise then informs them that she had seen the ghost before in her teenage years and tells the story of a day she and Christian were cleaning the floor. Elise had heard a noise and checks the laundry room where she saw the female ghost initially. Gerald appears, but doesn't see the ghost. She pleads with him not to abuse her, and grabs his face, revealing to him that he suffers a heart attack and dies in the future. She then runs away from home and abandons Christian.Elise is then seen with her colleagues in a cafe, when two women sit down beside her. Elise recognizes them are both Christian's daughters, her nieces. Christian walks in and recognizes her, he immediately becomes upset and accuses her of lying and abandoning him with their father. Christian storms out, refusing to speak further with Elise. Elise then gives one of the daughters a picture of Christian's whistle to give it to him and to tell him that she found it in their old bedroom.That night, while exploring the house, Elise and Tucker hear the whistle being blown from downstairs. The whistle leads Elise to the basement where she realizes that it's coming from to behind a dead wall. Elise asks a series of questions and it is revealed to Elise that she'll find what she is looking for behind the wall. Elise realizes that the wall is a door and rushes to her bedroom to get the keys. When Elise opens the door, she finds a missing girl who is chained to the wall. Garza then storms in with a gun threatening them, under the influence of Key Face, and leaves to find Specs upstairs after locking them in. Specs then disarms Garza before Garza could kill him and pushes a bookcase over onto him, killing him instantly. The police arrive to rescue the girl and Elise is then brought in for questioning.While being questioned by the police Elise sees the ghost of her niece Melissa in the police station and realizes that her brother and his two daughters have gone to the house to seek the whistle because of its sentimental value to Christian. While there Melissa is lured into the basement by Key Face by pretending to be her father, which attacks her and inserts a key finger into her throat, and Key Face takes away her soul into the Further. Christian and Imogene are trying to find Melissa when Elise comes rushing there and finds her in the secret cellar room where they found the missing girl.

While in the basement Elise sees something in the exhaust vent of the plumbing systems and finds a night gown that belonged to the female ghost, revealing her name to be Anna. When Elise holds the gown she is able to see in a flashback that the day Elise saw Anna in the laundry room she was alive and had escaped from the cellar room where Gerald kept her, similar to Garza. When Gerald walks in the laundry room he did see Anna, but pretended that there was nothing there. Elise also sees that after her younger self had run out of the house her father brutally kills Anna. Coming out of the vision, Elise and Tucker see a string of the gown stretched and tied to a suitcase in the plumbing pipes. Tucker removes the exhaust and Elise goes in to examine the suitcase.

She is met by Anna who takes her to the red door and gives her the whistle, saying she can't go past that point. Elise is then seen locked in a cage, with a collar around her neck, to relive the horror of Gerald beating her as a child for admitting she can see ghosts. She then sees Gerald being dominated by the evil entity which then presents Elise with a cane to beat him and take her revenge. Imogene finds Elise and shouts out to her, she then breaks free by telling Key Face that she will no longer hate and feed him his hatred, snapping the cane. Elise comes to realize that Gerald was the demon's puppet when she hears him use Garza's words of the entity being in his head. Key Face is about to take souls of Imogene and Melissa when Elise offers herself and it stops.

Instant Family,2018,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7401588/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A couple find themselves in over their heads when they foster three children. Feeling a void in their marriage, Pete and Ellie Wanger visit a foster-care center. Two social workers, Karen and Sharon, guide the hopeful parents on the path to becoming adoptive parents.The couples are taken to a fair where they have the chance to go up to kids that they are interested in adopting. Pete and Ellie walk by the teenagers; although Ellie shows hesitance, one teen, Lizzy, informs Ellie that they all now that nobody wants to adopt teenagers. Pete and Ellie talk to Karen and Sharon over potentially taking in Lizzy. The social workers inform the couple that Lizzy's mother is a drug addict who is currently in jail, and she set their house on fire by leaving her crack pipe lit. They also find that Lizzy has two younger siblings, Juan and Lita. Although this seems like more of a challenge for Pete and Ellie, they agree to meet the siblings. Pete and Ellie have Thanksgiving dinner with Ellie's family, who all remark that they have no confidence that the Wagners would be good adoptive parents, until Ellie has enough and decides that they will go through with the foster care to prove that they can be good parents. Approaching middle age, Ellie and Pete Wagner, who flip houses for a living, have never felt it was time to have children--until now. For various reasons including their ages, they contemplate adopting an older child, taking that idea one step further by considering adopting a child in the foster care system for what they believe are altruistic reasons, but in reality is probably more to make themselves feel better by doing something they consider a social good, Pete equating it somewhat to taking in a rescue dog. Thus, they are probably not fully prepared for all it entails. Going through the foster-care training under social workers Karen and Sharon with other couples and singles, they, in meeting a number of foster children at a fair, decide on the spur of the moment to take their adoption idea two steps further, first by thinking of adopting a teenager in meeting feisty 15-year-old Lizzy, and second by adopting more than one child when they discover that Lizzy has two younger siblings, adolescent Juan and preschooler Lita. Beyond the racial issue of the children coming from a Hispanic background and the challenges of dealing with a teenager who already has a developed mind of her own, largely in acting as mother to Juan and Lita in the absence of their own incarcerated mother, they discover that adopting Juan and Lita have their own issues in each having their own but different emotional problems. Aside from the views of their respective families who see what they're doing very differently, Ellie and Paul must not only deal with three children at different stages of their lives and directly with the outward issues each brings into their lives, but with the hidden issues, including Lizzy's manipulations, with motivations that don't always match her outward actions.—Huggo The film starts with Pete (Mark Wahlberg) and Ellie Wagner (Rose Byrne) showing off a fixer-upper of a home to Ellie's sister Kim (Allyn Rachel) and her husband Russ (Tom Segura) that they are trying to flip. The latter couple comment on what a dump the place looks like and how Pete and Ellie won't need a place like that since they don't plan on having kids anytime soon. It leads to an argument between Ellie and Kim due to some competition they have always felt, especially since Kim and Russ have been trying to conceive as well.Pete later comes home from work to find Ellie crying as she is looking up children in foster care on the internet. Pete doesn't want to see it because he thinks he's going to get roped into adopting kids, but when Ellie isn't around, he starts to check the site out himself.The couple later visit a foster care center where two social workers, Karen (Octavia Spencer) and Sharon (Tig Notaro), guide the hopeful parents on the steps to getting into becoming adoptive parents. Among them are a religious couple, a gay couple, and a woman named October (Iliza Schlesinger) who specifically wants a black teenager to turn into a pro athlete. They also listen to a guest speaker named Brenda Fernandez (Eve Harlow), who comes in with the parents that adopted her (Javier Ronceros and Rosemary Dominguez) as a teen and rescued her from a life of abuse since her birth mother and boyfriend were meth heads. Brenda's speech moves the couples into going ahead with the process.The couples are later brought to a fair where they have the chance to go up to kids that they are interested in adopting. Pete and Ellie walk by the teenagers, although Ellie shows hesitance over raising a teen, but one of the teens, Lizzie (Isabela Moner), informs Ellie that they can hear what they are saying.Pete and Ellie talk to Karen and Sharon over potentially taking in Lizzie. The social workers inform the couple that Lizzie's mother is a drug addict who is currently in jail, and she set their home on fire because she left the crack pipe lit. It also turns out that Lizzie has two younger siblings, Juan (Gustavo Quiroz) and Lita (Julianna Gamiz). Pete and Ellie are told that Juan is very sensitive and Lita is highly rambunctious, which is why Lizzie has had to parent them with their mother never around. Although this seems like more of a challenge for Pete and Ellie, they agree to meet the siblings.The Wagners go to the kids' current foster home, where they live with the Muskies (John McConnell and Maureen Brennan). Ellie sits with Lita and plays a game where Lita yells at her doll with racist slurs (obviously picked up from the Muskies), while Pete tries to play basketball with Juan, only to accidentally bounce the ball off the hoop and hit Juan in the face, giving him a bloody nose.Pete and Ellie have Thanksgiving dinner with Ellie's family, where they all make comments about never having confidence in the Wagners adopting kids. Kim and Russ are especially terrible, insinuating that the kids that Pete and Ellie pick out could have been bad influences on their own kids. Ellie has enough and decides that they will go through with the foster care to prove that they can be good parents.Lizzie, Juan, and Lita begin to live with the Wagners. Although it is initially pleasant, it doesn't take long for things to get hectic. Lita refuses to eat anything but potato chips, and Juan reacts sensitively to every instance of trouble. Lizzie is also frequently bratty toward the Wagners, but especially Ellie. The two frequently attend support groups with the other couples for insight on what to do with the kids.Pete's mother Sandy (Margo Martindale) comes to visit to meet the kids. She instantly wins them over by treating the whole family to Six Flags. While there, Lizzie runs off with two friends from school. She doesn't reappear until later after seeing a movie with her friends, so Ellie grounds her for not informing her or Pete as to her whereabouts.The next day, Lizzie has the same friends come over by climbing in through the window. Ellie comes into Lizzie's room to scold her for this, and one of the girls calls her a nazi bitch, so she forces the girls to climb back out the window. Lizzie goes to join the girls, leading Pete and Ellie to follow her and argue with Lizzie. They are momentarily distracted by Juan holding a nail gun, and when Lizzie tells him to put it down, the boy drops it and a nail shoots through his foot. The Wagners take Lizzie's friend's car and rush Juan to the hospital to take the nail out.Karen and Sharon offer solutions to Pete and Ellie for their struggles. They show Lizzie a method for which to handle her outbursts, but Lizzie is familiar with it, so she still acts bratty toward Pete and Ellie. However, Juan and Lita start to warm up to the Wagners. Lita calls Pete ""Daddy"" when he fixes her doll, and Ellie gets a ""Good night, Mommy"" from Juan after she comforts him from a nightmare. Soon, Lizzie starts to go along with the others as they partake in family activities. Pete even invites her to the fixer-upper so they can wreck things for her to take out her frustrations.Pete and Ellie later find out that the kids' mother Carla (Joselin Reyes) has been out of prison for a few months and she wants to see the kids. The Wagners take them to meet with Carla, who thanks them for looking over them, but this upsets Ellie because Carla made it sound like they were babysitting her kids. They express their feelings about this during the group therapy, but the social workers tell them that their main goal is to keep families together. We also hear that October has found a kid, but he's short and white with red hair, which alleviates the tension in the room.Pete and Ellie seek out the Fernandez family for help with Lizzie. They inform the Wagners that Brenda is back in rehab. Ellie snaps because they were the main reason that they went into foster care, but Mrs. Fernandez slaps her for saying that and then tells them what a process it is to really form a bond and trust with the kids. After cooling things over, the Wagners head off.The couple is horrified when they find Lizzie taking naked selfies to send to a guy at school named Jacob (Nicholas Logan), and he sends her a dick pic. When they take the kids to school the next day, they confront a boy named Charlie (Carson Holmes) since they mistook him for Jacob after Ellie thought Lizzie was talking about him during an earlier moment. After realizing they are yelling at a kid who is NOT Jacob, they are even more horrified to find that Charlie points Jacob out to be the janitor. Pete and Ellie chase him into the school and catch him riding a zamboni. Pete punches him in the face and Ellie stomps on his balls. Jacob is arrested, but so are Pete and Ellie, leaving Juan and Lita alone in the car, while Lizzie is humiliated. When Pete and Ellie return home, they are told by Sandy that they need to reassure Lizzie that they love her, because she doesn't feel that she is loved. Ellie also takes this as Sandy feeling similarly, which is why she and Ellie have always had kind of a bumpy relationship. Ellie lets Sandy know she loves her, and vice versa, but Sandy tells the couple to change the statement they wrote for their upcoming court hearing.The Wagners and the kids gather for a court hearing to decide whether or not the kids will go back to Carla or stay with Pete and Ellie. The judge (Valente Rodriguez) reads a statement written by Lizzie detailing the things that Pete and Ellie have done. Although Ellie tries to read her new statement, the judge won't let her. Carla is then asked whether or not she feels ready to reassume care of her children. She hesitates on the last question but says she is ready to be a mother again.Pete and Ellie sadly start to pack things up for the kids. Juan and Lita do not want to go, but Lizzie is ready. Karen and Sharon arrive to the house to inform Lizzie that Carla is not coming to get them. They went to her house and realized that she is still using drugs, and she went back on her word over taking care of them. Heartbroken, Lizzie runs away. Pete and Ellie chase her while Karen and Sharon watch Juan and Lita. Lizzie hides in the backyard of Mrs. Howard (Joan Cusack) and cries. Pete and Ellie tell her they love her, but Lizzie refuses to come out. After Pete and Ellie go back to the house, Lizzie rejoins them. She offers to let Pete and Ellie take Juan and Lita, and that she will just occasionally visit her siblings. Pete and Ellie refuse to let that happen, and they give Lizzie their statement. She realizes they do care about her, and she embraces Pete and Ellie. Mrs. Howard wants a hug too but Ellie declines, although Lita gives her a hug.Four months later, the family goes to a new hearing. This time, the judge clears Pete and Ellie to legally adopt the kids, and all the other foster parents, plus Pete and Ellie's families, are there to cheer them on. Everyone gathers for a big group photo."
Blockers,2018,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2531344/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Three parents try to stop their daughters from losing their virginity on prom night. Single mother Lisa Decker drops off her young daughter, Julie, for her first day of kindergarten. She watches on as Julie is joined by two other girls, Kayla and Sam. Kayla's dad Mitchell and Sam's dad Hunter introduce themselves and become close friends after seeing the bond between their children.. In suburban Chicago, Great Lakes High School seniors Julie, Kayla and Sam, who have been best friends since they met the first day of their school life, are preparing for prom night. The parent that took each to school that first day - Lisa, Mitchell and Hunter respectively - had the potential to match their daughters' friendship, but it has not materialized in quite the same way. Despite brawny, sports-minded Mitchell - who nonetheless is prone to emotional tears - texting her to do things all the time with his wife Marcie, Lisa, the single mom who has devoted her entire being to only offspring Julie, quietly ignores those attempts to be buds for her own personal reasons. Julie and Mitchell don't as quietly ignore overgrown adolescent Hunter's messages, he who they have not kept in touch with since he and Sam's mother, Brenda, split. Hunter has generally been a non-existent part not only of the social circle around their daughters and their daughters' friends, but of Sam's life. Without telling their parents, the three girls have entered into a pact to lose her respective virginity on prom night, each having a different reason for wanting to lose her virginity that night. While Julie wants it to be a special night with her boyfriend of six months Austin, Kayla feels it's a rite-of-passage she will eventually go through, her prom date, Connor, as good a person as any. Sam, still in the closet to everyone, wants to feel part of the crowd and will go along with testing the straight waters with her date Chad, while she truly has her heart for Angelica, who is openly out. As the three couples head off on prom night, Lisa, Mitchell and Hunter learn of their daughters' pact, each who has his or her own reason to try and stop them. Lisa doesn't want Julie to make the same mistake she made with her first, Julie's father - who dropped out of her life shortly after their sexual encounter - that encounter which resulted in Julie. Lisa also does not want to lose Julie, who is the entire focus of her life. Mitchell is not emotionally ready for Kayla to do anything besides the sports related goals to be the best they have worked on together their entire lives. And Hunter, while wanting Sam to have a fun, sexual life, wants her to have it with someone of the correct gender, he deep in his heart knowing of Sam's homosexual orientation. The teen couples and Lisa, Mitchell and Hunter, as two groups, get into one misadventure after another as the parents try to track their daughters and their dates before they feel the girls will be making the biggest mistake of their young lives.—Huggo The film starts with Lisa Decker (Leslie Mann) taking a video of her young daughter Julie (Anniston Almond) as she starts her first day of school. Julie is nervous until she meets Kayla Mannes (Noor Anna Maher) and Sam Lockwood (Hannah Goergen), and the three of them quickly hit it off. Lisa meets Kayla's father Mitchell (John Cena) and Sam's father Hunter (Ike Barinholtz). Lisa and Mitchell get emotional seeing their kids enter school, and Hunter suggests they go for drinks.Fast-forward to the present. Lisa and Julie (now played by Kathryn Newton as a teenager) spend the morning together before Julie goes to school. It's the day of her prom, and Lisa is dreading the fact that soon Julie will be going to college.Mitchell tries to get intimate with his wife Marcie (Sarayu Blue) when he finds a pair of thongs. He puts them in his mouth to tempt her until Marcie reveals they belong to Kayla (now played by Geraldine Viswanathan), at which point he spits them out. Mitchell is very protective of Kayla, even snooping in her room after he finds a cigarette filter in her pants, and then finding a vibrating item that is soon revealed to be part of an electric toothbrush.At school, the girls sit together for lunch. Julie tells the other two that she plans to lose her virginity that night to her boyfriend Austin (Graham Phillips) because she thinks it will be special. Kayla decides to get in on it too with her prom date Connor (Miles Robbins), though she cares less about it being a special thing. Sam (now played by Gideon Adlon) is more hesitant and says she and her prom date Chad (Jimmy Bellinger) might not go that far, but Sam appears more interested in a girl named Angelica (Ramona Young).Julie goes home and finds an acceptance letter from UCLA. She is nervous to tell Lisa since she thinks Julie was planning on going to school there in Chicago only 45 minutes away.At home, Sam gets ready for a pre-prom party at Julie's house. She talks to her mom Brenda (June Diane Raphael) and her African American stepdad Frank (Hannibal Buress). He tells Sam about how prom night is special in terms of being with friends and cherishing these memories. When she gets to the party, Sam tells Julie and Kayla that she wants in on the sex pact.The party starts, and Mitchell talks to Lisa since she hasn't returned his calls to hang out like they used to. Hunter shows up at the party uninvited in a limo that he rented for the girls. Lisa and Mitchell haven't talked to him since he divorced Brenda after he slept with Sam's babysitter, and Sam is none too happy to see him either. Mitchell meets Connor and immediately dislikes him for being near Kayla and for having a man bun.Before the girls leave for prom, Lisa finds Julie's acceptance letter in her drawer. She tries to talk to Julie before she leaves but is unable to work the letter into the conversation. Mitchell and Hunter join Lisa when they hear noises coming from Julie's laptop. They start reading the text messages from the girls' group chat, which is filled with emojis that the adults know are for sexual terms. Their fears are confirmed when Julie writes ""#SexPact2018"", leading them to realize the girls are trying to lose their virginities that night. Lisa and Mitchell vow to stop this from happening, but Hunter thinks they are crazy for trying to do this. Still, he ends up joining them.The parents arrive at the prom to look for the girls. The girls themselves are enjoying the night with their dates, but Sam sees Angelica and strikes up a conversation with her. Angelica says she just broke up with her girlfriend, and she playfully touches Sam's hair, leading her to realize they may have mutual feelings. Sam goes to kiss Chad to see whether or not she truly is straight or gay, and Hunter sees it. Sam clearly didn't enjoy it. Meanwhile, Kayla starts to drink liquor and smoke hash that Connor made. The girls and their dates then leave the prom to head to the after-party.The parents go to Austin's house where Lisa was told that the after-party would be. Instead, the three find Austin's parents, Ron (Gary Cole) and Cathy (Gina Gershon) engaging in prom role play sex. Ron catches Mitchell outside but since he knows him and Lisa, he's not upset. He casually explains what he and his wife do and that Austin knows all about their sex life. They also reveal that the after-party is at a lake house. When Ron and Cathy refuse to give up the address, Mitchell realizes that Marcie may have it.The three go to Mitchell's house to talk Marcie into giving up the address, but she thinks that it's stupid that they are so worried about the girls losing their virginities when it's like a rite of passage for guys. The three manage to distract Marcie long enough to acquire the address to the lake house. Upon arriving there, a couple of guys refuse to let the parents in until they trick Mitchell into doing a beer-chugging challenge. In this case, they get Mitchell to stick a funnel in his ass and chug the beer from there. In the house, Julie and Austin try to find a private room to get intimate, Sam is getting drunk enough to consider sleeping with Chad, and Kayla tries one of Connor's homemade macarons laced with a ridiculous amount of drugs. The cops arrive, forcing everyone to flee. The girls and their dates return to the limo, and the parents chase after them.In the limo, Sam gets sick and vomits on Chad, causing the rest of her friends (and the limo driver) to vomit uncontrollably. The parents are following closely behind until Sam sticks her head out of the sunroof and barfs on Lisa's car, causing her to swerve and drive into a ditch, leaving the car tipped over on its front. The girls go get cleaned up outside a local convenience store when Julie sees how many texts and calls her mom has sent her. She calls Lisa, and they argue over her getting into UCLA and what she's planning to do later, to which Julie snaps that she knows Lisa is afraid of being alone and that Julie is trying to get as far away from her as possible. Lisa becomes upset and then has an argument with Mitchell when she tells him that she avoids hanging out with him because he reminds her of what she's going to lose. Hunter then has a moment when he tells the two that he cheated on Brenda because they had been distant for a while before it happened. They then hatch another plan on how to find the girls.After getting a ride from a friend, the three parents return to Austin's house to find one of his parents' phones to see if he told them where they will be heading next. Mitchell sneaks into the house and sees that Ron and Cathy are engaging in a weird sex game where they are both blindfolded and following each other's scents to find one another. Mitchell is trapped and at risk for getting caught until Hunter enters and forces him to go along with the sex game, ending in Cathy twisting Hunter's balls. They do manage to get a phone and learn that the girls are heading to a hotel.Everyone from prom is at the hotel tearing it up. Austin tells Kayla how upset Julie is, so she takes his room key and goes upstairs to create a romantic set-up for the two of them. Kayla takes Connor into a room so they can get down to business. However, she ultimately decides that she does want the loss of her virginity to be special, so she instead lets Connor go down on her. Sam and Chad go into a room as well, but Sam stops Chad before he can get started as she realizes it's not what she wants. That doesn't stop him from finishing on her despite there being little activity, but he is okay with it.Mitchell starts kicking every door down until he finds Kayla and Connor. He throws Connor at a wall and out the door, which freaks Kayla out until they sit down to talk about what's been going on, and Mitchell being forced to accept that his daughter is grown up and capable of making mature decisions on her own.Lisa sneaks into Julie and Austin's room and sees the romantic set-up from Kayla. She hides under a bed when the two enter the room. Lisa then has to hide behind a TV when she is in danger of being caught, which causes her to get a small electrocution. She sees Julie and Austin dancing together, and she realizes how happy her daughter is. Lisa sneaks out undetected and lets Julie do what she wants.Hunter tracks Sam down and talks to her. Although she is initially unhappy to see him, Hunter comes forward over how he's been a bad parent over the last few years, but that he really does love Sam. She then officially comes out to him, and he is ecstatic that she told him first and not Brenda.The girls reunite downstairs in the lobby. Julie tells her friends that she did it, and while it was painful, quick, and awkward, it was perfect for her. They start dancing, when Sam sees Angelica. She comes out to her friends, who both tell her they love her. They leave her when Angelica approaches them, and Sam confirms their mutual feelings, leading Angelica to kiss her.Meanwhile, Lisa, Mitchell, and Hunter sit at the hotel bar together after the night they had.

Pacific Rim: Uprising,2018,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2557478/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Jake Pentecost, son of Stacker Pentecost, reunites with Mako Mori to lead a new generation of Jaeger pilots, including rival Lambert and 15-year-old hacker Amara, against a new Kaiju threat. It is 2035, 10 years after the Battle of the Breach, in which the inter-dimensional portal created by the Precursors (through which they sent marauding Kaiju) was closed. Former Jaeger pilot Jake Pentecost, son of Battle of the Breach hero Stacker Pentecost, makes a living by stealing and selling Jaeger parts on the black market in the Los Angeles area. After he tracks part of a disabled Jaeger's power core to the secret workshop of 15-year-old Jaeger enthusiast Amara Namani, both are arrested by the Pan-Pacific Defense Corps (PPDC) after an altercation between Amara's small, single-pilot Jaeger Scrapper and the Police Jaeger November Ajax. A holographic transmission of Jake's adoptive sister and PPDC Secretary General Mako Mori persuades him to return to PPDC as an instructor, with Amara as his recruit.. It is 10 years since the world was attacked by creatures from another dimension. The creatures were only defeated by the introduction of Jaegers--massive fighting machines--and the bravery and self-sacrifice of one man, Stacker Pentecost. Now his son Jake is a Jaeger training instructor and finds living up to his father's fame difficult. Earth's peace is about to be shattered as someone is out to unseal the breach and allow the creatures back in.—grantss The film opens ten years after the previous 'Pacific Rim' movie after the so-called the Battle of the Breach, in which humanity defeated the Kaiju monsters by sealing the entrance into our world. Jake Pentecost (John Boyega) is the son of Stacker, but he doesn't see himself as anything like his dad. Jake is a former Jaeger cadet who now makes a living by dealing Jaeger parts in exchange for goods.Jake goes to a decommissioned Jaeger scrapyard with three thugs that he's hustled in search of a very valuable Jaeger core. The thug leader forces Jake at gunpoint to find it to pay off what he stole from him. Jake finds that the core is missing, but his tracker is picking it up. He tricks the thugs into a trap and chases after someone who already has the core. Jake finds that it's an orphan girl, Amara Namani (Cailee Spaeny). As the authorities arrive, Amara boards a Jaeger she built and calls Scrapper, and Jake follows. A Pan-Pacific Defence Corps Jaeger, November Ajax, chases after the two, but Amara pilots Scrapper to get them out. Jake tells her to use one of Scrapper's batteries to disable November, which works briefly, but the two are caught anyway.Jake and Amara are in a cell when Jake is called in to speak to Mako Mori (Rinko Kikuchi), who is the PPDC's General Secretary and Jake's adopted sister. She gives Jake a choice between going to jail or training new Jaeger cadets. Jake makes up his mind, and Mako says he's already set, and that Amara will be a cadet too.The two are sent to the Hong Kong Shatterdome to begin training. Jake meets his former co-pilot in Gipsy Avenger, Nate Lambert (Scott Eastwood), with whom he now has a strained relationship with. Amara then learns that Jake is Stacker's son, as she is a fan of him and Jaegers in general. Jake also meets Jules Reyes (Adria Arjona), a soldier that he becomes attracted to. Nate takes Jake and Amara to meet the other cadets, including Suresh (Karan Brar), Ilya (Levi Meaden), and Viktoria (Ivanna Sakhno), or ""Vik"". She isn't happy that Amara has gotten into the program based off the PPDC being impressed by her building her own Jaeger, when it took Vik three tries to get in.The cadets begin their training by testing out their Drift compatibility. Amara doesn't do well at first and is discouraged. Jake and Nate talk in the kitchen and agree to stay out of each others' way.The Shatterdome is visited by reps from Shao Corporations, including its CEO Liwan Shao (Jing Tian) and Newt Geiszler (Charlie Day), who is now her Head of Research and Development. Their plan is to quickly deploy a large number of Jaeger drones around the world, which is viewed as a threat to the PPDC. Newt reunites with Hermann Gottlieb (Burn Gorman), who brings him to the PPDC's research lab to show him a vial of Kaiju blood, which may be essential in the development of the drones in making thruster pods. Hermann also tells Newt that he still has nightmares of when they drifted with the Kaiju brain. Newt then leaves to go reunite with Liwen, who tells him to stay away from Hermann so that she doesn't have to question his loyalty.Mako tells Jake how she doesn't trust the drone program because they are remote-operated and could be compromised or hacked. She tells him that she had it authorized for Jake to co-pilot Gipsy Avenger at an upcoming meeting in Sydney.Gipsy Avenger gets deployed in Sydney with Jake and Nate co-piloting. Suddenly, a rogue Jaeger, Obsidian Fury, rises from the ocean and begins to attack. Jake and Nate operate Gipsy to fight back. In the chaos, a chopper with Mako on-board is struck by Obsidian, and although Gipsy tries to rescue her, they just miss her, and the chopper crashes to the ground. Obsidian returns to the water.Jake returns to the PPDC, mourning Mako's loss. He meets with Amara, who offers her condolences. In order to help her out, Jake drifts with Amara, and he sees a memory of hers. She was on a boardwalk with her parents and brother when a Kaiju began to attack. When Amara tried to reach her family, they were crushed by the Kaiju. Jake has to snap her out of it and remind her not to hold on to the memory.At the Shao headquarters, Newt learns from Liwen that the drone program has been authorized in the wake of the Sydney attack. Newt considers the timing of this to be inconvenient. He returns home and starts talking to someone he calls Alice. Turns out ""Alice"" is a Kaiju brain in a pod that Newt frequently drifts with.At the PPDC, Amara and Vik get into a fight, with Amara actually managing to overpower Vik despite being half her size. The fight is broken up immediately by Nate. Jules enters to tell him that Hermann deciphered Mako's final message. It's the location of an old Jaeger facility in Zemlya where Obsidian may be operated from.Jake and Nate ride Gipsy to the facility, where Obsidian attacks again and destroys the facility. The two manage to overpower Obsidian this time and rip out its central core. Gipsy pulls off Obsidian's head to reveal that it was being operated by a Kaiju brain.Amara and a few cadets sneak into the wreckage of Obsidian Fury. Upon inspection, Amara finds a tube with a Shao logo on it. As she cuts into it, it leaks acid that severely burns another cadet's arm. She is subsequently kicked out of the program, to her disappointment. After she expresses that she doesn't belong, Jake tells her not to let what other people think of her define her. As Amara leaves, the other cadets express their regret, and Vik sincerely tells her to build her next Jaeger bigger.The drones are set to be deployed to PPDC Shatterdomes around the world. However, they are quickly taken over by Kaiju brains, making them look like Jaeger-Kaiju hybrids. They begin to attack the Shatterdomes, killing many and wrecking almost all the other Jaegers. Hermann rushes to find Newt to stop this, but when they reach the lab, Newt initiates a program in the drones to prepare them to open Breaches around the world to unleash more Kaiju. Newt has been planning this for the last decade after his mind has been corrupted by Precursors (Kaiju creators) after drifting with the Kaiju brains for so long. Hermann tries to stop him, but Newt gets away. The drones begin to open the Breaches, and Kaiju start to crawl out from the ocean depths. Liwen manages to shut the drones down and keep the Breaches closed, but three Kaiju have successfully gotten out and are making their way into Japan.In the lab, Hermann and the others determine that the Kaiju are headed to Mt. Fuji because it contains rare earth elements, and when mixed with Kaiju blood, will create a violent reaction that sets off the Ring of Fire and activates all nearby volcanoes to destroy humanity and bring forth more Kaiju. The PPDC gets set on bringing in reinforcements to repair Jaegers and get the cadets ready for battle.Jake and Nate meet with the cadets and prepare them with a speech from Jake, much like his father did in the past. He and Nate board Gipsy Avenger, while Amara joins Vik and another cadet in Bracer Phoenix, along with Guardian Bravo and Saber Athena joining. They lift off using Hermann's rocket thrusters with the Kaiju blood and rare earth elements as fuel.The three Kaiju are already attacking the city. The Jaegers arrive and start fighting back. Unfortunately, Newt uses his tech to merge the beasts into one Mega-Kaiju. This one proves to be insanely powerful, causing casualties within Guardian and Saber. It manages to overpower all the Jaegers before it starts heading toward Mt. Fuji. Nate is severely injured, and Bracer is down as well. Nate ejects himself to allow Amara to join Jake for them to co-pilot Gipsy. Liwen arrives with Scrapper and uses the last rocket to help Gipsy head toward Mt. Fuji.The Mega-Kaiju moves closer and closer toward the volcano. The cadets decide the only way to stop it is to send Gipsy soaring right into it. Once they reach a high enough altitude, Gipsy is sent hurtling toward the beast. Jake and Amara struggle to free themselves, but Scrapper gets them out in time. Gipsy collides powerfully with the Mega-Kaiju, sending it rolling down the mountain until it dies. Newt tries to initiate Plan B, only to get knocked out by Nate. Jake and Amara land safely and celebrate their victory.The last scene shows Newt in custody, vowing revenge and swearing that the Kaiju will return and that the Precursors will destroy the world. Jake enters and promises that humanity will be ready to fight back, bigger and badder than ever."

She heads to East Asia, where adventure and danger await.—grantss The film opens with the voice of Lord Richard Croft (Dominic West) telling the legend of an ancient sorceress named Himiko. The story goes that she held power over life and death, and one touch from her was enough to kill anyone. Her generals overthrew her and buried her body on the island of Yamatai to prevent her evil from spreading. Richard plans to learn more about Himiko's secrets, but he fears leaving his daughter behind.We jump to the present where Lara Croft (Alicia Vikander) is at a boxing gym somewhere in London, England. She tries her hardest against her opponent but must ultimately tap out. Lara is later told by the gym's owner that she's behind on payments and he can't keep letting her show up without paying. Lara then heads to another location with some friends of hers that challenge her to a ""fox hunt"" - Lara is supposed to carry a fox tail on the back of her bike while a team of bikers chase after her. Lara rides through the streets and narrowly evades the bikers until she spots a man on the streets that she believes to be Richard. This distracts her and causes her to run into a police car, leading to her arrest.Lara is bailed out by her former guardian and her father's old business partner Ana Miller (Kristin Scott Thomas). She tells Lara that her father's shares of his company are about to be sold off unless Lara claims them herself. Lara has spent the last seven years waiting and hoping Richard will return home, but everyone has figured he died.In the morning, Lara goes to her father's company to claim her inheritance when she is presented with a puzzle box like one she used to play with as a child. Inside is a message and a key from Richard that directs her to go to the family's tomb. Lara opens her parents' tomb and finds a room full of her father's research. She finds a video camera with a message from Richard, detailing his search for Himiko's tomb and the history of her legend. He requested that Lara destroy all of his research because a company called Trinity is after his work and may threaten the world if they find Himiko's tomb.Lara goes to a pawn shop to get money for an amulet that belonged to Richard. She only gets £10,000 (pounds) at first, and when she tries to get more, the greedy shop owner, Max (Nick Frost), knocks it down to £8,000. Lara then knocks coffee on his balls for being a jerk.Lara travels to Hong Kong to find a ship captain named Lu Ren (Daniel Wu). She arrives at the docks and has her bag stolen by three street punks. Lara catches up to them and manages to get her bag back, but one of the goons tries to take it back with a knife. Lara manages to run by Lu Ren's boat, where he scares the punks off with a rifle, but also because he is drunk. After passing out, Lara wakes him up and learns that her father went off with Lu Ren's father and they both disappeared. She requests that they sail to Yamatai to find out just what happened to them, and she gives him the money she earned as payment.On the journey to the island, the pair encounter a ferocious storm. Knowing the ship won't survive, Lara and Lu hop off and try to get on a lifeboat, but Lara ends up being washed away to an island where she is knocked out by a mercenary.Lara wakes up to meet a man named Mathias Vogel (Walton Goggins). He has been leading an expedition for Trinity to find Himiko's tomb, but hasn't been able to return home to his family until he has concluded his search and brought back what they want. Vogel claims to have killed Richard and then forces Lara and Lu to work for him and his mercs to locate the tomb. They, along with a whole group of workers, are put under hard labor, and when one man falls behind due to exhaustion, Vogel shoots him dead.Lu gives Lara a chance to run when he knocks out one of the mercs. They chase after Lara, who ends up falling in the river and is almost swept away over the falls until she hangs on to a crashed airplane hanging over the falls. The plane starts to break when Lara finds a parachute and manages to pull it as she falls. She crashes down into the forest and is seriously injured when she gets something stuck in her abdomen.Vogel sends one of his mercs to find Lara, just as they have found the tomb's location, but still need someone to unlock it for them. The merc finds Lara, but after a fight, she kills him and is mortified at what she's done. She then sees a mysterious figure in the woods and follows him to his hideout. To her surprise, it is Richard, very much alive. Although he believes Lara to be a hallucination at first, he knows it's her and they tearfully reunite. Richard patches up her wound and is upset to find out Lara didn't burn his research as he requested, and now Trinity is closer to Himiko. Despite his refusal to fight back, Lara takes a bow and some arrows to head back to the camp.Lara uses the bow and arrows against Vogel's goons before reaching Vogel himself. She helps Lu Ren and the other workers get away, and Richard ends up going to the tomb as well. Before Lara can kill Vogel, he draws his gun on Richard, and although Richard tells Lara to go ahead and kill Vogel, she cannot bring herself to do so out of concern for Richard's safety. Lara is then forced to solve the puzzle on the tomb that allows it to open.Vogel leads a team of his men, plus Lara and Richard, into the tomb. They come across a few booby traps that brings the party down, including another puzzle that Lara has to solve before they all fall to their deaths. They finally find Himiko's casket and open it, where her body lies and quickly decays. The men attempt to lift her corpse, but one of the mercs finds himself infected and quickly decomposing, even causing him to shoot some of them men in a frenzy before Vogel puts him out of his misery. The Crofts realize that Himiko wasn't using her powers for evil, but she had voluntarily chosen to be buried to prevent the sickness within her from spreading. Vogel cuts off Himiko's finger and places it in a bag so that he can bring it back. Richard is then attacked by one of Vogel's infected soldiers, and although he manages to kill him, Richard touched his face and is now dying of the infection. He decides he must destroy the tomb with bombs in order to prevent the sickness from spreading. He shares one last goodbye with Lara before she goes off to find Vogel.Lara reaches Vogel before he crosses the bridge back out. They fight, just as Richard detonates the explosives and starts to bring the tomb down. Lara takes the finger bag from Vogel's pocket and stuffs it down his throat. The infection in his body spreads, and Lara kicks him down a chasm. She leaps across to the other side and manages to get to the end of the tomb but is trapped under the rubble. Thankfully, Lu Ren is nearby and he helps her out. They then see a Trinity chopper descend and they force the men to take them and the workers home.Upon returning to London, Lara claims her inheritance. She looks over all the companies owned by her father, including the parent company of Trinity. She realizes that Ana is the head of this company and was directly involved with Vogel the whole time. Lara decides to continue her father's work and bring down the bad guys.The last scene sees Lara returning to the pawn shop where she purchases two twin pistols."

Thomas, Newt, and Frypan are the last of the free ""Gladers"" immune to the Flare virus that has ravaged the world's population. They and The Right Arm resistance conduct a rescue operation where they retrieve other Immunes from a train, which is owned by WCKD, an organization responsible for capturing and experimenting on immune children. They discover that Minho, their remaining Glader friend whom WCKD had captured, was not on that train, which is headed to ""The Last City"", WCKD's base of operations. Against the orders of Vince, leader of The Right Arm, the three leave their camp to rescue Minho, who is being tortured by WCKD in hopes of developing a cure for the virus. Heading for the Last City, the group is attacked by Cranks, humans infected with the Flare. However, they are saved by Jorge and Brenda, who join them.. This third 'Maze Runner' film opens some time after the 'Scorch Trials' film with the Gladers chasing after a WCKD train to rescue Minho (Ki Hong Lee) and other captured children. Thomas (Dylan O'Brien) and Vince (Barry Pepper) attempt to board the train while Jorge (Giancarlo Esposito) and Brenda (Rosa Salazar) fend off WCKD mercenaries. Thomas and Vince hop on and separate the cart with the captives away from the main train. When the villains realize what happened, they try to run back to kill the Gladers. Fortunately, Newt (Thomas Brodie-Sangster) and some members of The Right Hand were hiding nearby, and they hijack a WCKD jet and manage to carry the cart off the train and back to their hideout.Upon arriving at the hideout, Thomas discovers that Minho isn't with the ones they rescued as he had believed. Newt and Frypan opt to go with Thomas to go find him, even though Vince and Jorge want everyone to stay together.Janson (Aiden Gillen) finds Minho at the train site. When they bring him back to WCKD headquarters, Minho is put in a virtual reality simulation where he finds himself in the same maze he started in. He runs through it and finds himself being chased by a Griever. Minho is cornered by the Griever in the simulation while WCKD scientists are extracting his blood for finding a cure for the Flare virus. Overseeing all of this is Ava (Patricia Clarkson) and Teresa (Kaya Scodelario), the latter who feels remorse for betraying Thomas and the others at the end of the previous film.Meanwhile, Thomas, Newt, and Frypan drive through a tunnel past an infection checkpoint where they encounter Cranks. Their car flips over and nearly traps them, but Frypan emerges with a rifle to start shooting at the Cranks before they can attack. An even larger number of Cranks approach before the guys are saved by Jorge and Brenda. They proceed toward the Last City until they notice it is guarded by a massive wall to keep the infected out.Ava and Teresa meet with WCKD board members to discuss the matter of the wall and their progress in creating a serum for the virus. Ava requests that they allow her and the scientists to begin performing trials. Despite their hesitation, Teresa steps in and gives good reasoning for going ahead with the trials.The group arrives outside the city to see a crowd of infected protesters gathered by the wall. Within moments, guards start to fire upon the protesters using enormous blasters. Thomas and his friends run from the chaos and are taken by masked men. After being brought to a safe spot, Jorge starts beating one of the masked men. The man reveals himself to be Gally (Will Poulter), previously thought to have been dead. Thomas punches him in the face as payback for Gally killing Chuck. Gally apologizes for what he did as he had been infected at the time. He offers the group a chance to help them.Gally leads the group to the home of an infected rebellion leader named Lawrence (Walton Goggins), whose face is disfigured as a result of the virus. Lawrence offers Thomas a way to sneak into the city on the condition that he helps him out as well. Thomas agrees and travels through a secret passage with Newt and Gally while the others stay behind.At a lab, Teresa tests out Minho's blood on a young infected girl named Cheyenne (Shai Lun Choo). Teresa then goes to Minho's cell to tell him what she's doing. He pulls her in and attacks her for being a traitor before guards come in to sedate him. Teresa goes back to find that Cheyenne's condition has worsened, as she is now in a Crank-like state.At the hideout, Gally shows Thomas and Newt that their only way into the WCKD facility is through Teresa. Thomas is hesitant in going through with it, which Newt thinks is because Thomas still has feelings for Teresa. Newt gets angry with Thomas until he gets calmed down. Outside, Newt reveals to Thomas that he got infected in the tunnels, but he doesn't want anyone else to know about it just yet.Thomas manages to get Teresa to spot him on the streets, leading her to follow him into an alley where Gally captures her. She is brought before the group to convince her that they need to get inside the facility, and Teresa says they need her fingerprint.Thomas, Newt, Gally, and Teresa all head toward the facility. Gally goes to find a serum and the immune children while the others go look for Minho. They find and finally free him, and they head to escape, but are found by Janson and several guards.

Frypan helps pull the bus away with a crane, but it becomes too heavy and falls away from WCKD. Thomas, Newt, and Minho are forced to jump out a window and into a pool to get away from Janson.Lawrence gathers his army of infected people as they head to take the city back. Lawrence rides a van with explosives into the side of the wall, causing a huge explosion that allows the army to storm in. Soon, the whole city is under siege. Meanwhile, Newt starts to get worse, turning more into a Crank. He gives Thomas a necklace with a cylinder before he passes out. Teresa broadcasts her voice over the speakers to call to Thomas, saying they need his blood for the cure since it was his blood that helped cure Brenda when she was sick. Moments later, Newt reawakens in a Crank-like state, begging Thomas to kill him as he starts to attack. Thomas defends himself against Newt until he is forced to put a knife in Newt's heart. Newt dies, and the others gather around him as Thomas heads back to WCKD with great remorse.Thomas finds Ava, and he aims his gun at her. She attempts to help him, only to get shot dead by Janson. He takes Thomas to a room where Teresa is preparing to extract his blood. When Janson says that WCKD will only cure those they deem fit, Teresa whacks him over the head, and she tries to help Thomas get out. Thomas then starts to fight Janson. Before Janson can finish them, Thomas throws a weight at a cell door holding two Cranks. They break out and start to maul Janson to death. Thomas and Teresa head to the top of the building, but Thomas was just shot by Janson. Jorge rides a jet to the top with Brenda, Vince, and Gally. Teresa helps Thomas jump to safety. Before she can go, the building next to the facility collapses in the chaos of the rebellion. The adjacent building comes down on WCKD, causing it to crumble and collapse, taking Teresa with it. Thomas looks on in sadness as he watches her fall to her death.A while later, the survivors have made it to an island, a safe haven that Ava had mentioned. They make it their new home. Minho gives Thomas the necklace that Newt gave him earlier. Inside is a note from Newt to Thomas, reflecting on their entire ordeal and thanking him for being a friend, but also requesting that he takes care of himself and everyone else. The survivors then start to carve the names of their lost loved ones onto a rock. Thomas carves the names of Chuck, Newt, and Teresa.The final shot shows Thomas walking along the beach alone, holding the serum in his hands as he looks out into the distance."
The Nutcracker and the Four Realms,2018,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5523010/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A young girl is transported into a magical world of gingerbread soldiers and an army of mice. All Clara (Mackenzie Foy) wants is a one-of-a-kind key that will unlock a box that holds a priceless gift from her late mother. A golden thread presented to her at godfather Drosselmeyer's (Morgan Freeman's) annual holiday party, leads her to the coveted key which promptly disappears into a strange and mysterious parallel world. It's there that Clara encounters a soldier named Phillip (Jayden Fowora-Knight), a gang of mice, and the regents who preside over three Realms: Land of Snowflakes, Land of Flowers, and Land of Sweets. Clara and Phillip must brave the ominous Fourth Realm, home to the tyrant Mother Ginger (Dame Helen Mirren), to retrieve Clara's key and hopefully return harmony to the unstable world. On Christmas Eve, citizens of Victorian London are celebrating the arrival of the holiday. This movie begins after the passing of Marie Stahlbaum (Anna Madeley) as her husband and children Louise (Ellie Bamber), Clara (Mackenzie Foy), and Fritz (Tom Sweet) attempt to celebrate the holiday in the midst of such tragedy. Mr. Stahlbaum (Matthew Macfadyen) bestows each of the children a gift from their late mother: Marie's favorite gown for Louise, a set of toy soldiers for Fritz, and a mysterious egg-shaped contraption for Clara with a note telling her that ""everything she needs is inside."" Clara attempts to open the box, but realizes that the key to unlocking the contraption is missing. As Louise helps her younger sister prepare for their godfather Drosselmeyer's (Morgan Freeman's) annual holiday gala, she notices her godfather's initials on the detailing and realizes that Drosselmeyer might know how to open it. The Stahlbaum family arrive at Drosselmeyer's mansion and Mr. Stahlbaum sternly forbids Clara to wander off by herself, since he has promised both of his daughters a dance during the festivities. Clara disobeys her father and seeks Drosselmeyer's workshop. After helping him fix one of his latest inventions, Drosselmeyer examines Clara's egg and tells her that she is the only one clever enough to open it. He sends Clara back upstairs with the promise of meeting up with her shortly. In Victorian England, teenager Clara is a young scientist that lives with her older sister Louise, her younger brother Fritz, and her widower father Mr. Stahlbaum. The family misses their mother and wife Marie Stahlbaum, who was also a scientist and has recently passed away. On Christmas Eve, Mr. Stahlbaum delivers a gift left by Marie for each sibling and Clara receives an egg-shaped locked box without a key to open it. The family goes to the ball promoted by Clara's godfather Drosselmeyer, who is also a man of science, to spend the night and she asks him for the key. When Mr. Drosselmeyer delivers his gifts to each child he is hosting, Clara crosses the boundary of a world created by her mother, where Clara is a princess, and ruled by the regents of the realms Land of Snowflakes, Land of Flowers, and Land of Sweets that protect them from Mother Ginger, who is the tyrant of the Fourth Realm in the beginning of an adventure full of fantasy and betrayal.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil In London, England one Christmas Eve, Mr. Stahlbaum gives his children Christmas presents to fulfill his wife's dying wish. Clara, the youngest sister, receives a handcrafted egg-shaped box, which, to her dismay, she is unable to unlock. In the package, she discovers a note from her mother that states that the inside of the egg contains all she would ever need.The Stahlbaum family then heads to a Christmas Eve ball, hosted by the children's godfather, Drosselmeyer. Refusing to dance with her father, Clara scurries from the crowd to ask Drosselmeyer, a skilled engineer, how to unlock her egg. He then reveals to Clara that the egg was a creation of his that he gifted to Clara's mother when she was younger, and that her mother's wish was to bestow the gift to her daughter.Returning to the ballroom, Clara gets scolded by her father for disobeying him and not dancing with him. Calling him self-absorbed and obsessed with his family's image since his wife's passing, she flees the group when Drosselmeyer announces it being time for the children to receive their gifts. Clara finds her string with her name on it, signifying her gift, and follows it into a parallel world to Christmas Tree Forest, where the key hangs in the center of a tree waiting for her to grab. Nonetheless, before she can grab it, a mouse snatches it. Unable to reach the mouse which crosses a frozen-over lake, Clara approaches Captain Philip Hoffman, who tells her that she is the daughter of Queen Marie Stahlbaum, to cross the bridge he is guarding, which leads to the Fourth Realm. Captain Philip and Clara cross the bridge, but they are unable to obtain the key from the mice.Captain Philip then guides Clara to the palace, where she meets The Sugar Plum Fairy, regent of the Land of Sweets; Shiver, regent of the Land of Snowflakes; and Hawthorne, regent of the Land of Flowers. Hawthorne then divulges to Clara that they are at war with the the Land of Amusements, which they now refer to as ""the Fourth Realm.""Watching a ballet that tells the story of the world's creation, Sugar Plum explains to Clara that her mother created this world as a young girl. She later explains that Marie animated everyone with a machine that can turn toys into humans. Sugar Plum says that she can use this machine to defend the other three realms against Mother Ginger, regent of the Fourth Realm, but it needs a key. Clara investigates the machine and notices that the key hole matches that of the one on her egg: the same key snatched by the mouse. Clara and her soldiers go on a journey toward Mother Ginger and the mice to get the key back and are successful. However, Clara is disappointed upon finding out that the egg is only a music box.Once Sugar Plum obtains the key, she uses the machine to turn toys into life-size soldiers that obey her every command, including that to attack the Fourth Realm. She also reveals that the machine can turn people into toys as well. Clara suggests that she use the soldiers as defense rather than violence, as it is what her mother would have wanted, but Sugar Plum declares that what her mother would have wanted is irrelevant since she is dead. Infuriated by Clara's resistance, Sugar Plum imprisons Clara, Captain Philip, Shiver, and Hawthorne.Opening her egg-shaped music box, Clara discovers that the top flips to reveal a mirror, illustrating that all she needed was herself. She and the other prisoners escape, eluding being caught. She and Captain Philip are then greeted by one of Mother Ginger's mice who guides them away from the threat. The mouse shows Clara an entry into the machine's room and guides Captain Philip to Mother Ginger to convince her to help Clara overthrow Sugar Plum.Clara successfully enters the machine's room and shuts down the machine while fighting off soldiers, causing the palace's water wheels to cease rotating, catching Sugar Plum's attention. Mother Ginger comes to her aid and helps her to fight off the soldiers. Sugar Plum ultimately traps Mother Ginger and attempts to turn her into a toy with the machine. However, while distracted by Mother Ginger, Sugar Plum was unaware that Clara had tinkered with the machine so that it aimed at Sugar Plum. The machine zaps Sugar Plum and turns her into a porcelain doll as punishment for high treason to the realms, and Mother Ginger remains alive.Thanked for restoring peace among the realms, Clara promises to visit the realms in the future and returns back to London, where time has hardly passed since she left. She then approaches her father and acknowledges how hard everything has been for everyone since Marie's passing while asking him to dance. He accepts, and Clara opens her music box when her father becomes flooded with emotions; as the song that plays was the first song that he and Clara's mother had ever danced to. The two then continue to dance throughout the night."

However, when Sean isn't there, Emily notes that Sean hasn't written a thing since the first book 10 years ago, and that they are close to bankruptcy.While taking the boys to the park, Stephanie snaps a photo of Emily for the school's yearbook. Emily firmly orders Stephanie to delete the photo, and does not explain why. Stephanie meekly obliges. At Emily's house, the two have martinis and trade secrets. Emily tells Stephanie of how she and her husband got into a threesome with Sean's teaching assistant a few months earlier. Stephanie then tells a secret of how, after her father passed away when she was a high school senior, she met a son he had from another relationship named Chris (Dustin Milligan). In her grief, Stephanie turned to Chris, and the two wound up having sex, leading a shocked Emily to call Stephanie a ""brother fucker"".Emily calls Stephanie and asks her for ""a simple favor"" to pick up Nicky from school because she has to take care of some work business, while Sean has gone to London to look after his injured mother. Stephanie obliges, but she can't get in touch with Emily. After two days, Emily hasn't come for Nicky. Stephanie calls Emily's job and is told that Emily flew to Miami to handle something, which she didn't mention to anyone, even Sean. Stephanie gets in touch with Sean to inform him, and he isn't surprised that Emily has left Nicky with her. He says that when Emily knows Nicky is with someone taking care of him, she will disappear for a few days. He returns home the next day for Nicky, and when Stephanie tells him that her assistant is unable to get in touch with Emily either, they speak to the police about Emily, who has been gone for three days. The police imply that she has left on her own because of marital troubles and Sean later tells Stephanie that Emily deleted his Facebook account once when he posted a photo of her.Stephanie takes it upon herself to find out what happened to Emily. She goes to Emily's work in New York City and meets her overbearing boss, designer Dennis Nylon (Rupert Friend), who rudely dismisses Stephanie's concerns and insults her outfit. Stephanie sneaks into Emily's office and finds a black-and-white photocopy of an unflattering photo of Emily with ""Gotta have faith"" written on it. Stephanie is spotted on her way out of the office and Dennis threatens her, but Stephanie remembers hearing Emily speaking brashly to Dennis, and Stephanie hits back with some sass of her own to get Dennis to back off. Stephanie then uses the photo of Emily to make missing fliers. Detective Summervile (Bashir Salahuddin) later visits Sean to inform him that Emily was not on any flights to Miami but that she rented a car from LaGuardia Airport the day she disappeared.Stephanie wraps up her original video posted after Emily had been missing for five days, updating her viewers with details about Emily's rental car. After a few days of Emily being gone, Stephanie's viewership has increased, and one of Stephanie's vlog viewers sends her a message stating that she may have spotted Emily driving in Michigan. Authorities go by a lake where the car was spotted, and sure enough, they fish the car out of the lake, as well as Emily's body. Sean is called in to identify the body, and he breaks down.A funeral is held for Emily. Nicky and Miles get into a fight when Miles says that Emily is in heaven, and Nicky yells at Stephanie, claiming that she's trying to be his new mom, and Nicky yells at his father that he is a loser as his mother said. Sean reacts angrily but Stephanie ably defuses the situation. After the reception, Stephanie and Sean console each other, which leads to the two of them having sex.Stephanie speaks with Detective Summervile and is in disbelief when told that Emily's autopsy showed that she not only had severe liver damage from alcohol abuse, but heroin in her body and track marks on her arms and between her toes from injecting heroin. She informs him that the couple fought about money like most married people do. Detective Summervile also tells her that Sean took out a $4 million life insurance policy on Emily right before she died. Stephanie insists they are looking in the wrong direction by investigating Sean, and that Dennis Nylon is way more suspicious. The detective explains that Nylon contacting them telling them that Stephanie had more information than she was revealing.Stephanie goes by the college where Sean works and sees him getting very friendly with his attractive young teaching assistant. At dinner, Nicky insists he saw his mom that day at school, and when told by Sean that he merely thinks he saw her, Nicky retorts that she spoke to him and told him to say hi to Stephanie.Growing suspicious, she asks Sean about the life insurance, which Sean says was Emily's idea after learning that Stephanie lives off her husband's insurance, so they were thinking about Nicky in case something happened to either of them. He also tells Stephanie a story about the ring that was found on Emily's finger. It belonged to his mother and was the only piece of jewelry she cared about, and although Emily claimed she had given it to her and wanted Emily to have it, Emily in fact stole it. While visiting his mother in London, the ring disappeared, and on the plane ride back to New York, Emily announced she had found it. A relieved Sean is shocked when Emily reveals she has no intention of giving it back and actually stole it, and that there was no point for his mother to take such a beautiful ring to the grave. She tells him to choose her or his mother. They would later go into the airplane bathroom where Nicky was conceived. When Stephanie tells him she knows about his threesome, he tells her that Emily was a pathological liar and that it never happened.Shortly after, Sean convinces Stephanie to move in. After Stephanie empties Emily's clothes from her large walk-in closet, she is startled to see all of Emily's items suddenly returned to their same spots. Stephanie begins to believe that Emily is a spirit who is worried about being replaced. While she is driving the boys home from school, Nicky gives Stephanie an envelope that he says is from Emily. Stephanie opens it and finds a picture of Stephanie with her family and Chris, with ""brother fucker"" written on it. Stephanie then receives a phone call from Emily, mocking her, and tells her to kiss Sean 4 million times for her.Stephanie thinks back to telling Emily about the day her husband, Davis, and brother, Chris, were killed. Davis confronted her on her close relationship with Chris and his affection toward Miles, and demanding to know whether Miles was his son or Chris's. She tells him he is talking crazy but does not answer the question. The two men then drive off in Davis' Camaro for a ""man-to-man"" talk, only to be killed. When Stephanie tearfully recounts her guilt, she and Emily end up kissing.Stephanie continues to dig into Emily's history. She takes the nude portrait of her, which she had said was painted by a former lover, and sees from the signature that it was painted by a woman. She tracks down the artist, Diana Hyland (Linda Cardellini), who claims that she was once in a romantic relationship with Emily, but her name was really Claudia. Diana was on the verge of a burgeoning career and starting to sell her work before she fell in love with her. She began painting nudes of exclusively and it ruined her career. Diana says ""Emily"" was a con artist who scammed her out of money after Diana paid off her student loans and college debts, and then she disappeared completely. Diana then gives Stephanie the one thing Emily left, which is a T-shirt for a Bible camp called Squaw Lake in Michigan. She warns her not to investigate Emily's past.Stephanie visits the camp and gets old books with pictures from past campers. In the book from 1996, she finds many pictures of twins Hope and Faith McLanden. After contacting numerous people with the name McLanden, Stephanie manages to find Hope and Faith's mother, Margaret (Jean Smart). Stephanie disguises herself as a cleaner and then sits down to ask Margaret about her daughters. She describes the two of them as being trouble, especially Faith. Stephanie shows Margaret the picture she found in Emily's office and confirms that the woman in the photo is Faith. It turns out that when Hope and Faith were 16, they burned down the east wing of their home with their father inside, and the two vanished without a trace.Now that she's onto something, Stephanie makes a vlog calling out to Emily, forcing her to reveal herself as being alive. She ""updates"" her viewers about how, to get closure, she went to Michigan to find out all about Emily's life, sharing photos from the Bible camp. She says the photos helped her feel as close as a twin to Emily, before closing with a message to Emily is, telling her that she's ""gotta have Faith"" wherever she is. Emily meets a shocked Sean at the restaurant they always go to on their anniversary. Emily expresses her disdain that Sean had sex with Stephanie in their home, and appears to threaten Sean with a gun, only to pull the trigger and reveal the gun wasn't loaded.Emily meets Stephanie in the cemetery by her own grave. Emily tells Stephanie her side of the story, although a flashback reveals what Emily ISN'T saying. Emily, who is really Hope, and her twin sister, Faith, burned the east wing of their house with their father inside because he was abusive. She notes that she was actually a triplet, but their sister Charity was stillborn. After the fire, they ran away from home and planned to meet up elsewhere, but Faith never showed up. After 16 years, Faith contacted Emily to meet up at the camp, where Emily found that Faith has become a heroin addict. Faith tried to blackmail Emily, and Emily drowned her in the lake and used her body to be found so that Sean and Nicky can get the life insurance money since they were broke. Back in the present, despite Emily stating that Faith's death was a suicide, Stephanie knows it was murder. Emily then accuses Stephanie of not being fully honest regarding her relationship with Chris, implying that he is Miles's real father. A flashback shows that Stephanie's husband Davis (Eric Johnson) was also suspicious as well, and that he took Chris on the car ride that ended their lives. Additionally, Emily plays a recording of her conversation with Sean in the restaurant, where he says that Stephanie meant nothing to him and that he thought of Emily during sex.Stephanie then brings in an insurance lawyer, who tells Sean that since it was discovered that Emily had a twin, the insurance company is hesitant to pay the full amount, especially since it is a large amount of money.Emily steals a wrench and tosses it into the air so that it hits her in the eye. She walks into a police station to make it look like Sean beat her and forced her to fake her death, as part of a scheme to frame Sean for insurance fraud. Sean is investigated and later taken into custody but released on bail.Stephanie then plans with Sean to get Emily to confess to the murders of her father and sister. Stephanie comes in with a gun and pretends to shoot Sean, but Emily already knew of everything and cut the mics that the police planted. She takes out her own gun and shoots Sean in the shoulder for real while also confessing to the murders. Stephanie then reveals that she has a hidden camera on her blouse, and that her viewers have all seen Emily's confession. Emily attempts to escape as Stephanie goes after her. Emily draws her gun on Stephanie, but she gets slammed by a car driven by Darren. Moments later, the police arrive to arrest Emily.Six months later, Stephanie's vlog has hit one million viewers. She continues to provide recipes and home remedies, and is now investigating cold cases.Ending text states that Stephanie's vlog continues to bring in viewers, while she has also started a detective agency and has helped the police solve at least 30 cases.

The Predator,2018,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3829266/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"When a young boy accidentally triggers the universe's most lethal hunters' return to Earth, only a ragtag crew of ex-soldiers and a disgruntled scientist can prevent the end of the human race. From the outer reaches of space to the small-town streets of suburbia, the hunt comes home. Now, the universe's most lethal hunters are stronger, smarter and deadlier than ever before, having genetically upgraded themselves with DNA from other species. When a young boy accidentally triggers their return to Earth, only a ragtag crew of ex-soldiers and a disgruntled science teacher can prevent the end of the human race.—Twentieth Century Fox After a predator kills his entire platoon, a soldier sends evidence of the alien home, as proof of what really happened to his men. But after a genetically enhanced predator arrives on earth in search of what was stolen, the soldier teams up with a unit of ""looney"" soldiers and a geneticist, in a race to save his son that he unknowingly made into the predator's next target.—Eric S. Crane Scarred for life after a near-death experience and a close encounter with a mighty Predator, former U.S. Army Ranger sniper Quinn McKenna unwittingly makes his home a battlefield. As a result, his precocious son Rory has become a target. Now, relentless government agent Will Traeger and his heavily armed men will stop at nothing to retrieve rock-solid proof of the aliens' existence. Since the first encounter with the ultimate interstellar hunters inPredator (1987), the brutal space warriors have visited our world many times. However, this time, something entirely different--more powerful, more ferocious, and more evolved--is hunting us down one by one. Under those dire circumstances, can Quinn's crew of military misfits save the Earth?—Nick Riganas This latest of the long-running series 'Predator' films opens in outer space where a Predator/Hunter ship is being chased by another larger one. The first ship goes through a wormhole that leads it crashing toward planet Earth.Down in a forest in Mexico, sniper Quinn McKenna (Boyd Holbrook) is engaging in a hostage rescue against drug cartel members. Just as he gets eyes on his target, the smaller Predator ship makes its way down. Quinn manages to kill one gang member, but his attention is drawn toward the crash. He comes across some of the Predator's armor, including its cloaking device. Before Quinn finds the Predator, his teammate Dupree (Mike Dopud) finds Quinn. They then see their other teammate, Sapir (Niall Matter), fall from a tree, hanging upside down with a lot of his flesh missing. The Predator re-emerges and kills Dupree, but Quinn uses the Predator's gauntlet to shoot something that incapacitates the Predator and also slices off the top half of Sapir's body, and the falling blood makes the Predator visible in spite of its cloaking. Soon, a government team (Project Stargazer) led by Will Traeger (Sterling K. Brown) comes down to get their hands on the Predator.After the Predator is apprehended, Quinn takes his mask, gauntlet, and other gear to send back to his son and ex-wife's home. He swallows the cloaking device for good measure.In the next scene, we meet Quinn's son Rory (Jacob Tremblay), who has a mild type of autism. Some kids pull a fire alarm while he is in a room of kids playing chess, and the noises give him a sensory overload. The boys who pulled the alarm find Rory in his classroom huddled anxiously, but they leave before they can do anything more to mess with him. After the alarm is turned off, Rory rearranges the chess pieces on everyone's board in perfect order where they originated. When Rory gets home, he finds Quinn's package being delivered to him. His mother Emily (Yvonne Strahovski) comes home with two potential Halloween masks (a pirate and Frankenstein's monster), but Rory doesn't want to dress up because he knows the bullies will recognize and taunt him. Rory then opens the package to find the Predator's gear, and he becomes fascinated. As he turns the gear on, the larger Ultimate Predator that was chasing the Fugitive Predator gets a lock on the gear's location, and he sets off to Earth.Meanwhile, Quinn undergoes a psych evaluation following the disaster in Mexico, and he's then placed with other government prisoners - ex-Marine Gaylord ""Nebraska"" Williams (Trevante Rhodes), Tourette's-afflicted Baxley (Thomas Jane), joker Coyle (Keegan-Michael Key), religious Nettles (Augusto Aguilera), and Lynch (Alfie Allen), who is also a former Marine. The men trade jokes and insults as they meet Quinn.Biologist Casey Bracket (Olivia Munn) is contacted by Traeger's men and is escorted to a Project Stargazer lab to see the sedated Fugitive Predator. Casey meets Dr. Peter Keyes (Jake Busey) and then Traeger, who informs her of what they have studied from the Predator, specifically that he has traces of human DNA in him. She is heavily intrigued by the Predator and his history. Just then, the other scientists get word that the Ultimate Predator's ship is heading within close proximity of the lab. The Fugitive Predator wakes up, and as the other men try to hold him down, he starts to tear into them as he breaks out and proceeds to slaughter the men. After he takes his gear back, the Fugitive Predator spots Casey as she hides in the showers, but he doesn't harm her. A badly wounded Keyes tells Casey to not let him get away.As Fugitive Predator is breaking out, Quinn and the other men stage a diversion to get the soldiers off the bus so they can hijack it and head off to kill the alien. Casey also runs after it with a tranq gun. She hops on top of the bus and almost has a clear shot, but she misses and shoots herself in the foot. The bus's tire gets blown out, so the men are forced to escape on motorcycles, and Quinn takes Casey with him. Meanwhile, pilots are trying to shoot down Ultimate Predator's ship, but he puts up a force-field that prevents his ship from getting hit. The Fugitive Predator then hops in another bus, kills the men inside, and rides it into town. The Ultimate Predator descends and goes hunting with his two Predator Dogs.The guys hide out in a seedy motel room with Casey until she wakes up. She thinks they are there to harm her, so she grabs a nearby shotgun, only to discover it's unloaded. As she tries to leave, Quinn tells her that if she tries to go back to the lab, they will kill her because she was carrying a vial that was on the Fugitive Predator's person, leaving Casey with no choice but to stick with the guys. Quinn then figures that the Predator is heading to Emily's house to get the gear. They take the bus to her house, but she tells them that Rory is already out of the house with the mask, so they head out to find Rory.Rory goes out trick-or-treating with the Predator mask. The two bullies manage to spot and recognize him, and they start to taunt him. Rory goes to knock on a house, but he gets no answer. The man who lives there steps out from the balcony and also taunts Rory, then he throws something at the mask. It activates and triggers a blast that kills the man and blows up his house. This also causes the bullies to run off scared. The blast is spotted by Quinn and Casey, who drive back toward that direction.Rory walks onto a field where the Predator Dogs stalk him. Before they can attack, Quinn and the other guys drive in to fight them. Quinn manages to blow one up by shooting a grenade into its mouth, and the other one is shot to death. Fugitive Predator then shows up and grabs Nettles, ordering the gang to drop their weapons. They comply, but Quinn grabs his again and shoots at it, making him release Nettles. Everyone runs into Rory's middle school to evade the Predator. It corners and grabs Quinn, just as he tries to give back one of the Predator's weapons, but Ultimate Predator shows up and pulls Fugitive Predator through the window. The humans run away as the aliens battle each other, but Ultimate Predator smashes Fugitive Predator's face and tears his skull and spine out. He then heads off to find the humans. Afterwards, Traeger and his guys find Fugitive Predator's remains, and Traeger determines that Ultimate Predator was hunting him for something he took, and that he's also after Fugitive Predator's ship and whatever is inside. Traeger believes that if they find Rory, they will find the ship.The gang is found by Traeger, who wants to know where the gauntlet is. He interrogates Casey and tells her that the Ultimate Predator must be upgrading himself, which is why he's so much bigger than the Fugitive Predator. They came to Earth to use human DNA while they can since they know humans are endangered, and Fugitive Predator must have been carrying something that he didn't want Ultimate Predator to get his hands (or claws) on.Other government agents go to Emily's house to find the Predator gear, but Ultimate Predator shows up and very messily skewers all the men. He then comes across a map of where the other ship is located. Rory is also seen drawing this same map.Quinn breaks loose from the mercs who were assaulting him and he kills them. Another merc is about to execute Casey until a third, non-violent Predator Dog shows up and gives her a grenade that she stuff in the merc's backpack, causing him to blow up and letting her loose. Traeger and his goons take Rory with them to find the other ship, so Quinn and the gang follow.Everyone arrives at the site of the other ship. Traeger uses Rory to try and open the ship, and it works. They enter, and Quinn goes in with the cloaking device to kill one of Traeger's men for taking Rory. Outside, the rest of the gang starts to slay Traeger's goons right before Quinn holds Traeger outside at gunpoint, while his own men have him surrounded. Before anything else happens, Lynch gets his arm chopped off by Ultimate Predator. Before dying, he manages to signal the other guys. Ultimate Predator goes in, kills Traeger's men, and heads into the ship. He sends out a message that is translated to saying that he wants ""McKenna"" as his prize since he is the next step in the evolutionary chain. He then sets off a timer to destroy the ship.The team heads into the woods to fight Ultimate Predator. He tosses Baxley against a tree to impale him, and then he disembowels Coyle. The two men then mutually kill each other to put each other out of their misery. Traeger gets cocky and tries to kill Ultimate Predator with one of his own weapons, but it ends up blowing Traeger's own head off. Ultimate Predator then takes Rory, as he is technically the next step in the McKenna line. Quinn, Nebraska, and Nettles hop on Ultimate Predator's ship as it flies away, but he turns on the force-field, which slices off Nettles' legs and sends him falling off the ship to his death. Nebraska sacrifices himself by throwing his body into the ship's turbines to send it crashing down. Quinn gets in the ship and saves Rory before Ultimate Predator attacks. Casey uses the cloaking device to help Quinn fight the beast. Quinn uses the gauntlet to fire an explosive at the Ultimate Predator's leg, causing it to blow him up spectacularly. Quinn then finishes him with multiple shots to the head.In the aftermath, Quinn takes several keepsakes representing his fallen comrades, and he and Rory take a moment to memorialize the men.Sometime later, Quinn and Rory go to a lab where they meet Dr. Yamada (Peter Shinkoda), the new head of Project Stargazer. He brings Quinn to see the Predator's cargo that Fugitive Predator was smuggling. It opens up to reveal a powerful armor that Rory says is called the Predator Killer. The armor wraps itself around one scientist and looks like it might fire upon the others, but it turns off and goes back to normal. Quinn then declares that this is his new suit."

To fight the war, federal agent Matt Graver re-teams with the mercurial Alejandro. In this adventure/drama, CIA agent Matt Graver (Josh Brolin) enlists a mysterious operative to help investigate a Mexican drug cartel that has been smuggling terrorists into the U.S. Things escalate when the daughter of a top kingpin is abducted, forcing Graver and his partner to re-evaluate their mission.—ahmetkozan A suicide bombing in a Kansas City grocery store kills fifteen people. The United States government responds by authorizing CIA agent Matt Graver to apply extreme measures to combat Mexican drug cartels, who are suspected of smuggling the terrorists across the border. Graver and the Department of Defense decide the best option is to instigate a war between the major cartels, and Graver recruits black operative Alejandro Gillick for the mission. Gillick assassinates a high-profile lawyer of the Matamoros cartel in Mexico City while Graver and his team kidnap Isabel Reyes, the daughter of the kingpin of their rival, in a false flag operation. Graver, Gillick, and their team take Isabel to Texas and stage a ""rescue"" with the DEA and local police to make her think she was kidnapped by her father's enemies. Gillick bonds with Isabel and the team makes plans to transport her back to Mexico, intending to leave her in territory controlled by her father's rivals in order to further escalate the conflict. However, the Mexican police escort for their trip back across the border double-cross them and attack the American vehicles. Graver and his team kill dozens of Mexican policemen to escape the ambush. Set around three years after the events of the first 'Sicario' film, this sequel opens near the US-Mexico border in Texas. A team of operatives catch a man trying to get across the border. He is cornered by the other men until he pulls out a detonator and blows himself up.In Kansas City, Missouri, a group of terrorists perform suicide-bombings inside a department store, killing a number of civilians, including children. This raises the level of concern that terrorists are being smuggled into the United States from Mexico.CIA Agent Matt Graver (Josh Brolin) is brought in to meet with a suspected terrorist smuggler named Bashiir (Faysal Ahmed), whom Matt believes brought in the guys responsible for the store bombing. Matt demands Bashiir to give up the names of his employers, or an airstrike will take out his home with his family inside. Bashiir fails to give up any information, and Matt forces him to watch as the airstrike kills his brother.Somewhere in a Texas border town, we meet a young Mexican boy named Miguel Hernandez (Elijah Rodriguez), who skips school and joins his friend Hector (David Castaneda) as they hang out to smoke weed near the border. Hector's friends, who are in league with the cartel, are hanging out nearby. Hector offers Miguel employment with the cartel, promising a lot of money if he helps out. Miguel reluctantly agrees to join.In Washington DC, Matt is brought in to the Department of Homeland Security by a government official named Cynthia Foards (Catherine Keener) to meet with Secretary of Defense James Riley (Matthew Modine) to discuss a new mission. They want to start a war between Mexican cartels in order to put an end to the suspected terrorist smuggling. The plan is to go against the Matamoras Cartel, as well as their rival, led by kingpin Carlos Reyes. Matt is instructed to kidnap Reyes's youngest child. Matt agrees on the condition that he works dirty, which is exactly what Riley and his men want from him.Matt goes to find former 'sicario' Alejandro Gillick (Benicio Del Toro), who is now living in semi-retirement in Bogota, Columbia, telling him that they are turning him as loose as he can get with a new 'sicario' mission. With that, they travel to the USA and make their way across the border and find a group of men working for the Matamoras Cartel, including a top lawyer named Diaz.In Mexico City, Alejandro and his team of operatives shoot the other men as Alejandro goes after Diaz. He shoots him twice to bring him down, and he tosses Diaz a pair of glasses to look upon his killer. Alejandro removes his mask, bids Diaz farewell, and unloads his gun into him.At a private school, we meet Isabel (Isabela Moner), the young teenage daughter of Reyes. She is fighting another girl who scratches her face, prompting Isabel to deck her hard in the face. When they see the headmaster, Isabel says the other girl called her a ""narco whore"" and attacked her first. Isabel dares the headmaster to expel her, but he doesn't. As she is being escorted home by bodyguards, their van is ambushed by an explosion, followed by another car crashing into them. Alejandro, pretending to be a Matamoras member, kills the guards and kidnaps Isabel.Alejandro brings Isabel to a house in Texas where they stage a fake rescue to escort her back to Mexico. On their way back, Alejandro, Matt, Steve Forsing (Jeffrey Donovan), and Isabel's van are ambushed by Mexican Federal Police, who begin firing upon the Americans' convoy with bullets and RPG's. Isabel makes it out of the convoy and hides while the other men fire back. The remaining Mexican policemen appear to beg for mercy until one of them draws their weapons on the other agents, forcing them to return fire and kill them all. Matt and his team are forced to return back across the border while Alejandro volunteers to stay behind to find Isabel.Back in the States, Cynthia confronts Matt over their retaliation in the ambush because now the Mexican government has become aware of their operation. Additionally, the Kansas City bombing wasn't a result of the cartels, but from an unrelated group of terrorists. The situation has gotten so bad that the President of the USA has decided to shut their operation down over fears of being impeached, but Matt argues that they did what they had to do.Meanwhile, Isabel goes on the run and is caught by a lone agent. Before he can take her away, Alejandro blows his brains out. He personally escorts Isabel away, saying he will not hurt her. He reveals to her that he is one of her father's enemies. They find a deaf man named Angel (Bruno Bichir), and Alejandro is able to sign to him that he is not dangerous and that he only needs food and water for him and Isabel. Angel asks Alejandro how he knows how to sign, and he says he learned it from his deceased daughter. Later that night, Isabel realizes she knows about Alejandro being the lawyer whose family was murdered. He confirms that it was her father who ordered the hit that was carried out by Fausto Alarcon.Alejandro gets in touch with Matt, who orders Alejandro to kill Isabel since she was a witness to the ambush firefight. Alejandro refuses, officially going rogue. This leads Matt to order a team to go after him and Isabel.Meanwhile in Mexico, Miguel and his fellow gang members are initiating an operation in which they will start smuggling Mexicans over the border.Alejandro decides he must smuggle Isabel across the border so that the U.S. agents can't touch her. She cuts her hair and pretends her name is Carina. They board a bus with other Mexicans being smuggled, but the two of them are found by a gang leader who thinks he can sell Isabel back to her father for a large reward. The gang members pull the two out of the bus after binding and gagging them. The leader orders a young man named Jose (Tenzin Marco-Taylor) to execute Alejandro, but he can't bring himself to do so, and Jose is shot in the head. Miguel is then ordered to come up and do the task. He shoots Alejandro through the jaw, seemingly killing him. The gang members leave while Matt and Steve watch from the sky and see Alejandro's body. Steve says he is glad they did not have to do that themselves. Matt tells Steve it is time to clean the place up.The gang drives away, congratulating Miguel for his work. However, he decides he wants no part in their world, and he hops out of the van. Matt and his team then come across the gang and shoot them all dead. Matt recovers Isabel and decides to bring her back to the States so she can be put in witness protection.Alejandro turns out to have survived his gunshot, despite losing a lot of blood. He frees himself by cutting the tape off using Jose's belt before heading off and finding the gang's van and their stash of weapons. As he drives away, he is spotted by two other gang members that try to shoot him, but he tosses a grenade in their car to blow them up. Alejandro then drives slowly off-road and crashes into a post from blood loss.One year later in Texas, we see Miguel (now sporting a number of tattoos on his body) as he walks into a shopping mall to his job in the food court. He finds Alejandro in the backroom, with his face wounds now having healed. Alejandro decides to teach Miguel the ways of the sicario (hitman)."

But, is that even possible? With his fellow white Jewish partner, Flip Zimmerman, doing the undercover work, Ron will go to great lengths to expose the nefarious organization's plans, setting in motion a boldly methodical and outrageous scheme right in the heart of the KKK. For how long will Ron and Flip be able to keep going their increasingly dangerous charade?—Nick Riganas The film starts with a small video of a battlefield with the bodies of Confederate soldiers lying everywhere as some try to help those wounded while others mourn over the dead. It then cuts to another video from Dr. Kennebrew Beauregard (Alec Baldwin), who launches into a racist tirade of how African Americans are taking over the country and causing trouble for white Protestant Americans.Colorado Springs, CO. 1979Ron Stallworth (John David Washington) arrives at the local police station. He is interviewed by Chief Bridges (Robert John Burke) and Mr. Turrerntine (Isiah Whitlock, Jr.) over whether or not he would be qualified on the force. Given the current social and political climate regarding African Americans, they want to know how Ron would react if a white officer were to harass him, and Ron says he would turn the other cheek if he needs to. Ron is then made the first black officer on the force.Ron's first job is to work in the filing department. He is antagonized by a Patrolman named Andy Landers (Frederick Weller). Ron then goes to Bridges and requests that he be put on an assignment to get out in the field, but Bridges declines his request. However, Bridges later changes his mind and decides to send Ron to a Black Panther meeting to see if they are planning to radicalize themselves. A known activist, Stokely Carmichael (Corey Hawkins), is said to be speaking there. Bridges has Detectives Flip Zimmerman (Adam Driver) and Jimmy Creek (Michael Buscemi) sit in as Ron goes in with a wire.Ron attends the meeting and meets Patrice Dumas (Laura Harrier), head of the Black Student Union. He tries to convince her that he is down with their cause. They enter for the meeting, where Carmichael, now going as Kwame Ture, starts to speak. He gives an impassioned speech of how everyone there must learn to love their black culture and to not be ashamed or try to conform for white folks. Kwame then starts to speak about an impending race war between black people and white officers who are constantly killing them in the streets, and that the black community must arm themselves in the face of a threat. Ron becomes invested in Kwame's words, but also weary about his beliefs in a race war.Later, Ron meets Patrice at a club. She tells him that they were pulled over by racist white police officers while taking Kwame back to the airport. We see the incident, and Landers was the one who pulled them over and started harassing Patrice while two other officers were holding them at gunpoint. They discuss their feelings on the matter, and how the relationship between black folks and the police are, before they head out on the dance floor.After bringing his information back to Bridges, Ron feels that they need not look further into the Black Panthers despite Bridges hearing about Kwame talking about the race war. Ron goes to the intelligence office to answer phones and sits to read a paper. He finds an ad for the Ku Klux Klan, and he becomes compelled to call. Ron poses as a white man as he speaks to a Klan chapter president named Walter Breachway (Ryan Eggold) over the phone, and Ron manages to convince Walter that is is, in fact, a racist white Aryan man. They arrange for a meeting to be set up, although Ron realizes he screwed up by using his real name. Ron brings this to Bridges and requests to use one of the white officers to play the Ron Stallworth that Walter thinks he spoke to. They decide to use Flip, and they use a script to differentiate between speaking ""white English"" and ""jive"". Flip is also given a wire to use for his face-to-face meetings with the Klan.Flip meets another Klan member named Felix Kendrickson (Jasper Paakonen) while Ron and Jimmy are attempting to keep a close watch on them. Felix drives Flip to one of the Klan's meeting spots, but he reminds Flip to refer to them as ""The Organization"". Felix spots Ron driving close behind him, and he has Flip load a gun just in case. They drive off and Ron gets off his tail when he realizes he was noticed. Felix then brings Flip to a pool hall where he meets Walter and a constantly drunk Klansman named Ivanhoe (Paul Walter Hauser). Felix keeps suspecting that Flip might be Jewish (he is), but Flips convinces Walter that he is just as racist as the rest of them.In between the investigation, Ron continues to see Patrice, having to hide the fact that he is a cop since she hates them and always refers to them as ""pigs"". She and her fellow BSU members are also disturbed by the appearance of Klan fliers all around the neighborhood. Ron has the police intervene on Klan activity, like cross-burnings.Ron speaks to Sergeant Trapp (Ken Garito), as they are trying to gather information on the Grand Wizard of the Klan, David Duke (Topher Grace), who is running for office, and they want to prevent him from going any higher since they don't want someone like Duke in office. Ron believes that people would never vote for someone like him, but Trapp tells him to wake up.Ron listens in on another meeting as Flip goes to Felix's house to meet other Klansmen and Felix's wife Connie (Ashlie Atkinson). They are planning something against Patrice and her group, since they know she has been so vocal about her stance on racism and police brutality. Felix, still not trusting Flip, brings him into his basement for a ""Jew lie detector test"". Sensing trouble, Ron runs up to the house and throws a rock through a window to scare Connie, and then run like hell before the men run out with guns. Flip shoots at the car but intentionally misses to prove to the others he's on their side.Felix looks up Ron Stallworth in the phone book and goes to Ron's apartment to find him there with Patrice. Felix later asks Flip about this during another meeting, but Flip says his number is unlisted and that he lives on a different street.Ron then manages to get in touch with Duke himself. Like the others that spoke to Ron on the phone, he is also convinced that Ron is a ""true white American"". Ron, however, has to hide his disgust with Duke's rhetoric and racist talk against black folks. At the same time, Flip is made the head of the Klan's chapter since he's gained trust among the others, but he tries to tell them that he can't perform his duties with them consistently because of his ill father. He slips up when mentioning this because Ron had said his sick dad was in El Paso, and Flip said Dallas, which the others catch onto until Flip corrects himself.Felix, Connie, and Ivanhoe meet with another Klansman named Walker (Nicholas Turturro) who brings them C4 that they plan to use against the BSU, although Patrice is their main target.Bridges assigns Ron to protect Duke as he is arriving in town. Landers makes more snide remarks toward Ron, leading him to snap and almost attack him. Bridges tells him that if he let Landers get to him so easily, he won't stand a chance with Duke.Ron goes to find Patrice to warn her not to go to a planned march with the BSU, because that's where the Klan is planning to attack them. He has to reveal to Patrice that he is a cop, and she becomes so upset that she refuses to see him, even as he tries to tell her that while he is down for the liberation of their people, he is loyal to his duties as an officer.Ron then goes to meet Duke, having to hide his phone voice. Duke shows clear disdain for who his bodyguard is, but retains his professional demeanor. The other Klansmen, however, are less subtle, as Felix and Ivanhoe surround Ron in an attempt to intimidate him. Ron approaches Duke to ask for a Polaroid together with him and another Klansman. He asks Flip to take the picture, and just as the camera flashes, Ron puts his arms around both Duke and the other man to anger them. Although Duke tries to come off as threatening, Ron reminds him he is a police officer and can arrest him for laying a finger on him.Duke then rounds up the Klansmen for a meeting to have Flip have his official initiation. Meanwhile, the BSU is listening to a man named Jerome Turner (Harry Belafonte) as he recalls a mentally handicapped friend from his youth named Jesse, who was found guilty by an all white jury for the alleged rape and murder of a white woman, and they only deliberated for four minutes. Jesse was chained and paraded through the streets where he was stabbed and attacked, and later castrated. This cuts between Duke spreading his message of hate and white power, while the BSU goes for justice and black power.After Flip's initiation, the Klan gathers for lunch. Walker tells Felix that he recognizes Flip as the cop who busted him years ago, and he knows that Flip is Jewish. Furthermore, Walker points out to Felix that it's Ron who's been speaking to them on the phone. The two of them then try to get Flip to reveal himself, but he doesn't budge. Ron then follows Connie, as he knows she is up to something suspicious. Felix leaves moments later with Walker and Ivanhoe, and Flip follows them.Connie arrives at Patrice's home to place the C4 in her mailbox, but it won't fit. She has to run when Patrice and her friend arrive. After they go into their house, Connie sticks the bomb under Patrice's car, and Ron spots her. He chases her after saying he's a cop, and he tackles her to the ground. Two other officers show up and naturally get the wrong idea, made worse by Connie shouting that Ron was trying to rape her. The officers start to assault Ron right before Flip pulls up and tells the officers to back off after proving Ron is an undercover cop. Felix then drives up right next to Patrice's car, thinking the bomb is in the mailbox. Patrice and her friend step outside after seeing Ron on the ground, just as he tries to warn them as Felix takes out the detonator. The C4 goes off, killing Felix, Ivanhoe, and Walker. Connie wails as she sees this, and she is arrested.Ron later has dinner with Patrice in a place where Landers comes in to mess with them. She brings up the harassment incident, which Landers proudly admits to, as well as spewing threats against them. Turns out Ron was wearing a wire for Flip, Jimmy, and Bridges to hear, and Landers is quickly arrested.Not long after, Ron has one last phone call with Duke, where he reveals himself as the black man that he met, and he proceeds to tell Duke off for being a racist jackass, leaving him completely bewildered.The department thinks of Ron as a hero for his success in the operation. Bridges then brings Ron, Flip, Jimmy, and Trapp into his office. He orders Ron to destroy evidence of the investigation since he doesn't want the public to know about the whole thing. The guys are outraged, but Ron proceed to tear up the file. The phone then starts ringing, and, thinking it might be the Klan, Ron doesn't answer. He starts to leave the building, but then he goes back inside to answer.Ron is in his apartment with Patrice. She breaks it off with him because she doesn't want to be with a cop. Moments later, they hear a pounding outside. They get their guns and walk out. They see out the window, not far from them, the Klan is burning a cross.We then cut to actual footage of the 2017 Charlotesville riots with neo-Nazis and white supremacists marching in the streets, as well as clips of Black Lives Matter activists chanting against them. There is footage of the Nazis clashing with the police, as well as videos of President Donald Trump's reaction to the incident, referring to the Nazis as ""very fine people"". Another clip shows the real David Duke with other white nationalists who feel empowered by Trump's words during the election. Additionally, there is horrifying footage of a Nazi running his car through a crowd of people, with the surviving victims expressing their horror at the situation. Finally, there is a dedication the Heather Heyer, the woman killed when the car struck her.The last shot is a silent image of an upside down American flag shown in black and white."
I Feel Pretty,2018,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6791096/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A woman struggling with insecurity wakes from a fall believing she is the most beautiful and capable woman on the planet. Her new confidence empowers her to live fearlessly, but what happens when she realizes her appearance never changed? In I FEEL PRETTY a woman who struggles with feelings of deep insecurity and low self-esteem, that hold her back everyday, wakes from a brutal fall in an exercise class believing she is suddenly a supermodel. With this newfound confidence she is empowered to live her life fearlessly and flawlessly, but what will happen when she realizes her appearance never changed?—STXfilms Renee Bennett is a young woman who struggles with low self-esteem and insecurities over her appearance. Out of a Chinatown basement office, she manages the website for cosmetics firm Lily LeClaire with co-worker Mason, while aspiring to work in their Fifth Avenue headquarters. When a vacancy for a receptionist comes up at HQ, she decides not to apply after reading the job description's emphasis on being the beautiful ""face"" of LeClaire. One night, inspired by the movie Big, Renee wishes at a fountain to be beautiful, but nothing happens. The next day, Renee falls off her SoulCycle bike during an exercise class, hitting her head and losing consciousness. When she wakes, she has not changed physically, but she believes herself to be astonishingly beautiful.. Renee Bennett (Amy Schumer) is a normal, overweight but healthy 30-something woman with major self-esteem issues. The film starts off by immediately establishing this in a series of short moments of her day to day life. She visits a clothing store where she is told by a clerk that her plus size may be better found on their online store. She visits a Soul Cycle class. In the locker room, she encounters a woman who far more matches Western beauty standards: thin, young, classic features. This woman is surprisingly friendly to Renee, asking if she too is there for the first time. This takes Renee aback as she is not used to beautiful women being kind to her. Renee then tries to participate in the class, but her bicycle seat collapses underneath her and slams into her groin, injuring her. (This is not because of her body weight but because the seat was not properly screwed in, but she takes it personally.)That night Renee gets together with her two best friends, Vivian (Aidy Bryant) and Jane (Busy Philipps.) In getting ready to meet them, Renee tries to follow along with styling instructional videos on YouTube but fails. She also reads gossip about the LeClaire family.After meeting up, the three sign up for a dating service where groups of three friends go out on triple-dates, and they discuss how no one on dating apps ever looks past the picture. They pose for group photos and decide on one to upload to the site. Then they go out for drinks and dancing. Renee's lack of self-confidence makes it difficult for her to get drinks at the bar. When Renee gets home that night, she undresses in front of the mirror and feels badly over her plump body and appearance.The next day we discover Renee works for LeClaire Cosmetics. However, she works in a dingy basement office in Chinatown and dreams of working at the main office downtown. Her schlubby co-worker Mason (Adrian Martinez) tries to make conversation with her but it's awkward, and ultimately he tells her that he masturbated the night before. Renee's job is to photograph cosmetics for display on the company website. Someone has complained that something she photographed is more orange in real life than in the photos, and she is frustrated with her job.We cut to the downtown offices where Avery LeClaire (Michelle Williams), a beautiful and thin woman with a baby voice, is in a meeting with her staff. She is overseen by her mother Lily (Lauren Hutton) who has founded their company. They have launched a line of less expensive and more accessible cosmetics for sale at retails stores like Target, but they are not selling well, and the advertising campaign is tanking. Lily realizes that because of her wealth and beauty Avery has a disconnect with the product line and doesn't understand how to properly market it.The day after that, Renee runs into the woman from Soul Cycle at a Target store. She starts asking her about what it's like to be so beautiful, and while conversing, a man comes over. He interrupts them to flirt with the other woman, referred to Renee as a Target employee and calling her a man. He's extremely rude, and the other woman tells him she isn't going to give him her number. He leaves, and Renee marvels at what it must be like to have that happen all of the time.Later at work, there is a server issue, so Renee must print out a bunch of informational reports and hand deliver them to the downtown office. She arrives, and interacts with the beautiful but rude receptionist, who is just an intern. She sees Lily walk through the office and is in awe. She finds out that the company is looking for a permanent receptionist, and despite the fact that it would technically be a step down in both title and pay, she longs to have the job just to be around the beautiful and wealthy people.At home that night she is watching the Tom Hanks movie ""Big."" It is the scene where he wishes to be bigger. In a moment of fancy, she runs outside into the rain and throws a coin into a fountain. She wishes to be beautiful. After making the wish, she looks into her mirror compact and is sad to see it did not come true.The next day Renee goes to Soul Cycle class. She makes sure to screw down her seat properly this time. The class instructor shouts out motivational phrases about destiny and miracles happening, and it seems as if she is being spoken to specifically. Shortly after starting the class, her shoe detaches from the cycle, and she falls and hits her head, ripping a clump of hair out in the wheel of another bike. She goes unconscious.When she wakes up, she is in a locker room. An employee (Sasheer Zamata) is looking over her. She offers an ice pack and a free bandanna. As Renee comes to, she starts to notice her limbs, starting with her legs and then arms. She seems to be reacting to them as if there's something wrong, and the employee is concerned. Renee then looks in the mirror and is stunned to see that she has transformed into an incredibly beautiful, physically fit version of herself. (Except she hasn't. She is hallucinating/imagining it. Everyone else still sees her as being overweight.)Now believing that the world sees her this way, she begins to behave with the confidence of a woman who has these features. She goes to pick up her dry cleaning, and behind her in line is Ethan (Rory Scovel.) They strike up a conversation, and Renee jokes that the dry cleaner calls out people's numbers at random. Ethan asks what her number is, and she believes he is hitting on her. She forces him to exchange phones so they can enter one anothers' number in each others' phone. Rory is bewildered by her confident, outgoing personality, even as she is handed her vomit-covered clothing (the dry cleaner couldn't get it out.)With her newfound confidence, Renee submits her resume for the receptionist position and is called in to interview. She goes into the office where everyone reacts to her as if they are surprised she is there. She takes this in the wrong way, assuming that she seems out of place because she is SO beautiful that she would never bother for such a position. She interviews with Avery and Helen (Naomi Campbell). They keep giving indicators that they don't think she's the right fit, but again she takes this to mean that they don't understand why she wouldn't pursue modeling, or confusion as to why she would take a step-down in pay. Because of her overwhelming confidence, she gets the job, but also Avery sees potential to have an ""every woman"" nearby from whom she can get advice on how to market their new budget cosmetics line.Renee meets up with her friends and tries to ease them into believing that it's her, believing they see the ""new"" version of herself. She tries to offer up facts only she would know, including that they all planned on getting 90210 themed tattoos (which Vivian did before the other two bailed.) Because she doesn't look any different, the two go along with the situation. The trio checks their dating app profile, but it has not even been viewed. Renee suggests they take a new photo with her new beautiful body as it will get more attention.Renee goes back to her old office and bids goodbye to Mason, who is attempting to take a dump while she speaks to him. She says he should have hit on her when he had the chance, and he begs her to leave him alone so he can finish. She leaves, and starts her new receptionist job. Renee goes into the job with confidence and a great attitude. She stocks fresh cold water in a mini fridge under her desk and provides visitors with a straw. A woman arrives for a meeting and based on how Renee looks, assumes she is in the wrong place, but Renee wins her over with a great attitude and friendliness.It turns out Grant LeClaire is observing Renee, and he approaches her to say hello. Renee is slightly overwhelmed and confesses that she knows about him and has followed him in the media. She even stocked a green health beverage in her mini fridge in case he came by, because she saw him drinking it in a tabloid. She jokes about the many women with whom he is linked, and fears he is offended, but he is clearly refreshed by Renee's great attitude. He even mentions how impressed he is that Avery hired her.Later Renee is bringing water on a tray to a staff meeting about the new budget makeup line and accidentally knocks a blush compact out of an employee's hand. She kneels down to pick it up and notices there is no applicator in the packaging. Avery gently scolds Renee, pointing out that if she were more familiar with the brand, she would know none of their blushers include applicators. Renee says that although she did know this, she just assumed a budget version would include one. She points out that the everyday woman buys these products and puts them on on-the-go, in many situations, and doesn't bring along brushes of her own. She may be doing so in the car, for instance, and is forced to apply with only he finger. Avery graciously thanks Renee for this valuable input. (Renee is never condescending or unkind to Renee, and her interest in what she has to say seems genuine and never an attempt to take advantage.)That evening Renee calls up Ethan and under the guise of making it easier for him to ask her out because of her beauty, she asks him out instead. He has no recollection of who she is. The two have a day out walking around together, and they end up at a beach bar that is having a bikini contest. Renee desperately wants them to go inside, so they do. Ethan says if she's into watching it, so is he, until she reveals she wants to enter and win the $500 prize. Ethan is concerned for her, and though he doesn't say it out loud, he is obviously worried she will be mocked or insulted. All the other contestants are very young and thin.Renee gets up on stage and wins the audience over with her rowdy, bawdy personality, doing a sexy dance on stage and even pouring water over her breasts. The crowd reacts positively, but she does not win the contest. Ethan admits that he is incredibly impressed by her confidence, and Renee says she doesn't care if she won the contest because she knows she's beautiful and she had fun. The two go back to Renee's place, and Renee quickly undresses and then shows off her body to Ethan as a ""preview,"" to which he jokes she might not understand what a ""preview"" is. They head to bed, and Ethan leaves his shirt on and turns out the light. Renee turns it back on, and as they start to kiss, Ethan turns it off again. She turns it back on and asks if he doesn't want to see her. He says he very much wants to see her, but thought perhaps she wouldn't want to see him. She makes it clear that she does, and they make love. While doing so, Renee mounts him, and sees her reflection in the mirror over the bed and is very turned on by it. So is Ethan. After making love, they cuddle, and he again marvels at her confidence.An undetermined amount of time passes (probably around a month.)The next day at work, Avery rushes to Renee and begs for help. She confesses that she simply doesn't know how to market their new budget makeup line, and pleads with Renee to help spearhead the campaign and take on more responsibility. She also laments that no one takes her seriously (despite her advanced degree) because of her beauty and her baby voice, which she has tried to shed but cannot. Renee agrees to do so, and Avery asks her to come to a fancy dinner with the company bigwigs to discuss the situation. Renee says yes, and Avery says she should bring along a date (going through a comedic list of potential date genders in the process.) Renee says she does have someone to bring.Sometime later Renee and Ethan attend dinner at an upscale restaurant. All three members of the LeClaire family are there. Renee easily impresses Lily with her candor about the budget cosmetics line and insists that Renee come along to the major pitch meeting they are having with Target's people in Boston. It becomes clear that Grant is enamored with Renee.After dinner, Renee meets up with her friends and takes them to a Chinese restaurant where coworkers from LeClaire said a hidden speakeasy was located in the back. No one in the restaurant will tell them how to get to it, so the three sit down to dinner. Renee is somewhat rude to her friends, asking why they didn't dress up as she asked, and they brush it off. Suddenly a stream of models come in, and Renee rushes over to them to say hi. She comes back to her friends and reveals that only she herself would be allowed to go back, but she would only go if they're okay with it. They reluctantly say yes, and Renee disappears, leaving them alone.The next night Renee meets up with her friends again. The dating app has scored them a trio of men, and even though Renee now has Ethan, she agrees to play along. However, she is extremely rude and unkind to her friends, interrupting them when they try to connect with the men in conversation and essentially painting them as unattractive, boring people with ""potential"". The men are clearly put off by Renee, and her friends pull her aside and ask her why she's behaving this way. Renee really thinks she's being a great wing man and doesn't understand why they're upset, so she leaves.A few days later Renee boards a private jet to fly out to the Boston meeting. Avery is on the plane, and Renee attempts to go over her presentation, but Avery has taken sleeping pills. Renee moves back to sit with Grant, whose interest in her becomes even more obvious. Later, at the hotel, Grant knocks on Renee's door. He comes in and asks to order room service, claiming that Avery blocked his ability to charge to his own room which is next door. He is attempting to seduce Renee, eventually luring her into the bedroom where he tries to kiss her. Before he can do so, Renee gets a photo text from Ethan, and she snaps out of it. She shoves Grant out of the bedroom and runs into the bathroom claiming to have diarrhea. She turns on the glass shower and goes inside, but she runs into the glass and is knocked unconscious.When Renee awakens, she has a nasty bleeding wound on her forehead. She gets out of the shower and realizes she has missed her meeting with Avery to go over the presentation. She runs down to the hotel lobby, and she encounters Mason who has been brought along on the trip to handle A/V tech. He recognizes her, and she is horrified because based on her ""new self,"" he should not. She looks in the mirror and discovers that she sees her old self again. Devastated that she has reverted to her ""ugly"" form, and knowing Avery and others will not recognize her, she gives her presentation to Mason and tells him to deliver it to Avery to do herself. Renee flees back home.At home, she gets a video call from Ethan, who is excited to see her again, but she hides off camera so he can't see her. She says she can't meet him because she injured her back on the plane, and he offers to come over to take care of her. She says he can't because her place is being fumigated for ants, and he says, in that case, he should come get her and take her elsewhere. She realizes her lies aren't adding up and agrees to a date on Saturday. She then proceeds to get extremely drunk in her grief over her ""lost"" beauty. She visits Vivian's house, and discovers Vivian and Jane are on a date with their two guys from the app. Vivian says Renee was cruel to them and doesn't want to see her, so Renee leaves in rejection.The next day Renee goes back to Soul Cycle and attempts to recreate her accident to be ""beautiful"" again, but it doesn't work. She encounters the beautiful woman from before who is now crying in the locker room. The woman says she has been broken up with and Renee is incredulous that beautiful people get broken up with at all. Renee calls the woman stupid (in a colloquial fashion,) and the woman is upset because she has been burdened with people assuming she is stupid her whole life. Renee apologizes, and the two make amends.The next morning Renee wakes up to numerous missed calls from Avery. In a voicemail, Avery says that she delivered the presentation in Boston but it didn't go well and she wishes Renee would come back and help her. That night Renee goes to the restaurant where she is supposed to meet Ethan. She assumes he will not recognize her, still believing that he fell in love with her ""beautiful"" version. She goes inside to a seat about 50 feet from him and texts, saying she is stuck at work and understands if he wants to bail. Ethan thinks she is playing some kind of sexy game, so he goes and sits next to her, pretending not to know her (while she thinks he, in fact, DOESN'T know her.) He says he is waiting for his girlfriend, but maybe he could buy her a drink while they wait.Renee has an emotional reaction to him identifying her as ""girlfriend,"" and asks him about his ""girlfriend"" (herself.) He says she is the smartest, most creative, most beautiful woman in the world. This breaks Renee's heart because again, she thinks she is talking about the way she BELIEVES he previously saw her. She flees the bar, and then calls him and breaks up with him, leaving him extremely confused.Renee decides to try and help Avery while simultaneously making amends with her friends. She calls her friends and begs them to attend the big launch party for the new cosmetics line. She then arranges with Mason to take control of the A/V, and when Avery comes out and struggles with her presentation, Mason cuts the sound and lights, and Avery leaves the stage. Renee then appears behind a transparent scrim, and attempts to jump through it three times (each time splatting against it instead.) Vivian and Jane arrive just in time to see this.Renee comes out on stage and puts up a photo of herself at the receptionist desk at LeClaire. She says that this is how everyone knows her, as a perfect beauty, but would they be surprised to see her looking like ""this"", and then put up another photo next to it of her working in the basement of the Chinatown office. But when Renee turns around and sees the photos, she sees that she looks the same. Suddenly she realizes that the magic spell never actually happened, and all along all of these people saw her the way she always was and not as some perfect beauty. She realizes that she accomplished everything simply being herself.Renee then gives an uplifting speech about how every woman deserves to feel beautiful. She talks about how young girls have perfect confidence that over time gets chipped away by the world, and that LeClaire aims to help women get back to that natural state of total self-esteem. She projects photos of numerous types of women of every size, color, and age, including Jane and Vivian. The presentation goes over splendidly. When she goes off stage, she apologizes to Avery. Avery says the presentation was weird but went over perfectly. She also points out the company has excellent mental health benefits, indicating Renee's job is still there for her if she wants it.Renee, now realizing Ethan fell in love with her just as she always was, rushes to his home. She buzzes his video intercom and begins explaining to him that she broke with him for her own reasons and not because of him. She also picks her nose, not realizing she is on video. He rushes out to her, and picks her nose for her, getting what she couldn't reach. They laugh and makeup, and embrace.The last shot is of Renee, at the Soul Cycle class. She is now exercising because she wants to improve herself, not out of any fantasy goal or wish for a miracle. The camera zooms in on her determined, smiling face as she rigorously rides, and fades to black."
Vice,2018,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6266538/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The story ofDick Cheney, an unassuming bureaucratic Washington insider, who quietly wielded immense power as Vice President toGeorge W. Bush, reshaping the country and the globe in ways that are still felt today. GovernorGeorge W. Bushof Texas, picksDick Cheney, the CEO of Halliburton Company, to be his Republican running mate in the 2000 presidential election. No stranger to politics, Cheney's impressive resume includes stints as White House Chief of Staff, House Minority Whip, and Defense Secretary. When Bush wins by a narrow margin, Cheney begins to use his newfound power to help reshape the country and the world.—Jwelch5742 From being a Yale University dropout doing odd jobs in early-1960s Wyoming,Dick Cheneydecides to take back control of his life, after his sweetheart and future wifeLynne Cheney's urgent ultimatum. As an intern duringRichard Nixon's administration, Cheney grabs the opportunity to join the staff of his mentor,Donald Rumsfeld, who takes him under his wing, paving the way to rise through the ranks of the White House. After losing his job duringJimmy Carter's presidency, Cheney reluctantly acceptsGeorge W. Bush's proposal to be his running mate--a decision that would grant him the power to pull the strings of foreign policy, especially after the fateful and devastating 9/11 terrorist attacks.—Nick Riganas The political life ofDick Cheney, culminating with his Vice-Presidency in theGeorge W. Bushadministration from 2000 to 2008, is presented, that political life largely supported by his equally ambitious wife,Lynne Cheney. Their political ambitions were generally hindered by his less than charismatic demeanor which most politicians require to succeed. Those politics drifted into the right side of the spectrum rather than moving to the right by a deliberately ideological choice. But being elected the sole House Representative from their home state of Wyoming under the Republican banner led to ultimate thoughts of the top job in the White House. A number of factors kiboshed those thoughts, including how to protect his daughterMary Cheney, who had just come out as lesbian, from public scrutiny while reconciling his support for her against the strong social conservative base of the Republican Party. The Cheneys' political fortunes changed when Dick, in the private sector as CEO of Halliburton, was asked by relatively-inexperienced George W. Bush to be his running mate. In this process, Dick began a manipulation of the system to his benefit where in his position of eventual VP he was able to be a more powerful politician working quietly and clandestinely behind the scenes than if he was actual president in the constant spotlight.—Huggo Vice is narrated by Kurt (Jesse Plemons), a fictitious veteran of the Afghanistan and Iraq Wars. The film opens with Dick Cheney (Christian Bale) and other White House officials and staff responding to the September 11 attacks. The film then flashes back to Wyoming in 1963, where Cheney finds work as a lineman but struggles with alcoholism that led him to drop out of Yale (His girlfriend Lynne got him that scholarship at Yale). After Cheney is stopped by a traffic cop for driving while intoxicated, his wife Lynne Cheney (Amy Adams) convinces her husband to clean up his life (Lynne is smart and educated, but needs Dick in 1960's as back then women cant get successful without a man's help).The film flashes forward to 1969 when Cheney finds work as a White House intern during the Nixon Administration. Working under Nixon's economic advisor Donald Rumsfeld (Steve Carell), Cheney becomes a savvy political operative as he juggles commitments to Lynne and his two daughters Liz (Lily Rabe) and Mary Cheney (Alison Pill). Cheney overhears Henry Kissinger (Kirk Bovill) discussing the secret bombing of Cambodia with President Richard Nixon, revealing the true power of the executive branch to Cheney. Rumsfeld's abrasive attitude leads to him (Nixon sends Rumsfeld to Brussels as Permanent Ambassador to NATO) and Cheney being distanced from Nixon, which works in both men's favor; after Nixon's resignation, Cheney rises to the position of White House Chief of Staff for President Gerald Ford while Rumsfeld becomes Secretary of Defense.After Ford is voted out of office, Cheney runs to be representative for Wyoming. After giving an awkward and non charismatic campaign speech, Cheney suffers his first heart attack. While he recovers, Lynne campaigns on her husband's behalf, helping him to win a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives. During the Reagan Administration, Cheney supports a raft of conservative, pro-business policies favoring the fossil fuel industries. Cheney next serves as Secretary of Defense under President George H. W. Bush during the Gulf War. Outside of politics, Cheney and Lynne come to terms with their younger daughter Mary coming out as gay. Though Cheney develops ambitions to run for president, he decides to retire from public life to spare Mary from media scrutiny.During the presidency of Bill Clinton, Cheney becomes the CEO of Halliburton while his wife Lynne raises golden retrievers and writes books. A false epilogue claims that Cheney lived the rest of his life healthy and happy in the private sector and the credits roll, only for the film to continue.Cheney is invited to become running mate to George W. Bush (Sam Rockwell) during the 2000 United States presidential election. Recognizing that the younger Bush is more interested in pleasing his father than attaining power for himself, Cheney agrees on the condition that Bush delegates ""mundane"" executive responsibilities like energy and foreign policy to him. As Vice President, Cheney works with Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld, legal counsel David Addington (Don McManus), and Chief of Staff Scooter Libby (Justin Kirk) to exercise control of key foreign policy and defense decisions throughout Washington.As VP, Cheney still manages to have regular meetings with energy CEOs' with plans to acquire Iraqi oilfields should they become available.The film returns to the aftermath of the September 11 attacks, as Cheney and Rumsfeld maneuver to initiate and then preside over the US invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq, resulting in the killing of civilians and the torture of prisoners. As the War on Terror mounts, Cheney continues to struggle with persistent heart attacks. The film also covers various events from his vice presidency, including his endorsement of the Unitary executive theory, the Plame affair, the accidental shooting of Harry Whittington, and tensions between the Cheney sisters over same-sex marriage. Cheney's actions are shown to lead to thousands of deaths and the rise of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, resulting in him receiving record-low approval ratings by the end of the Bush administration.While narrating Cheney's tearful deathbed goodbye to his family after another hospitalization, Kurt is killed in a motor accident while jogging. In March 2012, his healthy heart is transplanted into Cheney. A few months later, Cheney permits Liz to take a public stand against same-sex marriage as she runs for a Senate seat in Wyoming. She later wins election to her father's former Congressional position, leading to the fragmenting of the Cheney family. At the end of the film, an irate Cheney breaks the fourth wall and delivers a monologue to the audience, stating that he has no regrets about anything he has done in his career. A mid-credits scene depicts a focus group descending into chaos when a right-winger slams the film itself as biased and wrestles with a liberal panelist, while two younger panelists discuss the next Fast and Furious movie."

The boys pick up a bunch of random junk until Sonny finds a stuffed cat and pries it off the fireplace, which opens a secret compartment containing a chest. Inside is a locked book.

The True Story of the Army's Special Forces ""Green Berets"", who within weeks responded to the 9-11 attack. Green Berets, with the help of the 160th SOAR(A), took over the country and allowed other Special Forces and the rest of the conventional military to begin the more publicly visible war.—Oso Mitch Nelson, a US Army Captain with Green Berets Operational Detachment Alpha (ODA) 595, is moving into a new home with his wife and daughter on September 11, 2001, after receiving an assignment to staff duty under LTC Bowers. As news of the devastating terrorist attacks that day break, Nelson volunteers to lead 595 into Afghanistan. Bowers initially refuses, but veteran soldier CW5 Hal Spencer, previously scheduled to retire, persuades Bowers to give Nelson command of 595 again, as well as volunteering himself for the deployment. After leaving their families, 595 travels to Uzbekistan on October 7, 2001. After being briefed and evaluated by COL Mulholland, Commander of 5th Special Forces Group, Nelson and 595 are picked to fight alongside Northern Alliance leader Abdul Rashid Dostum.. After the tragic events of 9/11, the US determines that the Taliban in Afghanistan is the source of many of the attacks on US citizens and assets. Their first step in confronting the Taliban is to send in Special Forces teams to link up with the Northern Alliance, the enemies of the Taliban, help them in their fight against Taliban, including through coordinating air support, and reduce the Taliban's territory. The first team ""in country"" is Operational Detachment Alpha 595, lead by Captain Mitch Nelson. The 12 of them face overwhelming odds. This is their story.—grantss Mitch Nelson, a U.S. Army captain with Green Berets Operational Detachment Alpha (ODA) 595, is moving into a new home with his wife and daughter on September 11, 2001, after receiving an assignment to staff duty under Lieutenant Colonel Bowers. As news of the devastating terrorist attacks that day break, Nelson volunteers to lead 595 into Afghanistan. Bowers initially refuses, but veteran soldier CW5 Hal Spencer, previously scheduled to retire, persuades Bowers to give Nelson command of 595 again, as well as volunteering himself for the deployment. After leaving their families, 595 travels to Uzbekistan on October 7, 2001. After being briefed and evaluated by COL Mulholland, Commander of 5th Special Forces Group, Nelson and 595 are picked to fight alongside Northern Alliance leader Abdul Rashid Dostum.ODA 595 is inserted covertly in Afghanistan aboard an MH-47 Chinook flown by 160th SOAR on 19 October 2001.[6] They land 40 miles south of Mazar-i Sharif, the country's fourth-largest city and a longtime stronghold of the Taliban, where they meet Dostum. Six of the 12 members, led by Nelson, leave with Dostum to the mountains, while the other six remain in a fortified camp nicknamed ""The Alamo"" under Spencer's command. Dostum is attempting to capture the northern Afghanistan city, while battling Taliban leader Mullah Razzan, who rules local communities brutally under strict Sharia law, and has murdered several people, including Dostum's family. Although the warlord is initially skeptical of Nelson's abilities, Nelson gradually earns Dostum's respect. In one battle, however, Dostum makes a tactical error, costing several casualties. Nelson accuses Dostum of acting carelessly with the lives of his men and of withholding valuable information, while Dostum retorts that he still feels that Nelson, and the U.S. are not willing to pay the potential price of the conflict, and tells Nelson that he needs to use his heart and mind to ""be a warrior"" instead of a soldier. The two eventually reconcile, and, after splitting off a three-man element under SFC Sam Diller to strike a Taliban supply route, and being joined by Spencer's half of ODA 595, continue to work together. They win several victories with Dostum's leadership and manpower and American airpower, making significant progress towards Mazar-i Sharif. Suddenly, however, Spencer informs Nelson that another ODA, 555, has been dispatched to support Atta Muhammad, another Northern Alliance leader, who is Dostum's political rival. When Nelson is forced to tell Dostum, the furious warlord and his men promptly abandon 595.Following Dostum's departure, Nelson plans to continue operating against the Taliban with his Americans and the few Afghan fighters remaining with them. Encountering a large force of Al-Qaeda and Taliban fighters and armored vehicles, ODA 595, rejoined by Diller and his element, uses air support to eliminate many of the fighters and most of the armor, but are discovered and attacked. Spencer is critically injured by a suicide bomber, and the team is about to be overrun under heavy Taliban and Al-Qaeda pressure when Dostum returns with his forces. Carrying out the U.S. Army's first cavalry charge of the 21st century, the American and Northern Alliance forces disperse the Taliban and al-Qaeda, and Dostum tracks down and kills Razzan. After Spencer is medevaced, Nelson and Dostum continue to Mazar-i-Sharif but find Atta Muhammad has beaten them there. Against expectations, Dostum and Muhammad meet peacefully and put aside their differences. Impressed by Nelson and the Americans' efforts, Dostum gives Nelson his prized riding crop and tells him that he will always consider Nelson a brother and fellow fighter, at the same time bidding him remember that Afghanistan is the graveyard of empires. Spencer ultimately survives, and all 12 soldiers of ODA 595 return home after 23 days of almost continuous fighting in Afghanistan.The film's penultimate moment shows a photo of the Horse Soldier Statue at the World Trade Center in New York City, based on the soldiers of ODA 595 and their victory in the early stages of the response to the September 11th attacks, dedicated to all United States Special Forces. The film then ends with a photo of the actual members of ODA 595, in combat fatigues, upon whom 12 Strong was based."

A Biopic on the life of the legendary American Astronaut Neil Armstrong from 1961-1969, on his journey to becoming the first human to walk the moon. Exploring the sacrifices and costs on the Nation and Neil himself, during one of the most dangerous missions in the history of space travel.—Matthew Villella In 1961, NASA test pilot Neil Armstrong is flying the X-15 rocket plane when it inadvertently bounces off the atmosphere. Although he manages to land the plane in the Mojave Desert, his colleagues express concern that his recent record of mishaps is due to distraction and he is grounded. His two-and-a-half year old daughter, Karen, is undergoing treatment for a brain tumor. Desperate to save her, Armstrong keeps a detailed log of her symptoms and feverishly tries to find possible treatments, but she dies soon afterwards. Grief-stricken, Armstrong applies for Project Gemini and is accepted to NASA Astronaut Group 2. Armstrong, his wife Janet, and their son Rick move to Houston alongside other astronaut families. Armstrong befriends Elliot See, another civilian test pilot, and Ed White. As Armstrong begins training, Deke Slayton impresses upon the new astronauts the importance of the Gemini program, as the Soviet Union had reached every milestone in the Space Race ahead of the United States. Armstrong and Janet have a second son, Mark. By 1965, the family has settled in Houston, and Armstrong awaits selection for a crew. After the Soviets complete the first extravehicular activity (EVA), Armstrong is informed that he will be the commander of Gemini 8, with David Scott as the pilot.. In the aftermath of a crushing family tragedy during the pressing Space Race with the Soviet Union, the humble and quiet civilian test pilot,Neil Armstrong, is recruited by the chief of the NASA astronaut office,Deke Slayton, for the ambitious Project Gemini, in the dawn of 1960s. However, eight long years filled with trials, tragedies, but also innovations, will pass before Armstrong--as the commander of the Apollo 11--along with the American astronaut,Buzz Aldrin, manage to land on the Moon the Apollo Lunar Module, Eagle, on July 20, 1969. On the arid and eerie lunar landscape dusted with powdery regolith, Neil takes the first step on the unknown celestial body, some 384,400 kilometres away from the Earth. What is it like to be the first man on the Moon?—Nick Riganas A semi-fictional account of the life ofNeil Armstrongduring his time in the NASA space program throughout the 1960s from 1961 just before being accepted into the Gemini program to the historic Apollo 11 flight to the moon - he the first human ever to step foot on its surface - in 1969 is presented, this presentation largely a character study. This profile is set against the backdrop of the space race between the Americans and Soviets, with the Soviets having beaten the Americans at every step along the way, hence the American push to be first on the moon arguably taking more risks than they may have otherwise to achieve that goal. Armstrong's stoicism is front and center in most situations, he largely displaying little emotion unless by himself, which also means not to his family including his wife,Janet Armstrong. The path to being chosen flight commander for Apollo 11 is shown to have been one of fortunate and unfortunate circumstances both for him and his colleagues, for him where some perceived he making missteps could have just as easily derailed his career.—Huggo In 1961, NASA test pilot Neil Armstrong is flying the X-15 rocket-powered spaceplane when it inadvertently bounces off the atmosphere.

Prior to the mission, See and Charles Bassett are killed in a T-38 crash, deepening Armstrong's grief at the string of recent losses. Armstrong and Scott successfully launch on Gemini 8 and dock with the Agena target vehicle, but soon afterward, the spacecraft begins to roll at a rapid rate. After nearly blacking out, Armstrong activates the RCS thrusters and safely aborts the mission. Armstrong initially faces criticism, but NASA determines the crew is not at fault. Later, White reveals that he has been selected for the Apollo 1 mission, along with Gus Grissom and Roger Chaffee.During a launch rehearsal test on January 27, 1967, a fire kills White and the Apollo 1 crew, and Armstrong hears the news while representing NASA at the White House. The next year, after ejecting from the Lunar Landing Research Vehicle in an accident that could have killed him, Armstrong is selected to command Apollo 11, and Slayton informs him that it will likely be the first lunar landing. As the mission nears, Neil becomes increasingly preoccupied and emotionally distant from his family. Just prior to the launch, Janet confronts Armstrong about the possibility that he won't survive the flight and insists that he should explain the risks of the mission to their young sons. After telling them about the risks he faces, Armstrong says goodbye to his family and departs.Apollo 11 successfully launches and arrives at the Moon four days later. Armstrong and Aldrin undock in the Lunar Module and begin the landing attempt. They realize that they are coming in too fast and are going to overshoot their designated landing site. The new landing site turns out to have much rougher terrain, forcing Armstrong to take manual control of the spacecraft. He lands the lunar module successfully with minimal fuel remaining. After setting foot on the Moon, Armstrong drops Karen's bracelet into Little West crater. With their mission complete, the astronauts return home and are placed in quarantine, where the film of John F.

Joan has a chalkboard in the trunk of her car.Joan invites Annie over to witness a séance firsthand. Joan seemingly makes contact with Louis, who uses a glass and a chalkboard to communicate.

Annie's arm mirrors the burning book by also catching fire, forcing Annie to rescue the book.Annie returns to Joan for help, but no one's there and she does not go inside Joan's residence. The camera shows us Joan's place is decked out in witchcraft paraphernalia, including a photo of Peter inside a ceremonial triangle and a symbol Annie recognizes from family photos.Annie learns that the symbol is associated with the demon Paimon, one of the kings of Hell.

Peter sleeps in his room in the background and is not awakened by the conversation.Disbelieving her wild claims, Steve accuses Annie of digging up Ellen's grave. When Steve refuses to burn the sketchbook, Annie throws it back into the fire, even though she presumes doing so will kill her. Instead, Steve spontaneously combusts.With his possessed mother hovering in the corner above his bed, Peter gets up to search the house. When Peter leaves his room the ladder to the attic is withdrawn missing. Peter finds his father's charred corpse. Possessed, Annie chases Peter to the attic. The ladder to the attic is now down. Annie jumps up and furiously pounds her head on the attic door after Peter climbs the ladder and retracts it into the upstairs ceiling.In the attic, Peter finds flies, candles, and a photo of his face with the eyes punched out. Ellen's body is gone. Annie suddenly hovers above Peter before severing her own head. Confronted by this horror and three undressed devil worshipers, Peter jumps out the window.Peter's head hits the ground below, which seemingly knocks him out. Peter rises after the oddly glowing light seen previously hovers around his body. Peter follows his mother's headless corpse as it floats into the tree house.An assembly of mostly devil worshipers in various states of undress greets Peter inside the tree house. There is one woman with long hair in a bathrobe. Charlie's decapitated head sits atop a statue of Paimon. Peter looks around with a dazed, flat expression and we're shown Annie and Ellen's headless bodies lie bowing on the floor, in front of the statue. Joan's voice calls Peter 'Charlie' as a woman crowns him, but welcomes Peter as Paimon while the coven hails the demon's arrival. The story ends with a shot of a model tree house filled with dolls that look like Peter, the coven, and the headless Annie and Ellen."

Linda (Michelle Rodriguez) and Carlos Perelli (Manuel Garcia-Rulfo) own a shop and have two children, Xavy (Alejandro Verdin) and Gracie (Bailey Walters), though it appears that Linda bears the heavier workload. Alice Gunner (Elizabeth Debicki) is abused by her husband Florek (Jon Bernthal), though he attempts to make it up by being sweet and sincere afterwards. Jimmy Nunn (Coburn Goss) kisses his wife Amanda (Carrie Coon) goodbye. The four men are seen being pursued by police after completing their heist. They make it to their safe house as a whole squad of cops follow them there. Just as the thieves are attempting to exit, the cops shoot at their car until the thieves' van explodes, killing all four men. We then see Veronica waking up alone.In Chicago, Jack Mulligan (Colin Farrell) is running for the alderman position of the 18th ward. His father Tom (Robert Duvall) is a former political victor who hopes his son will follow in his footsteps. Running against Jack is Jamal Manning (Brian Tyree Henry). Jack visits Jamal's campaign office, which is in a church, to essentially butt heads. Tom firmly demands that Jack win and to not be the first in their family to lose to a black man.The women have to bury their husbands. Veronica attends Harry's funeral, where his remains are laid to rest beside their late son Marcus (Josiah Sheffie). Jack is in attendance, and he tells Veronica that he knew Harry very well, so he offers his services to her if she needs him. Jamal and his brother Jatemme (Daniel Kaluyya) also watch the service from afar. Amanda and Alice attend the funerals of their respective husbands. Linda is at home and tries to console Carlos's mother Lita (Socorro Santiago), but she blames Linda for what happened to Carlos because she claims that he got into that life to support her and the kids, and now his blood is on Linda's hands.Veronica is visited by Jamal that evening. He tells Veronica that Harry stole $2 million from him, which is money he needs to fund his campaign. Jamal forcefully holds Veronica's small dog Olivia by the collar to prove he's not messing around. He orders Veronica to come up with the money within two weeks.Linda goes to her shop to find men repossessing everything inside. When she demands an explanation, she's told that Carlos was the one who handled the lease on the store, and because he was down on payments, the store no longer belongs to Linda. Meanwhile, Alice's mother Agnieska (Jackie Weaver) suggests that she support herself by becoming an escort. When Alice says she won't do it, Agnieska smacks her.Veronica visits someone over lewd photos involving a man having sex with a younger woman, clearly intended to blackmail him. She then goes to a bowling alley to meet a man named Bobby Welsh (Kevin J. O'Connor), who hands her a notebook left by Harry that details all of his heist activities. Veronica learns that Harry's next heist involved stealing $5 million.At a nearby gymnasium, Jatemme's guys find two young men rapping and bring them to Jatemme. They were responsible for guarding Jamal's money that was stolen. Jatemme orders them to rap again before he executes them.Jack is at a rally for an organization of his called Minority Women of Work, in which he sees that women of color can get their businesses off the ground. He is pressed by one reporter over another less ethical practice of his, and he walks away with his aide Siobhan (Molly Kunz). As they are being driven away, Jack complains to Siobhan about his insecurities running against Jamal and the pressure being faced by his father, but Siobhan simply tells him to suck it up.Veronica contacts the other three widows and arranges to meet them at a spa. Linda and Alice show, but Amanda doesn't. Veronica informs the other two about the situation regarding Jamal and how Harry left behind plans for the next heist. Although hesitant, Linda and Alice reluctantly agree to join when Veronica emphasizes how much of a threat the Mannings will be to them and their families.Jamal visits a church to speak to Reverend Wheeler (Jon Michael Hill) for an endorsement, though he appears to already be siding with the Mulligans. Jatemme also visits Bobby at the bowling alley to attack and torture him for information regarding Harry's notebook, which he says he gave to Veronica. He later calls Veronica to ask if she sold it, and she lies and says she did.At a nearby hair salon, Belle (Cynthia Erivo) watches as her boss Breechelle (Adepero Oduye) has to give up money to a large man sent by his boss. Belle presses Breechelle for doing so, but she explains that she has to give up a cut of her earnings to the ones who allow her to keep her business afloat, namely Jack Mulligan. After work, Belle returns home to her mother Suzette (Lily Mojekwu) and daughter Bailee (Bailee Brewer), only to get a call about another job, prompting her to leave immediately and rapidly run to catch the bus. She arrives at Linda's home to babysit her children. Linda goes to join Veronica and Alice at their husbands' old hideout where Veronica gives them money to get guns and a getaway van. She also gives them the blueprints for the heist.Alice goes to an auction to get a van and ends up paying more money than it's worth. To make things more difficult, Alice tells Veronica she can't drive, so Veronica plans to recruit Harry's old driver Bash (Garrett Dillahunt). Alice then goes to get guns and has a woman help her buy guns since she doesn't have the proper documents to purchase firearms. At the same time, Linda attempts to figure out the blueprints to the heist, but she can't make out the word on the paper. She visits a man whose house she believes to be the mark by posing as someone working for a company that owns the house, but she slips up when she mentions the man's wife, whom he says has been dead for four months. Linda breaks down when she mentions her dead husband. She and the man start kissing before Linda realizes it's wrong and she leaves. Linda later joins Alice as the two go to a shooting range to practice. Alice does well, but Linda turns out to be a lousy shot.Alice joins the escort site and starts seeing a man named David (Lukas Haas). He turns out to be a real estate executive and spots the blueprints in Alice's room, which he identifies as being part of the Mulligan home.Veronica finally meets with Amanda in a diner. She mentions not being able to meet with Veronica previously due to taking care of her newborn baby. Because of this, Veronica chooses not to mention anything involving the heist.One week before the heist is to take place, the Mannings visit Bash and murder him. Veronica finds out and tells the ladies that they need a new driver. Linda notices how fast Belle is, so she invites her to join the heist. Despite Veronica's initial reservations, she agrees to let Belle join due to her take-no-shit attitude.Veronica visits Jack to ask for help with Jamal, though he tells her there's nothing he can do, and that he learned from his father and Harry that you reap what you sow. While Veronica talks to Jack, the other ladies scope out the outside area to get a view of the external security. They also spend time at the hideout practicing how they will move the money around and how fast they need to move.Veronica goes to Amanda's apartment with Olivia to talk to her, but she is held up by her baby. Olivia then goes to a nearby closet and starts barking. Veronica looks over on the table and sees a flask...which looks just like the one that belonged to Harry. Veronica walks over to the door, wanting to open it and not have what she's thinking confirmed, but she grabs Olivia and leaves before Amanda comes back out. Amanda goes to the closet and speaks to the man inside...and it's HARRY. Veronica drives away feeling overwhelmed.A flashback then shows how Harry set up his guys with a decoy in the driver's seat, and he fired two shots to get the police to fire at the van just before he set off explosives to obliterate his men. Next we see Hary on a boat with Jack, as they have been working together, and Jack had ordered Harry to steal from Jamal. Another flashback shows how strained things got between Veronica and Harry just before the last heist took place. We then see back to 2008 when Marcus was driving and did an illegal U-turn to go back home and deliver something to Harry. He was pulled over by a cop and almost quickly shot to death when Marcus failed to show his hands. This broke Harry and left him desperate.Tom meets with Jack over Jack firing the campaign manager that's been with their family for thirty years. Tom curses Jack out and orders him to have Siobhan rehire the man, but Jack tells him that he can't wait for the day that he doesn't have to talk to him anymore since Tom won't be there.Just before the heist takes place, Veronica finds Ken (Matt Walsh), the CEO of the Mulligans' security company, and the man in the lewd photos she acquired earlier. They are of him with his niece. With her putting him in a corner, Ken gives Veronica the codes to the Mulligans' safe.The ladies then gather for the heist later that evening. Belle distracts the security guards outside by firing flares into nearby cars. Veronica, Linda, and Alice get inside with masks and devices that disguise their voices. They make it to the safe and take all of the money, but just as they head out, Tom emerges from his room with his gun and orders the women to drop theirs. He unmasks Veronica and shoots Alice in the shoulder, wounding her, but Linda shoots and kills Tom. The ladies run out of the house and head to the van, only to find Belle held at gunpoint by Jatemme, who was sent by Jamal to take ALL the money. Jatemme hijacks the van, but the ladies give chase and ram the back of the van, causing Jatemme to crash and die. Linda then takes Alice to the hospital to get treated for her wound.Veronica goes back to the hideout and finds Harry there. She breaks down, angry over his betrayal. He attempts to justify what he did as him having to look out for himself and his new family (Amanda and their baby). Harry turns to kill Veronica, but she shoots him dead first with the gun that Linda used to kill Tom. Veronica leaves the gun in Harry's hand and leaves with the money.Later on, it's heard that Jack won the election by way of sympathy votes for Tom's death. Breechelle then goes into her salon and finds a bag of money left behind by Belle. She is outside with Bailee as they drive off to start a new life together. Alice is now planning to start her own business, while Linda is able to buy back the shop with her kids.In the final scene, Alice goes to a diner to meet a friend, and she sees Veronica sitting at a nearby table. A man then enters and sits with Veronica. She gives him a large sum of her share of the money to the man so that he can help build a library, and she requests that it be named after Marcus. Afterwards, Veronica follows Alice outside and greets her warmly."
Truth or Dare,2018,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6772950/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A harmless game of Truth or Dare among friends turns deadly when someone - or something - begins to punish those who tell a lie or refuse the dare. Olivia Barron, her best friend Markie Cameron, Markie's boyfriend Lucas Moreno, along with Penelope Amari and her boyfriend Tyson Curran, and Brad Chang go on a trip to Rosarito, Mexico. In Mexico, Olivia runs into fellow student Ronnie who proceeds to harass her until a man intervenes on her behalf. The man introduces himself as Carter and eventually convinces her and her friends to join him for drinks at the ruins of a mission. There, Carter initiates a game of Truth or Dare with Olivia and her friends, plus Ronnie, who followed the group. Eventually, the game ends when Carter reveals that he deceived Olivia as a means of tricking her and her friends to the mission to offer them in his place in the supernatural game of Truth or Dare. As Carter leaves, he explains to Olivia that the game will follow them and they must not refuse it.. The film opens with a teenage girl named Giselle Hammond (Aurora Perrineau) crossing into Mexico. She stops at a gas station to get cigarettes, when the clerk receives a phone call. He turns to Giselle and asks ""Truth or Dare?"" Giselle is frightened and says she doesn't want to play anymore. Moments later, she takes a can of lighter fluid and matches, and she douses a nearby woman before apologizing and saying she has no choice. Giselle throws a match and lights the woman on fire.We then meet college student Olivia Barron (Lucy Hale) as she is making a video for her YouTube channel to encourage others to build homes for Habitat For Humanity. Her best friend Markie Cameron (Violett Beane) enters and asks Olivia if she is going to join her and their other friends in Mexico for spring break as will perhaps be the last time they get to spend this much time as a group before they graduate. Although initially reluctant, Olivia agrees to go.The girls join their other friends - Markie's boyfriend Lucas Moreno (Tyler Posey), drug dealer Tyson Curran (Nolan Gerard Funk), his sort-of alcoholic girlfriend Penelope Amari (Sophia Ali), and Brad Chang (Hayden Szeto) - as they take a trip to Mexico, spending a lot of the time posting videos and pictures.The friends are at a bar where Olivia sees a drunken Markie dancing with another guy. She pulls her away before Lucas sees, as Markie has evidently been repeatedly unfaithful to him. Brad goes to hook up with a guy as he sees Tyson and Penelope going at it. Olivia goes to the bar where a schoolmate named Ronnie (Sam Lerner) approaches her and tries to hit on her. A nearby patron, Carter (Landon Liboiron), tells Ronnie off and nearly gets into a confrontation with him until Olivia tells Ronnie people are doing shots nearby. Olivia and Carter then start to chat until her friends show up. They plan to go back to the room, but Carter convinces Olivia to get her friends to join them and go hiking up to a nearby mission.The group arrives at the mission, which has long been abandoned. Ronnie has followed them as well. Olivia walks by a broken urn with a skull on it and walks away because of a rotten smell. The group then sits to play a game, and Carter suggests ""Truth or Dare"". They have fun at first with dares like Ronnie having to give Tyson a lap dance, Lucas running around naked, and Penelope making out with Olivia, but it turns hostile when Olivia picks truth and Tyson asks her if Markie knows that she's always been in love with Lucas. When it gets to Carter, Markie asks him what his intentions are with Olivia. He straight-up admits that he needed to find someone who was an easy target and had plenty of friends that he could trick into going up there since he's okay with strangers dying if he gets to live. He starts to leave, and Olivia goes after him. Carter tells her that now they are in the game, and they have to follow the rules: Tell a lie, you die. Fail to do a dare, you die. Refuse to play, you die.Upon returning home, Olivia starts seeing ""TRUTH OR DARE?"" written on most things she comes across. She goes to look for Markie in the library and is then surrounded by other students whose faces morph into twisted grins with red eyes. They all chant ""TRUTH OR DARE"" until Olivia picks truth. She is asked to reveal what secret her friend is asking her to keep, and Olivia shouts to the whole library that Markie is constantly cheating on Lucas. He and Markie hear it, and he leaves. Olivia tries to explain herself to Markie, but she threatens to break her hand.That night at a bar, Ronnie tries to flirt with a fellow student named Alexis (Morgan Lindholm), but she is quick to reject him. Her face then morphs and she hits him with a ""Truth or Dare?"" Ronnie picks dare, and Alexis tells him to show off his penis to the bar. He stands on the pool table to do so but then feels insecure when another girl mocks him for it. Ronnie then decides against the dare, so then his own face morphs, and he steps on a pool ball, causing him to slip and break his neck against the edge of another table.Olivia and her friends are in Brad's apartment where they see Ronnie's death on video. Olivia tries to convince her friends that the game is real, but nobody believes her. Lucas leaves after getting his things, and he walks by an alley where he hears a voice calling to him and asking him to play. He sees the question as graffiti on the wall, and it starts to get burned into his skin. Lucas then calls Olivia to say he believes her now, as he picked truth and was asked how he really feels about Olivia. He tells her that he sometimes imagines what it would be like to be with her instead, even though he knows it can't happen.The group gathers at the house that Olivia shares with Markie and Penelope to tell Markie that the game is real. They realize it is going based on the order in which they played. Markie gets a text since it's her turn, and she picks dare. She is dared to go through with her promise of breaking Olivia's hand. Olivia grabs a hammer and tries to get Markie to go through with it, although she is reluctant. Olivia gets her to do it when calling her father a coward (he killed himself and Markie is still dealing with that).Lucas and Brad take Olivia to the hospital. It's Brad's turn to play, and he picks truth. He is then forced to come out as gay to his father, Han (Tom Choi), a homophobic police officer. Brad tells Olivia and Lucas that he did what the game told him to do, and his father was okay with it.It is now Tyson's turn to play, and he has his med school interview. The others try to go after him to stop him, but the interviewer becomes possessed and forces Tyson to play. He picks truth and is asked to admit that he writes fake prescriptions to students. He denies it, and he then becomes possessed. Tyson sticks a pen in his eye and then slams his head against the wall to drive it in, killing him. The others see this, as well as the blood under the door.Penelope is still reeling from Tyson's death, so she starts drinking heavily. Unfortunately, it's her turn now, and when she tries to pick truth, the game demon tells her it doesn't work like that, and she must pick dare. Markie finds Penelope on the roof of the house after being dared to walk around the whole roof while downing the rest of her vodka. The others get a mattress to catch her in case she falls, while Lucas stands on the roof to try and help. Penelope gets closer toward a fence where she could get impaled if she falls, and the mattress will not break the fall. Olivia gets into her car and breaks the fence down. Penelope finishes the bottle and falls as Markie and Brad place the mattress on top of the car, catching her.The friends find out about Giselle and what she did. They get in touch with her through a fake Facebook account and demand to meet up with her so that she can explain to them what is happening. Giselle responds and sets up a meeting. The friends meet her by a warehouse. Giselle explains that she and her friends were at the mission where one of her friends, Sam, had been messing around and breaking things, which may have been how the curse started, and now all of her other friends are dead. The reason Penelope couldn't pick dare was because the pattern went ""two truths and a dare"". When they ask about Carter, she doesn't seem to know who they are talking about. Giselle then reveals that she was dared to kill Olivia. She aims a gun at her and shoots, but Penelope pushes Olivia out of the way and gets fatally shot instead. Brad and Lucas try to wrestle the gun away from Giselle, but since she failed the dare, her face morphs and she is forced to shoot herself in the head.Olivia is questioned by a detective after what has happened. She explains what she learned about Giselle, and the detective shows Olivia pictures of Giselle's friends to see if any of them might be Carter or Sam, but Olivia doesn't recognize any of them.It is now Olivia's turn. She picks dare and is forced to sleep with Lucas. She tells Markie she picked dare so that her friends wouldn't have to. Markie leaves pissed, and Olivia admits to Lucas that she actually picked dare because there's a secret she is hiding from Markie that she can't bring herself to admit. She and Lucas start to make out and have sex until Lucas is up to play. He picks truth and must admit who he truly loves. He admits he loves Markie more. Olivia gets up and leaves.Markie is sitting outside a cafe watching a video of her and her father. The game demon takes her father's form and makes Markie play. She picks truth and is asked why she still keeps the gun that he killed himself with, and she admits it's because she sometimes thinks about using it on herself.The friends are at Brad's. He is outside talking to his father, who says he still loves his son. They hug, but the game demon makes Brad pick dare. He is dared to snatch his father's gun and make him beg for his life. Olivia and Lucas try to run outside, but a nearby officer fatally shoots Brad.Olivia is at the precinct where she is once again questioned by the detective after they traced the IP address to the fake account and found the message to Giselle in which Markie threatened to stand outside her family's house until the game dared her to burn them like she did the woman from earlier. The detective mentions Sam and shows Olivia a picture of him. It's Carter.Olivia reunites with Markie and Lucas outside. It's Olivia's turn, and she picks dare, but the dare is for her to admit the secret she's been keeping from Markie. Olivia tells her that she was there the night of her father's suicide. She had gotten into a fight with her parents and went to Markie's house, but she wasn't there. Olivia drank with Markie's dad until he tried to come onto her. Olivia told him Markie would be better off if he were dead, and Olivia could never bring herself to tell Markie. She leaves, now having no trust in her friends.Markie goes home and contemplates suicide as she takes out her dad's gun. Olivia goes to her room and manages to talk her out of doing it.After doing more research, Olivia and Lucas find an article on the Rosarito Mission where they played the game, which was the site of a massacre in which one woman, Inez Garcia, was the survivor. She was 19 when this happened 50 years earlier.Olivia and Lucas drive to Tijuana to find Inez, where she lives with her granddaughter. After waiting a while, Olivia and Lucas enter to talk to Inez, but she is mute and can only communicate through writing. Inez admits that she was a former nun who would face abuse along with the other nuns from the priest. She summoned a demon called Calax (voice of Gary Anthony Williams), leading to the priest's death but also a curse. Inez put an end to it by cutting out her tongue and placing it in an urn after reciting an incantation, which is what Olivia found to be broken at the mission.Olivia, Lucas, and Markie find Sam after Olivia got his address from the detective's files. Sam has holed himself up in his apartment to avoid being found by the game, but the three force him to join them to put an end to the curse.The four return to the mission. They make Sam recite the incantation, and the mission starts to crumble. Lucas is then forced to play and is dared to choose to kill either Olivia or Markie. He refuses to play, despite knowing what will happen. He and Markie share one last moment together. Sam prepares to cut his tongue out, but Calax possesses Lucas and makes him kill Sam and then slit his own throat. It is then Markie's turn, and she is dared to shoot Olivia. After a struggle, she shoots Olivia in the arm. Olivia then dares Calax to play, and he picks truth. She asks how they can get out of this alive, and Calax says they can't, as it won't stop until everyone is dead.Olivia and Markie run out of the mission, and Olivia starts to record a video. She informs viewers about the game and its consequences, says she is so sorry but she has to ask them: truth or dare? The video is seen all around the world and the film closes showing two girls who watch it in a bedroom. After Olivia's question, one of the girl's faces begins to morph."
"Love, Simon",2018,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5164432/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Simon Spier keeps a huge secret from his family, his friends and all of his classmates: he's gay. When that secret is threatened, Simon must face everyone and come to terms with his identity. A young coming-of-age tale about a teenage boy, Simon Spier, goes through a different kind of Romeo and Juliet story. Simon has a love connection with a boy, Blue, by email, but the only problem is that Simon has no idea who he's talking to. Simon must discover who that boy is--who Blue is. Along the way, he tries to find himself as well.—Paul Simon Spier, a high school senior, leads and has led what he considers a perfectly normal life. He has a loving family, parents Emily and Jack Spier, and his younger sister Nora Spier. He has a close group of friends, Leah, Nick and Abby, the former two who he's known almost all his life. Leah just transferred to their school, Creekwood High, this year, but they feel like they've known each other a long time. But there is a ""but"" in Simon's life, the big secret that he's been keeping now for a few years: he's gay and in the closet to everyone. He knows especially his parents would be all right with his homosexual orientation, despite Jack's often politically incorrect jokes, and that most of the students accept Ethan, their one and only openly gay classmate, but Simon has failed to come out for various reasons, mostly having to do with the change that would occur in what he has known as his life. He discovers that he is not alone: another classmate calling himself ""Blue"" (a pseudonym) is posting online about his own gay struggles in the closet. With that posting having an email address where one can respond, Simon begins an anonymous correspondence with Blue opening up about his own struggles. In the support they end up providing each other, Simon begins to fall for Blue not even knowing who he is. As Simon tries to figure out who Blue is, he starts to see his classmates in a new light. But circumstances lead to Simon manipulating his friends' love lives, all in an effort to maintain his secret.—Huggo The film starts with Simon Spier (Nick Robinson) as he tells us about himself. His parents are former quarterback Jack (Josh Duhamel) and valedictorian Emily (Jennifer Garner). His younger sister Nora (Talitha Bateman) is an aspiring chef. Simon spends time with his three best friends - Leah (Katherine Langford), Nick (Jorge Lindeborg, Jr.), and Abby (Alexandra Shipp). He considers himself fairly normal, other than his one ""huge-ass secret"": he's gay. Before he heads to school, Simon sees a man he finds attractive working with a leaf blower. He tries to talk to him but ends up being awkward.Simon picks his friends up for school. The only openly gay student at school is Ethan (Clark Moore), who is picked on by the school's resident jackasses Aaron (Tyler Chase) and Spencer (Terayle Hill). Their principal Mr. Worth (Tony Hale) always tries to relate to his students and always swipes students' phones for texting. Simon and Abby are performing in the school's production of ""Cabaret"", and their teacher, Ms. Albright (Natasha Rothwell) is frequently fed up with her students' lack of actual talent.At home, Simon is watching TV with his family when Jack makes an unfortunate joke about a guy on ""The Bachelor"" looking ""fruity"". Later, Simon gets a FaceTime call from Leah, who tells him about the school's blog where an anonymous student going by ""Blue"" has come out as gay. Simon decides to start e-mailing Blue under the alias of ""Jacques"" (as in ""Jacques a dit"", which is French for ""Simon says""). Blue responds to Simon, and the two continue sending each other messages and forming a strong connection.Simon is at the school library where he accidentally leaves his e-mails open. They are found by his classmate Martin (Logan Miller), who has a reputation for being extremely weird and annoying. Martin approaches Simon and reveals he took screenshots of his e-mails and is effectively blackmailing Simon to set him up with Abby. Simon is upset but also isn't ready for everyone to know he's gay, so he reluctantly goes along with it.At lunch, Simon's friend Bram (Keiynan Lonsdale) invites everyone to his house for a Halloween party. Simon starts to suspect that Bram could be Blue, based on their interactions and hints dropped in the e-mails.Simon and his friends meet up at his house, where he and Leah are dressed as John Lennon and Yoko Ono, Nick is Cristiano Ronaldo, and Abby is Wonder Woman. He invites Martin, to the chagrin of his friends. On their way to the party, Martin ends up trying WAY too hard to talk to Abby, and she is clearly more interested in Nick. At the party, Nick tells Simon he is thinking of asking Abby out, but Simon comes up with a lie that Abby is seeing an older college guy. Simon is then invited by Bram to play beer pong and gets Martin and Abby to play against them. Simon later goes upstairs to find Bram making out with another girl, to Simon's disappointment. To make things worse, Martin blows chunks on Simon after getting too drunk.Leah walks Simon back home as he wears her cardigan. They go to his room where Leah talks about loving one person for the rest of her life, meaning Simon himself. He doesn't get it and instead just goes to bed, and she sleeps on the floor.Martin urges Simon to move faster with Abby, or else the e-mails get leaked. Simon gets Abby and Martin to go with him to rehearse lines for the play at a Waffle House. Martin tries to engage in conversation with Abby, who is anything but interested. He prods her for information regarding her move to Georgia from DC, which she ultimately admits is attributed to her parents' divorce and her father being a cheating jerk. Meanwhile, Simon becomes attracted to their waiter, Lyle (Joey Pollari), who Simon now believes could be Blue. Martin then tries to get Abby to say her name and say she deserves a ""goddamn superhero"". Martin goes as far as to get the attention of everyone in the restaurant until Abby says it, which she does so he'll shut up. Simon walks outside as Lyle is sending a message on his phone. They chat briefly until Lyle goes back inside, and Simon gets a message from Blue, who is planning to come out to his father.Simon later takes Abby home and comes out to her. She says she is not surprised, even though she never suspected it, but she still loves Simon.Martin starts hanging around Simon and his friends, but is closest to Abby (whether she likes it or not). This bothers Nick, who still wants to ask Abby out. Simon tells him that Leah has a crush on him and that he should ask her out instead.The students go to their homecoming game. Simon sees Lyle and chats with him, but learns that he's straight and interested in Abby. As Simon walks away, he's approached by Martin, who's the school mascot. He asks Simon if he should make a romantic gesture for Abby, to which an apathetic Simon responds ""Go big or go home"". Martin uses this as an opportunity to pull a Kanye and interrupt the National Anthem so that he can ask Abby out in front of the entire school. Embarrassed, she gently tells him that she's just not into him like that. Martin walks away, humiliated.Over Christmas break, Simon tries to call Martin to see if he's okay. Leah then calls Simon to tell him to go on the confession blog. Martin, trying to throw attention away from his homecoming debacle, ultimately posts Simon's e-mails, outing him. Nora sees the post and asks Simon, but he coldly turns her away.Simon goes absent from his friends during the break. He comes out to his parents on Christmas, and they appear okay with it, but Jack makes another bad joke, and he and Simon don't speak for a while. To make things worse, Simon speaks to Blue one more time, and Blue chooses not to continue sending messages.Simon spots his friends on the street. He goes to talk to them, but Nick and Abby are mad at him for making up lies to keep them apart. Simon admits what was going on with Martin and he apologizes, but they leave. Leah also admits to Simon that she was in love with him and would have been fine with him being gay, but she is still mad about the lying.Upon returning to school, the other students all gawk at Simon after what happened. He approaches a student from his drama class, Cal (Miles Heizer), who Simon thought may have been Blue, but Cal denies it. During lunch, Simon sits alone when Aaron and Spencer call out him and Ethan and mock them in front of the cafeteria. Ms. Albright steps in and amazingly shuts the two bullies down and sends them to the principal's office. Simon and Ethan are forced to go as well so the boys can apologize to them. Simon talks to Ethan, who says that although he is open and confident about his homosexuality, it isn't at all easy for him, and his mother still pretends for the rest of his family that he is straight. Afterwards, Simon is going home when he is approached by Martin, who is very apologetic, but Simon tells him to fuck off.Simon talks to his mom, who has no problem with him being gay and says he should be free to be himself. He later talks to his dad, who apologizes for all the times he's made dumb jokes, and he lets Simon know how much he loves him. Simon then helps Jack come up with a good slideshow for his and Emily's 20th anniversary.Simon finds Leah walking her dog on the street. He apologizes to her for lying and admits that he has fallen in love with Blue. She forgives him and asks to know more about Blue.Simon then posts a confession to the blog where he accepts himself and also apologizes to those that he hurt. Just about all of his classmates and teachers read it. He adds an invitation for Blue to find him somewhere after the school's play. The students at school now have a greater respect for Simon.The school puts on its production of ""Cabaret"", which goes mostly well until the T on the sign breaks.

She expresses to Joan and her godson, Joan's son Dilly (Dalton Harrod) that her birthday wish would be to have gone to a fancy school and done so many exciting things with her life. Later, at work, Arthur is driving Maya and the other employees crazy when Joan tells Maya she has received an interview for a job at the conglomerate Franklin and Clarke - Dilly, a computer genius who is soon going to Stanford, has set up resumes and interviews for her as a birthday present. Annoyed with Arthur, she takes the interview but is shocked when she gets sent up to the top floor to meet with Anderson Clarke (Treat Williams) himself. He is extremely impressed by her resume - which includes Harvard, Wharton, philanthropy, and the peace corps. Flabbergasted, Maya goes along with it. He's interested in having her consult for them and brings in his daughter Zoe (Vanessa Hudgens). His VP. Zoey is cold to Maya, and when Anderson asks Maya for her real thoughts on some of their product lines, she gives them some real talk about their beauty products, which were not as successful as they wanted - which ruffles Zoe's feathers.Maya finds out she's been hired for the consulting job, but she at first can't imagine saying yes. Joan tells her she got the interview on a lie but got hired because of herself. When Arthur begins being difficult once again, she triumphantly quits. Trey is concerned about her going in because of the lie, but Maya decides she needs to do it. Trey has wanted a family for a long time, and Maya seems uneasy and unwilling every time he brings it up, but won't say why. Trey says they want different things and breaks up with her.Maya starts her job, and because of her comments in her interview, the product line getting revamped is the beauty line. Maya thinks they need to make all natural products, but Zoe insists they couldn't make it work and that they have an existing line - launching a new one would be too costly. Zoe wants to make their current line more organic, Maya wants to go all natural, so two competing teams are set up and given ten weeks to come up with a new product and pitch. As part of the job, Maya gets a new wardrobe and a massive new apartment. Joan presses her about the breakup with Trey and says Maya needs to stop punishing herself for giving up the baby she had when she was seventeen.Since the rowing team was listed on her resume, Anderson asks Maya to be the lead at a company rowing event. Maya completely messes up and causes the boat to crash, but Anderson finds the whole thing funny. Ron (Freddie Stroma), another co-worker, finds it suspicious and begins sniffing out Maya's references. Maya is also asked to speak Mandarin at a dinner with a Chinese distributor - and so Joan's veterinarian friend translates for her in her ear, causing some hi-jinks. After that dinner, Zoe softens a little and offers to send Maya her previous research on all natural products.Anderson calls Zoe into his office to tell her something important. When Maya goes to her apartment to get the files, she sees a lot of art on the walls - Zoe was in art school before leaving to join the company after her mother died, feeling her father needed her around. However, Zoe was adopted and reveals that she has just found out that Maya is her birth mother. The two are overjoyed to be reunited, and spend a lot of time together, growing very close. Maya was living in foster care and couldn't take care of Zoe, and is so relieved to see her doing so well. She encourages Zoe to return to art school. Anderson reveals that he had gone looking for Zoe's birth mother and found Maya online - which is when he saw her resume and called her in for an interview just to meet her, but he was impressed enough to hire her.Maya has the idea to make their all-natural product all in one, and her team continues working on it, still having trouble making it work. At the company Christmas party, Zoe's assistant Ariana (Charlyne Yi) and product scientist Chase (Alan Eisenberg) - who have had an ongoing flirtation - finally kiss. Ron, however, implies that he knows Maya is full of it and tells her that her product is going to be a ""disaster"" - which gives Maya another idea, to use silver gingko tree plants, which survived the disaster of Hiroshima. The product is finally working, and the two sides present their products. That night, at Joan's birthday party, Maya sees Trey again. He knows about Zoe, and tells her she didn't need to keep it from him and that no relationship can be based on a lie.Anderson tells Maya that her product has been chosen and that she has been selected to present it on a huge televised event. Meanwhile, Ron finally gets confirmation that Maya has faked her resume. Maya is giving her speech as Ron enters, ready to tell Anderson everything, but Maya does it herself in the speech, revealing the truth. She apologizes to Anderson and Zoe, but that without the lie a person like her would have never had the opportunity. She leaves, quitting. Outside, Zoe approaches her, extremely hurt, and wondering if it was all a lie. Maya insists it wasn't. Zoe is angry at her for leaving her again, but Maya says that no relationship can be built on a lie. Zoe angrily tells her she's returning to London for art school.A year later, Maya has made Monday Momz into a successful business (and app, with Dilly's help). Joan and her other friends from the value store all work with her there now, and she's even still friendly with Anderson. Trey comes to see her and makes her promise to never lie to him again, and they get back together. He asks if her if she wants to start a family, and she says that HE is her family - so of course. Finally, Zoe completes school from London and returns. Maya goes to see her and asks if they can start over. After a moment, Zoe agrees, and the two go on a run together."
The Commuter,2018,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1590193/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"An insurance salesman/ex-cop is caught up in a life-threatening conspiracy during his daily commute home. Former police officer Michael MacCauley, now a hard-working life-insurance salesman and caring family man, has been taking the commuter rail to New York for the past 10 years. Things take an unexpected turn when, on one of his daily journeys, cryptic passenger Joanna makes Michael a generous and tempting offer to locate a single commuter or face grave consequences. Is this a sick joke, or is this, indeed, a dangerous situation? As Michael races against the clock to solve this wicked conundrum, everyone aboard is a suspect, in a deal that is more complicated than it looks. Can he decide in time who is the one?—Nick Riganas Michael MacCauley, an Irish-American life-insurance salesman and former police officer, is a family man with a wife and teenage son. He goes through the same routine train commute to work and back every day, taking the Hudson Line from Tarrytown to Grand Central Terminal, often interacting with the same fellow commuters. His daily routine is interrupted when he is abruptly laid off from his job after a decade with the same company, leading him to wonder how he will pay his mortgage or afford his son's college tuition. On the train home, Michael meets a mysterious woman named Joanna who makes small talk with him. Joanna describes herself as an academic who studies human behavior and tells him there are 16 distinct types of personalities.. Every day, Michael MacCauley (Liam Neeson) goes through the same routine prior to his daily commute. He spends time with his wife Karen (Elizabeth McGovern) and son Danny (Dean-Charles Chapman) before boarding the train to work, frequently engaging with other regular commuters like Walt (Jonathan Banks).Michael works as a life insurance salesman. However, on this particular day, Michael's boss calls him into his office to tell him he is being laid off. Despite trying to argue against it, Michael is let go.Michael goes to a bar where he meets his friend, Officer Alex Murphy (Patrick Wilson), who was also Michael's former partner during his time as a detective. As they chat, there's a news story on TV about a city planner that supposedly jumped to his death several nights earlier. Michael admits to Murphy that he hasn't told Karen about getting laid off yet. They then find out that a former colleague that they don't like, Dave Hawthorne (Sam Neill), is now captain. He comes over to chat with the men for a brief moment.On the train ride home, Michael is told by Walt that a woman is observing him. Michael sits down and is joined by the woman, Joanna (Vera Farmiga). After a brief friendly chat, Joanna tells Michael that there is a compartment on the train containing $25,000, plus another $75,000 in cash. She tells him he can have it as long as he helps find someone at the last stop at Cold Spring under the name ""Prynne"". Before departing, Joanna hints at knowing about Michael being a former cop.Michael looks in the designated compartment and does find the money. When the train reaches a stop, a young woman finds Michael and tries to claim the money, but Michael decides to keep it for himself. The woman then hands Michael an envelope, saying it's a warning. Michael opens the envelope and finds Karen's wedding ring. Since he lost his own phone, Michael borrows the phone of another commuter, Tony (Andy Nyman). He tries to call Karen but cannot reach her. He tries Murphy and gets the same result but leaves a message. He then hears from Joanna, who tells him he's made his choice and must now find Prynne, or something will happen to Karen and Danny.Michael tries to leave a message on a piece of newspaper for Walt to contact the police. Just then, Michael receives a phone call from Murphy. After Michael tells him what's going on, Murphy mentions that a witness using the name Prynne claims to have seen two men throwing the city planner to his death. After hanging up with Murphy, Joanna calls Michael again and directs his attention out the window. He sees Walt about to cross the street to talk to officers, but someone working with Joanna pushes Walt into the path of a bus, killing him. She warns Michael that this is what happens when he tries to weasel his way out. She instructs Michael to find Prynne and a bag that they are holding, and to put a tracker they slipped to him onto the bag.Michael observes the other passengers in case anyone is watching him. He interacts with a few who just think he's weird. Michael sees one young girl, Gwen (Florence Pugh) with a bag, but when he follows her, he sees she's carrying fake ID's for her boyfriend. Michael then spots one young man, Dylan (Killian Scott), talking on the phone and carrying a bag. Michael follows Dylan, who attacks him in the next car for following him. When Michael mentions Prynne, Dylan gets suspicious, and the two continue fighting until Michael lets Dylan win so he can slip the tracker on him.A while later, Michael is called by Joanna again and he looks under the floor of the empty car. Dylan's body is stuffed in there with a bullet in his head. She blames Michael for this happening as he identified the wrong person. To make things worse, the police are coming after being told about disturbances on the train. Michael hides next to Dylan's body but gets locked in when a cop inspecting the car steps on the handle. Michael slips off of the train just as it starts up again and then rolls out from under it before running back to the train. His bag gets caught, and when he pulls it back, all the money (except for a $100 bill) flies out.As the train gets closer to Cold Spring, Michael gets more desperate. He pegs 5 commuters as potentially being Prynne since he's never seen them on the train before. After mistakenly thinking a man playing cards with Tony is Prynne, Michael follows a guitar player, Oliver (Kobna Holdbrook-Smith), into the empty car. Oliver turns out not to be Prynne, but an assassin working with Joanna, sent to kill Prynne. Michael fights Oliver for a while until they break a window, with Oliver trying to push Michael out, but Michael gets the upper hand and stabs Oliver in the neck before throwing him out the window where he gets run over by another passing train. He then grabs Oliver's gun.With two stops remaining, Michael causes the train's air-conditioning to malfunction so that all the remaining passengers move to the empty car where the AC still works. He then suspects a nurse, Eva (Clara Lago), of being Prynne. He takes her phone, thinking she is contacting Joanna, and holds her at gunpoint to tell the truth. Frightened, Eva admits she had a fight with her boyfriend and is trying to fix things up with him. Michael apologizes after realizing she's telling the truth.Once they reach Cold Spring, Michael slowly realizes that Prynne isn't anyone he suspected before. He recalls a young woman going to Cold Spring had switched seats after being next to an obnoxious passenger. The woman's name is Sofia (Ella-Rae Smith). ""Prynne"" comes from her reading ""The Scarlet Letter"" and its protagonist, Hester Prynne. Michael realizes that Sofia witnessed the murder and is supposed to testify with two FBI agents at Cold Spring, but since he refuses to give her up, Joanna declares via another phone call that everyone will die now.The train moves on, but Michael tells one of the conductors, Sam (Colin McFarlane) to stop the train. Sam pulls the emergency brake, but the train keeps moving because the engineer is dead. With the train set to crash, Michael and Sam try to unhinge their car from the rest of the train. Michael manages to get it loose with Sam's help, but the car is still attached by a chain. Sam helps Michael get it loose, but the train crashes with Sam still inside, and Michael manages to jump onto the other car, which derails and comes to a screeching halt on the outskirts of a train yard.Once everyone has calmed down, Michael asks Sofia what she might have that the villains want. She pulls out some kind of flash drive containing information that the city planner, who was a friend of Sofia's, might have known about. Sofia also mentions that she couldn't go to the police because the killers were cops. The police then arrive outside, believing that Michael has taken the passengers hostage. Murphy shows up and tries to talk Michael down. Michael helps a large group of passengers go out, with a few remaining on board. Michael tries to get Murphy to tell him what he may know about the conspiracy. Murphy mentions the phrase, ""There's no such thing as noble"", which is something Joanna said earlier, cluing Michael in to Murphy's involvement. After admitting his guilt, Murphy takes out his gun, telling Michael he's got his family to worry about as well. Murphy goes looking for Prynne. When Sofia tries to reveal herself, other passengers start saying they are Prynne as well. Michael and Murphy then fight while the cops outside try to get a clear shot at Michael. Michael manages to take Murphy's tracker, tricking the police. Once Murphy draws his weapon, Hawthorne orders the cops to take the shot, killing Murphy.Outside, Michael is reunited with Karen and Danny after being told that agents arrested three men outside their home. Sofia meets the FBI agents and gives her testimony. The other passengers consider Michael a hero. He then talks to Hawthorne, who says they will investigate Murphy and any accomplices he may have had. Hawthorne also suggests inviting Michael back to his old job as a detective.Some time later, Michael is back on the train, and he manages to find Joanna. Although she pretends not to know him, Michael figures he's got her whole scheme pegged and that it won't work now. When she asks him how he thinks this will end, Michael simply takes out his detective badge."

They boys are always interested in military drills & strategy plays, but keep getting into trouble at school over poor grades and deviant behavior.While working part-time at a local smoothie shop, Spencer is greeted by a Marine recruiter. He asks the recruiter what military branch he would select if he could go back and change. The recruiter replies that the Air Force para-rescue save lives and ""seem to being doing fine work in the field"". Spencer is intrigued by the recruitment speeches and decides to start working out to lose some extra weight he carries on his husky frame. After several months of rigorous training and exercise, he loses some weight and gets into much better physical shape. He enlists in the Air Force in hopes of becoming a Pararescueman.Upon completing basic training, Spencer takes his exams to qualify for para-rescue school. But, owing to having poor depth perception, he is turned down. Upset, he chooses from the other Air Force options left to him, and is soon stationed abroad. It is shown that in crisis situations, he is not afraid to step up and think differently to how he has been trained to respond in a given situation. His friend, Alek, enlisted in the Army, and has been deployed to the Middle East. On Skype, Alek tells him that he is planning to visit his girlfriend in Germany, and the two decide to rendezvous there for their next leave.

After a few days, they finally decide that it's time to visit France. They depart from Amsterdam Centraal station on the 15:17 train to Paris.On the train, all seems well, until American-born Frenchman Mark Moogalian notices that one of the toilets has been occupied for an unusually long time. When Moogalian goes to investigate, a terrorist bursts out with an assault rifle. Another passenger, Damien A., grabs the terrorist by the neck and Moogalian manages to wrest the assault rifle from the terrorist but is then shot in the back with a 9mm pistol. Passengers begin to flee out of their seats and rush toward the forward cabins of the train, trying to escape.Using a pistol, the terrorist shoots the passenger who took his rifle. Eventually, the terrorist approaches the next car, where Spencer and his friends are sitting. The moment Spencer sees him, he springs into action. He decides that his only hope, and the only hope of the remaining passengers, is for him to try to defeat the terrorist. Spencer makes a desperate all-out sprint toward the terrorist in the hope of subduing him before being shot. By remarkable luck, the terrorist's weapon jams just as he is about to fire, and he is tackled by Spencer, who successfully disarms the terrorist of his weapon. Seeing Spencer's progress in subduing the terrorist, Alek, Anthony, and other passengers join the effort to try to further overwhelm the terrorist, finally knocking him out.Spencer Stone then stanches the bleeding by plugging the exit wound in Moogalian's neck with his fingers. The police at the next station enter the train fully armed, discovering that Spencer has subdued the terrorist, and they begin to treat his wounds, and the more serious ones of the shot passenger. Paramedics take Moogalian to the emergency room at a local hospital and he survives.In a formal ceremony, Spencer, Alek and Anthony are recognized as heroes of the French Republic for their gallantry and bravery. The terrorist was later discovered to have been armed with over 300 rounds of ammunition with the apparent aim of using all of it to wreak havoc on all those who boarded the train. The odds of the particular misfire and jam of the cartridge in the terrorist's weapon was estimated on the scene as being over a thousand-to-one, and highly unlikely to have been in Spencer's favor. French officials at the ceremony to honor Spencer's selfless act acknowledge his bravery and he is awarded the French Legion of Honour in recognition of his act of courage. On September 22, 2015, Mark Moogalian was awarded the Legion of Honor by President François Hollande for his actions on the train."

En route, the team is followed by Axel's men on motorcycles, who plant grenades on Silva's van and blow it up. Some of the operatives are killed, and Sam is terribly wounded. Silva and his team open fire on Axel's guys, who return fire and continue to try and bomb them. Alice stays next to Li to protect him, although he helps get a few kills in as well. After doing away with most of them, Silva gives Sam two grenades, leaving her to blow herself and the rest of Axel's men up.Bishop guides Silva, Alice, Douglas, and Li to a restaurant where they have an inside guy working with them, so it is like a temporary reservation for them.

After a firefight, Silva goes back inside to find Alice and Li while Douglas keeps shooting back. He gets severely wounded until Axel walks up to him and finishes him with a bullet to the head. Bishop guides Silva to find Alice and Li. Alice has a brush with another henchman and almost dies until Li shoots the goon in the head.Silva, Alice, and Li finally make it to the airstrip, but Axel has found them yet again. Silva then has Bishop send a drone to blow Axel up for good. They then proceed to the plane where Alice goes with Li, who gives up the code to the disc. Before they depart, Li tells Silva ""Say hi to Mother for me."" Before Silva can get an answer, the plane takes off. Bishop then sees that Li's heart rate is accelerating. Then, the disc starts to upload what turns out to be a picture of Anatole. Meanwhile, Vera and her men prepare to watch something about to take place. It then becomes clear that Li was a triple agent working for the Russian government, and that Anatole was Vera's son. Her men find Overwatch and shoot the whole team, but Bishop barely manages to get out. Li tells Alice ""Gotcha"", letting her realize too late what has happened.In the final scene, Silva completes his debriefing and later places a picture of Li on his wall as he plans to get revenge against him."

The member is given a memorial service in the form of placing rocks to symbolize the passing of one's spirit to the afterlife.The hunters eventually reach a herd of steppe bison, which they attempt to stampede off a cliff in relative success. Amidst the chaos, a bison rushes Keda and throws him over the edge, leaving him gripping the rough cliff edge with his hand. Keda loses grip and falls to a further ledge where he appears to break his leg and is knocked to unconsciousness. Tau attempts to climb down to him, but he is stopped by another member of the tribe who assures him in good faith that Keda is dead and there would be no way to reach him nonetheless. The tribe leaves and Tau performs another funeral ritual, stricken with grief.Keda awakes and tries to climb the rest of the way down the cliff. A sudden heavy rainfall causes the ravine below to flood. Losing his grip, Keda jumps into the water. He survives and splints his injured foot before returning to the top of the cliff. Seeing the memorial cairn left by his tribe, he realizes he must trek back to the village by himself.He is attacked by a pack of wolves, but escapes up a tree, wounding one of them which the others leave behind. Keda takes pity on it and cares for its injury. Gradually gaining the wolf's trust, he gives it water and then food establishing himself as dominant by feeding himself first. He sets out for the village without the wolf, but it follows him. Their companionship grows, and they learn to hunt small boar together. Along the way, Keda names the wolf Alpha.One night, they are approached menacingly by a pack of wolves. They hesitate upon seeing Alpha, who steps forward and greets them.

Five years earlier, the same woman, Riley North, is working as a bank teller in Los Angeles struggling to make ends meet. Her husband Chris owns a failing mechanic shop. They have a ten-year-old daughter, Carly. Chris' friend tries to talk him into robbing Diego Garcia, a powerful drug lord. Chris turns him down, but not before Garcia has already discovered his involvement and ordered his men to make an example of him. Riley and Chris take Carly out for pizza and to a carnival for her birthday since no one showed up to her party. At the carnival, Carly orders peppermint ice cream. As the family walks to the car, Diego's men gun down her husband and daughter in a drive-by shooting. She is wounded, but survives. In Los Angeles, Riley North and her husband Chris North go to a carnival to celebrate the birthday of their ten years old daughter Carly North.

Chris and Carly are murdered and Riley survives, and Detective Stan Carmichael and Detective Moises Beltran arrest the criminals.

Riley vanishes and five years later, the criminals are found dead in the Carnival where Chris and Carly were killed. FBI Agent Lisa Inman goes to Los Angeles and explains that Riley robbed the bank where she worked and moved to Asia, where she became a fighter. Now she has returned to Los Angeles and robbed a gun store and is beginning her vengeance seeking out justice to her family. The police with the support of the FBI and Diego's gang are hunting her down.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Five long years earlier, the former Los Angeles bank teller, Riley North, was a doting mother of one, living a hand-to-mouth existence with her husband, Chris, and their ten-year-old daughter, Carly. Then, Chris, after toying with the dangerous idea of upgrading their lives, caught the eye of the pitiless local drug lord, Diego Garcia, and his murderous henchmen, who decided to make an example of him. Half a decade later, with her family decimated and the remorseless perpetrators allowed to get off scot-free, a now-off-the-grid Riley has re-emerged as a perfectly honed one-woman killing machine, bent on revenge and murder. Now, they all have to pay, and as the dauntless female avenging angel spills the blood of the wicked, no one is safe; not even the corrupt puppets of the ineffective justice system. However, can violence ever be justified?—Nick Riganas The film opens with what appears to be a struggle happening in a car. Riley North (Jennifer Garner) is fighting a gangster who slashes her leg with his knife. She gains the upper hand and holds a gun under his chin. Riley asks if he remembers her, but he simply responds with a defiant ""Fuck you!"" before Riley blows his brains out.Riley goes to an impoverished neighborhood where she hides out. She enters her van where she tends to her leg wound and has a drink. She goes through her belongings, and out falls a box of girl scout cookies.Five years earlier.....Riley is seen with her daughter Carly (Cailey Fleming) after getting into an argument with another girl scout's mother, Peg (Pell James), who complains to Riley that they were selling on their turf. Later, Riley and Carly stop to visit Riley's husband/Carly's father Chris (Jeff Hephner), who, unbeknownst to Riley, is arranging some kind of shady deal with his co-worker Mickey (Chris Johnson). Riley then goes to work at her bank and is told to close even though it's Carly's birthday.Riley goes home for Carly's birthday party, only to find her and Chris disappointed because nobody showed up thanks to Peg, who spitefully threw a holiday party and invited all the other kids, but left a voicemail just to taunt Riley and Carly. Riley decides not to let Carly stay sad, so she suggests they all go to the Christmas carnival. As they head out, Chris calls Mickey to tell him he's backing out of the deal. The family leaves, and they are watched by a gangbanger. He calls his boss, cartel leader Diego Garcia (Juan Pablo Raba). Garcia is in the middle of torturing Mickey, who was apparently trying to steal from Garcia with Chris's help. Garcia orders his guy to follow Chris right before he decapitates Mickey.The Norths enjoy their evening at the carnival and end the night with ice cream. As Chris and Carly walk back toward the car, three gangbangers drive up by them and shoot them. Riley gets shot as well, but she manages to make it to the bodies of her husband and daughter.Riley wakes up in the hospital and meets with Detective Stan Carmichael (John Gallagher Jr). He tells Riley that the suspects have been apprehended, and he gives Riley the photo booth pictures she took with Chris and Carly.Riley is brought in to identify the gangbangers. She recognizes all three of them by their face tattoos. Later, as she is packing up Chris and Carly's things, Riley is visited by an attorney, named Mr. Henderson (Michael Mosley), who attempts to bribe Riley into dropping her testimony against the criminals that he is representing. He also notices some medication that Riley is taking, but she forces him out of her house.Riley is brought in to testify against the gangbangers, but Henderson tries to use the medication thing against her by saying her memory was hazy or that she is mentally unfit to remember them. Judge James Stevens (Jeff Harlan) rules against Riley's favor and lets the killers walk. Riley snaps and tries to attack the gangbangers, but she is tased by the bailiff, and the killers laugh in her face. Riley is being wheeled away to a psych ward, and Carmichael hops in to join her in the ambulance, but she grabs an oxygen tank, whacks Carmichael across the head, and then runs out of the ambulance, disappearing.In the present day, Carmichael meets with his partner, Moises Beltran (John Ortiz), as they find the bodies of the three killers hung upside down from a ferris wheel.Riley goes to the home of Judge Stevens and ties him up after beating him and nailing his hands to the table. She makes sure he remembers her, and she tells him that the rope he's tied up with is explosive. Riley hops on a bus and then detonates the rope, blowing Stevens up. On the bus, Riley meets a young boy, and she gives him a toy that she swiped from Stevens' home. She notices the boy's father is drunk, and as they get off the bus, the man enters a liquor store while his son waits outside. Riley pistol-whips the guy and orders him to not ever drink again and to be a good father, or she will find him since she saw his ID and remembers his address. She then forces the clerk to give her his car, but she at least gives him money for it.Carmichael and Beltran meet with fellow Detective Inman (Annie Ilonzeh), as they suspect Riley to be behind these killings, seeing as how it is the five-year anniversary of Chris and Carly's murders. After the trial, Riley robbed her bank and stole military-grade guns from a warehouse before going off the grid. Carmichael then gets a phone call telling him about Stevens' death, as well as the fact that Henderson was found face down in his pool. This basically confirms for them that Riley was involved.Riley drives to a pinata store and kills the two men outside before entering. A firefight ensues, but Riley kills all the men inside except for one, Marvin (John Boyd). He later reports on what happened to Garcia, and Marvin gets killed for spilling his guts to Riley.In order to get rid of Riley, Garcia arranges for his men to lure her to a warehouse. She finds a bomb there and hides just as Garcia's men detonate it, obliterating the whole building. Riley gets out through the sewers and steals someone's car so she can go after the guys. She catches up, kills them, and then manages to drive to Garcia's home. Riley kills most of the men in there before making it to Garcia himself. She has his gun turned on him, but before she can pull the trigger, Garcia's daughter (who looks about the same age as Carly when she died) walks in. Garcia stabs Riley in the side and gets out with his daughter and his men.Riley flees and finds Peg's home. She punches Peg in the face and barges in to tend to her wounds. Riley has Peg tied up, pointing out that Peg's husband left her for another woman. Riley threatens Peg and even makes her piss herself before she leaves her there.Inman travels to the poor neighborhood to continue her investigation. She learns from one of the men there that the crime rate in that area went down because of the ""angel"" looking out for them. She is then met by Carmichael in that area. When she comes close to realizing somebody in the police department is tipping off Garcia, Carmichael reveals himself to be dirty, and he shoots Inman dead.Garcia meets with Carmichael in the area. Riley finds Inman's body and takes her phone to make a live video that hits the news. As Garcia and his men gather, Riley exposes Carmichael and Garcia for the scumbags they are, and she invites the police and the news to that area. Garcia then calls Riley out using a walkie-talkie and orders her to come out or he will execute a little girl from that neighborhood. Riley surrenders and approaches Garcia. He starts to beat Riley up just before the police show up. Thinking Carmichael set him up, Garcia shoots him dead. Garcia's men are arrested as he tries to flee, but Riley catches up to him. She holds her gun at him, and the police have their weapons drawn on her. Beltran begs Riley not to shoot Garcia, and he taunts her saying that she'll be in prison longer than him. Riley says ""We're not going to prison"", and she shoots him in the head, and the police return fire. Riley manages to flee, but Beltran says he knows where she's going.The cops find Riley at the cemetery at Chris and Carly's grave. She breaks down weeping as Beltran approaches her. Riley feels she is ready to die there, but Beltran says otherwise.Riley is in the hospital, and the news reports on how civilians see Riley as some kind of heroic vigilante, but the police say she will answer for her crimes.

In the early 18th century, England is at war with France; nevertheless, duck-racing and pineapple-eating are thriving. A frail Queen Anne (Olivia Colman) occupies the throne and her close friend Lady Sarah (Rachel Weisz) governs the country in her stead while tending to Anne's ill health and mercurial temper. When new servant Abigail (Emma Stone) arrives, her charm endears her to Sarah. Sarah takes Abigail under her wing and Abigail sees a chance at a return to her aristocratic roots.

She is shoved by another rider on the way out and falls into filth, and when she enters the castle, the maids play a trick on her and send her to meet her cousin smelling atrocious. Abigail's father has fallen from grace onto extremely hard times and Abigail is desperate for a job. Unimpressed, Sarah gets her a job in the downstairs, where she shares a room with all the other maids. The other maids bully her, even tricking her into touching lye with her bare hands, burning her right hand.Meanwhile, Robert Harley (Nicholas Hoult), a local politician with Parliament, is desperate to stop the war. But Sidney Godolphin (James Smith) argues the opposite to the Queen, insisting that the fight must continue. Sarah, who holds the most power to influence Anne's opinion, convinces Anne to double the tax on the citizens to pay for the new phase of the war, and Harley is furious.One night, Anne has an extremely terrible attack of gout and is screaming in pain. Abigail steals a horse and goes out into the forest, picking herbs to ease Anne's pain. While there, she makes eye contact with the handsome Samuel Masham (Joe Alwyn) but plays coy. She lies her way into Anne's chamber to apply her remedy, but Sarah catches her and orders her to be lashed. However the remedy works and Sarah stops the beating after only a few strokes and speaks with Abigail. She's impressed and takes on Abigail as her assistant. With this promotion, Abigail gets her own room away from the other maids. Abigail reveals that previously, her father had lost her in a bet to an old German man who she was forced to be with, and she will do anything to get out of that life. Abigail also coughs loudly in front of Anne, making sure to explain she caught a cold from picking her healing herbs.Part II: I Do Fear Confusion and AccidentsAt a grand party, Harley tries to talk with Anne about not continuing the war, but can never get her out from under Sarah, while at the same time, Abigail sneaks into Anne's chambers to take books.

They enter Anne's chamber and begin to have sex, to the shock of Abigail, who flees without being seen.Part III: What an OutfitJohn (Mark Gatiss), Sarah's husband, leaves to lead the ongoing battle in the war. Sarah is worried but resolved. Over a round of shooting, Abigail asks Sarah how she can be alright with her husband being in such grave danger.

Queen Anne tells Sarah she is not fired because she likes having her around... and likes sleeping with her. The three travel together awkwardly.

She wants to marry Masham, with whom she has had a continuous flirtation. Harley knows she can never do that, because she's not of noble birth but promises to make it happen, and Abigail meets him in the House of Parliament, telling him that the Queen is going to double the tax, and promises to get him meetings with Anne unaccompanied by Sarah. With that information, he is able to ambush Anne before her speech and goes onto to deliver his own speech, thanking her for not cutting the tax and ending the war to which the room erupts in cheers. Pressured by that, Anne faints, unsure of what else to do. Sarah knows someone must have gotten to Harley and set them up.Abigail gets more herbs from the garden and poisons Sarah's tea. Sarah then goes out for a horseback ride, and when the poison takes affect, she passes out and is dragged violently by her horse out into the country.

She slaps her across the face and then returns to her chambers and finds old letters from Queen Anne.Part VII: Leave That, I Like ItSarah (now wearing a black scarf around the left of her face to hide her ugly scar) goes to Anne and tells her that she needs to continue the war, double the tax, and remove Abigail from her service and move her away from them. Anne balks, and Sarah tells Anne if she doesn't she will release to the press, the love letters that she wrote to Sarah, causing a huge scandal. Anne is deeply betrayed.Feeling guilty for threatening Anne, Sarah burns the letters however she is quickly informed that she needs to return her keys to Anne's chambers and that she is being removed from the castle.

Sarah moves to a different estate.Part VIII: I Dreamt I Stabbed You In The EyeWith Sarah gone, Abigail has free reign, and spends her free days partying with the upper class and reluctantly tending to Anne, who by this time has suffered a stroke and is partly paralyzed on the entire left side of her body. At the same time, Anne is beginning to falter on the issue of the war with Harley and Abigail constantly influencing her. Sidney wonders if Sarah would have a different opinion, but Anne balks. When he brings up the idea of Sarah sending her an apology, Anne shows some interest but behaves as if it doesn't matter to her. Sidney goes to Sarah and convinces her to mend fences with Anne and write her a letter. Sensing Anne's pining for Sarah, Abigail lies and tells her that she's looked at the books and it seems that Sarah and John were stealing from her. Anne absolutely doesn't believe her. Anne gets more and more upset waiting for the letter from Sarah. It finally arrives at the estate, but Abigail intercepts and burns it.Later, Harley is trying to convince Anne to remove John from the military.

She insists that John and Sarah be banished from the country. Sarah and John are at home when troops arrive outside their place and Sarah sees them through the window.In the final scene, as Anne sleeps in her chambers, Abigail steps on one of the rabbits, pressing down on it with her foot.

At work, Paul tends to a boy who was shot in the leg. The boy tells Paul that he was walking on a street that is known as the territory of a local drug dealer called the Ice Cream Man (Moe Jeudy Lamour). Paul finds the street name and then goes to find the Ice Cream Man. He introduces himself as his ""last customer"" before Paul unloads his gun into the Ice Cream Man. The reaction following this is mixed, as people aren't comfortable with a random man taking justice into his own hands, but others think it's fine that he's going after criminals.Yet another gunshot victim is brought in, and this time, it's Miguel, whom Paul recognizes from a tattoo he spotted on him when he was at the restaurant.

The Spy Who Dumped Me,2018,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6663582/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Best friends Audrey and Morgan unwittingly become entangled in an international conspiracy when one of them discovers that the boyfriend who dumped her was actually a spy. Audrey (Mila Kunis) and Morgan (Kate McKinnon), two 30-year-old best friends in Los Angeles, are unexpectedly thrust into an international conspiracy when Audrey's ex-boyfriend shows up at their apartment with a team of deadly assassins on his trail. Surprising even themselves, the duo jump into action, on the run throughout Europe from assassins and a suspicious-but-charming British agent as they hatch a plan to save the world. The Spy Who Dumped Me tells the story of Audrey (Kunis) and Morgan (McKinnon), two best friends who unwittingly become entangled in an international conspiracy when one of the women discovers that the boyfriend who dumped her was actually a spy. Audrey (Mila Kunis) discovers her awful ex Drew (Justin Theroux) is secretly a spy when he shows up at her door with deadly assassins on his tail. Now a target as well, she and her fearless best friend Morgan (Kate McKinnon) must go on the run across Europe. The hapless, untrained pals team up with a British agent (Sam Heughan) who helps them navigate the world of international espionage. Directed and co-written by Susanna Fogel. Gillian Anderson and Hasan Minhaj co-star. In Los Angeles, cashier Audrey Stockton spends her birthday upset after being dumped via text by her boyfriend Drew. Her charismatic best friend and roommate Morgan convinces her to burn Drew's things and sends him a text as a heads-up. Unbeknownst to Audrey, Drew is a government agent being pursued by men trying to kill him. He promises to return and asks Audrey not to burn his things in the meantime. At her job, Audrey flirts with a man who asks her to walk him to his car. Outside, he and a colleague force her into a van and he tells her he is Sebastian Henshaw and that Drew works for the C.I.A. and has gone missing. Audrey claims she hasn't heard from Drew, and when she gets home she tells Morgan that Drew is a spy. Drew returns to Audrey's apartment to retrieve his possessions, including a second-place trophy he won for fantasy football. People soon begin shooting into the apartment and Drew tells Audrey that if anything happens to him, she must travel to Vienna and turn over the trophy to his contact. Drew is then murdered by a man Morgan previously met at the bar, who is himself a spy; Morgan then pushes him off the balcony to his death before he can attack Audrey. The film opens in Lithuania where Drew Thayer (Justin Theroux) is on a spy mission. He is compromised and found by his targets, who chase him through the streets. Drew manages to kill the gunmen before making it to the home of his main hit and blowing that man up.Meanwhile, in Los Angeles, Audrey Stockman (Mila Kunis) is given a surprise 30th birthday party by her co-workers, hosted by her best friend Morgan Freeman (Kate McKinnon) (yes that's her last name). One of Audrey's more obnoxious coworkers, Tess (Lolly Adefope), comes over and asks Audrey about her boyfriend, Drew, condescendingly telling her that Audrey doesn't seem like the type to go for someone like her, and Audrey is too embarrassed to tell Tess that her boyfriend broke up with her.Audrey later gets a phone call from Drew after he's been ignoring her texts, but he doesn't answer when she picks up. Morgan takes Audrey's phone and messages Drew that they are going to burn his stuff, which they do.We see a flashback to a year earlier when Audrey first met Drew in that very same bar. They appeared to hit it off just nicely. Then we jump back to the present where Audrey is working at a grocery store. A handsome man, Sebastian Henshaw (Sam Heughan), approaches her at the register. He gets her to walk with him to his car, only to reveal that he is an agent, and he orders Audrey into the van with his partner, Duffer (Hasan Minhaj). They inform Audrey that Drew is a CIA agent, which she was totally not aware of. They tell Audrey to report to them if Drew contacts her, and she mentions the phone call, but also that she didn't speak to Drew.Audrey runs home to Morgan, who had slept with a creep she met at the bar named Viktor (Dustin Demri-Burns). She tries to tell Morgan about what just happened, only for Drew to suddenly make an appearance in Audrey's room. She asks if he really is a spy. Drew tries to explain himself, but she sees a sniper dot on his head. Someone starts shooting at Audrey's room, forcing her, Drew, and Morgan to take cover. Drew gives Audrey a second place trophy of his that she planned to burn, stating that it contains something very important that is wanted by an organization called Highland, and that they must meet in Vienna so she can deliver it to someone with the code-name Verne. Viktor them steps out and reveals himself as an assassin before he shoots and kills Drew. Morgan shoves him out the window to his death. Audrey and Morgan flee the apartment.The two fly to Vienna after taking a whole stash of souvenir trophies in some luggage, and Morgan also smashes their phones for good measure. Once they arrive in Vienna, the ladies are picked up by a driver named Lukas (Kev Adams). Villains on motorcycles chase after them, and Lukas gets shot dead. Aubrey has to take the wheel and outrun the shooters, causing at least one to crash, and then having to throw off another one who's on the roof of the car. After he gets thrown off, he gets hit by a truck, and Audrey and Morgan ditch the car.Audrey and Morgan arrive at the restaurant to look for Verne. Audrey finds Sebastian acting as Verne to take the package that Drew gave her. He tries to explain that everyone in that restaurant would kill her for it. Morgan then sees their waitress is named Verne, and she tries to tell Audrey. Instead, she blurts it out loud, leading all the other patrons in the restaurant to pull out their guns. Sebastian shoots at them, although he gets some help from Aubrey when she takes a dead assassin's gun and uses it to shoot another villain. With everyone dead, Audrey and Morgan run like hell out of the area. In order to avoid being detected at the border, they steal passports from two Australian tourists.Sebastian meets up with Duffer as they contact their boss Wendy (Gillian Anderson). Sebastian realizes he got the wrong package, and Wendy reprimands him for his screw-up.On the ride to their next destination, Morgan mentions the first night they met Drew and how he told her she was too much for her over-the-top demeanor. She says it hurt her feelings but she didn't want to tell Audrey because she saw how much she liked Drew. They then drop the trophy and break it open to find that Drew was hiding a flash drive inside.Morgan gets in touch with her parents, and her father sets her up with a friend named Roger (Fred Melamed). He makes dinner for the ladies, but Aubrey starts to get sick. As she goes to puke, she finds the body of another man in the shower, the real Roger. Fake Roger brings out an assassin, Nadedja (Ivanna Sahkno). They order the ladies to give up the flash drive, and they hide in the bathroom as they try to find a safe place for it. Morgan tries to swallow it but cannot until Nadedja shows up and they are both knocked out.Audrey and Morgan wake up to find themselves tied up. They encounter Drew's parents, Tom (James Fleet) and Marsha (Carolyn Pickles), who turn out to be Russian spies posing as his parents. They threaten to torture the ladies before Nadedja shows up to get information out of them. Audrey says that she flushed the flash drive down the toilet. Outside, Sebastian and Duffer are sitting in a van as Duffer attempts to order their fellow agents to start blowing up the spot. Nadedja goes to her tools until Audrey and Morgan start buying themselves time by spilling secrets about each other. Moments later, Sebastian shows up after knocking out Duffer and helps the ladies escape. Nadedja goes after them as Duffer orders the strike. Morgan kicks a grenade toward Nadedja and hits her, but only burns her face.Sebastian drives Audrey and Morgan away. Audrey reveals that she kept the flash drive in her vagina because she knew it was too important to get rid of. He brings them to their headquarters to meet with Wendy.Morgan contacts an old friend - Edward Snowden - and gets themselves set up somewhere safe. While there, Sebastian tells Audrey that she met Drew while he was on a job, and he says that what Drew felt with her had to be genuine because he clearly felt something too. Audrey thinks she is unremarkable, but Sebastian reminds her that she knew how to use a gun at the restaurant, she withheld information even under the threat of torture, and she has managed to get this far in the mission. Soon, the group are found by Duffer, who wants to sell the flash drive to whichever mafia group will pay the most. Before he kills them, a backpacker that the three are sharing a room with enters and thinks Duffer is a robber, so he slams Duffer to the ground, killing him.The three take Duffer's body to dump, but Audrey takes his thumb off to use his phone to keep in touch with Highland. They want Duffer to make a drop with the flash drive at an event that night.Audrey and Morgan go in disguise while Sebastian attempts to catch the villains. They end up at some kind of show where Morgan finds herself performing a trapeze act, but unfortunately, it's with Nadedja. As she tries to kill Morgan, Audrey ends up running into a very much alive Drew. As he tries to explain himself to Audrey, he goes through her bag looking for the flash drive, alerting her to his true motives. Meanwhile, Morgan is nearly strangled by Nadedja on the trapeze, but she uses what skills she learned way back when to lift herself and cause Nadedja to fall and get impaled on a spike.Sebastian finds Audrey and Drew, just as Drew's fake parents come in to demand the flash drive. Drew fails to convince Audrey he's not bad, so he kills his fake parents and shoots at Sebastian. Drew tries to get the flash drive, but Audrey takes his gun from him and threatens to shoot him, only to reveal she took the magazine out. Police arrive, and Drew is arrested. Sebastian turns out to be okay because he was wearing a bulletproof vest. He and Audrey kiss. Morgan then contacts Wendy to tell her that the flash drive is secured, and she tells Morgan to let Sebastian know that he may report to work on Monday.Audrey and Morgan then head out to enjoy the rest of their stay in Vienna.Shortly after the end credits start, we cut to a year later where Audrey is celebrating another birthday. This turns out to be a cover as she and Morgan are now working with Sebastian to take down some villains."
Annihilation,2018,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2798920/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A biologist signs up for a dangerous, secret expedition into a mysterious zone where the laws of nature don't apply. A biologist's husband disappears. She puts her name forward for an expedition into an environmental disaster zone, but does not find what she's expecting. The expedition team is made up of the biologist, an anthropologist, a psychologist, a surveyor, and a linguist. It's been already twelve months since his last covert operation, and the rugged military, Kane, is still missing in action, presumed dead. With his wife--the successful academic biology professor, Lena--still grieving him, an unprecedented phenomenon in the swamplands of Florida will soon have her following in Kane's footsteps, as a member of a strong all-women team. So many theories try to explain the mysterious ever-expanding iridescent membrane which swallows the area; however, none was able to yield facts. What kind of startling biological transmutations lurk behind this bright and colourful kaleidoscope of horrors? In the end, what did Kane see?—Nick Riganas At ""Area X"", a government facility on the southern coast of the US, Lena, a cellular-biology professor and former soldier, is in quarantine. She undergoes a debriefing about a four-month expedition into an anomalous iridescent electromagnetic field dubbed ""the Shimmer"", of which she and her husband, Kane, are the only survivors. In flashback, Kane, an Army Special Forces soldier, appears in their home after having disappeared on a mission nearly a year ago. He remembers nothing of that time and suddenly falls very ill. A government security force intercepts Kane's ambulance and transports him and Lena to Area X, near where the Shimmer had begun to spread three years earlier.. After something happens to her husband on an above-top-secret mission, Lena (Natalie Portman) finds herself leading a research team in to an unprecedented biological disaster of alien origin. What they discover is truly inhuman beyond all comprehension. The film opens in a facility where a biologist named Lena (Natalie Portman) is in a containment cell speaking to men in hazmat suits while a large group of people are gathered outside listening in. Another man named Lomax (Benedict Wong) is questioning Lena regarding a recent mission in which only she has returned. Lomax says she and her team were gone for months, which felt like days or weeks to Lena. She confirms two of her teammates are dead while the fates of the other two remain unknown to her. She has no idea what she just experienced.We see something soaring up in space before it makes its way into Earth's surface. It strikes a lighthouse and soon starts to emit a mysterious glow.Three years after this event and sometime before her mission, Lena is working as a professor at Johns Hopkins, teaching her class about a cancer cell that appears to multiply. It has been over a year since her husband Kane (Oscar Isaac) went on a mission and never returned. Her colleague Daniel (David Gyasi) invites her to a barbecue at his house that he's throwing with his wife, but Lena says she prefers to paint her bedroom. Daniel says it's not disrespectful to Kane's memory for her to spend time with others, but Lena still declines the invite.Lena is still hurt over Kane's disappearance. However, as she is painting, Kane appears in the house. Lena tearfully embraces him. He has little to no memory of where he was or how he got home. Kane takes a drink of water and says he is not feeling well, as evidenced by the blood in the water. Lena rides with him in an ambulance to the hospital but, en route, they are stopped by government agents that sedate and capture them.AREA XLena wakes up in a compound formed by an organization called the Southern Reach. She meets Dr. Ventress (Jennifer Jason Leigh), who tells her that Kane was part of an expedition into a location outside the compound called the Shimmer, which formed around the area surrounding the lighthouse over the last few years. Kane is apparently the only person to have returned from the Shimmer, as his whole team was reported as missing or dead. Kane is in the facility, but he is dying.Ventress is set to lead a team into the Shimmer to find the source of its energy, along with three other women - Josie Radek (Tessa Thompson), a physicist; Cassie Sheppard (Tuva Novotny), an anthropologist; and Anya Thorensen (Gina Rodriguez), a paramedic. Thorensen introduces herself to Lena and invites her to meet the other team members. Lena chooses not to let them know that Kane is her husband and that she has a personal investment in the mission.THE SHIMMERThe team heads inside the Shimmer. The land is comprised of mostly plant-based organisms. After four days, the team appears to have no memory of how they got there. A lot of their equipment, including their GPS, doesn't seem to work there. They continue further into the Shimmer, documenting their progress and findings. As they head by a small shack, something pulls Radek into the shack and nearly takes her underwater until Lena goes in to save her. They discover a mutated alligator emerging from the water. It crawls toward the team until Lena shoots it dead. They then inspect the inside of its mouth and find that the gator possesses shark teeth, suggesting that there may have been some kind of cross-breeding occurring within the Shimmer.Lena has multiple flashbacks of her time before the mission, such as her final moments with Kane before he went off into the Shimmer, as well as an affair she had with Daniel before he signed on for the mission. It is later suggested that Kane somehow found out about Lena's affair and this may have contributed to his reasons for signing onto what appeared to be a suicidal mission.The team rows boats across the lake to head further toward their destination. Lena rides with Sheppard. On being questioned by Sheppard, Lena tells her she was in the Army and also that her husband was killed in action. She does not mention that Kane is her husband. Sheppard then tells Lena that she lost a daughter to Leukemia, and also reveals things about the rest of the team, like that Thorensen is a recovering addict and that Radek had been cutting her arms. Sheppard adds that nobody seems to know much about Ventress other than the fact that she has no friends, family, partner or children.The team arrives at Fort Amaya, a military base which was the previous headquarters of the Southern Reach before the Shimmer engulfed it. Lena notices more mutations at the base; even ones that are malignant like tumors. They realize that Kane and his team had also set themselves up at the base whilst they were in the Shimmer. They find a camera and watch a video of Kane cutting open the stomach of one of his teammates to reveal some kind of mass slithering inside in place of his organs. As the team moves further, they discover a skeleton that appears to have been destroyed by something that was inside the person (it's implied this is the man Kane cut into). The team starts to become tense over their discovery.At night, Lena examines a cell sample she gathered inside the Shimmer and sees it is undergoing mitosis, but not like a normal cell does. She later talks to Ventress, who suggests that Kane went on the mission due to a self-destructive need, something which she believes is hardwired into all human DNA. Lena realizes that Kane must have volunteered for the mission when he found about her affair with Daniel.Outside, something appears to break through the perimeter fence of the facility. Lena watches as Sheppard investigates, only to be grabbed and carried off by a large bear-like creature. The others fail to notice this.In the morning, the team proceeds forward through the forest towards the lighthouse. They spot Sheppard's shoe and Lena ventures deeper to try and find Sheppard. She returns when she finds Sheppard's mangled body lying by a tree.The team continues walking and finds an area outside a house with plant structures that are formed to look like human bodies. Radek theorizes that the Shimmer is scrambling the DNA of everything in there, which includes the plants, animals, and humans. They then set up camp in the house for the evening.Later that night, Lena awakens to find Thorensen holding her gun in her face before she knocks Lena out. Lena wakes up to find herself tied to a chair, along with Radek and Ventress. Thorensen has Lena's locket and realizes Kane is her husband. She has become paranoid and aggressive, and also suggests that Lena killed Sheppard. Just then, they hear what sounds like Sheppard crying for help. Thorensen runs to find her, but instead, the bear creature (which has a skull face) emerges and stalks the women. The noises it makes are Sheppard's dying screams for help. Thorensen runs back in and tries to shoot the bear, but it attacks her before tearing her throat and jaw out. Radek breaks free and shoots the bear to death. Ventress covers Thorensen's body.The next day, Ventress goes off to find the lighthouse herself. Radek finds roots and leaves growing out of her arms at a rapid pace. She tells Lena that she realizes the Shimmer just refracted DNA and the signals on their equipment as opposed to simply distorting them. Radek walks away and disappears before Lena can find her (she has presumably mutated into a plant structure).THE LIGHTHOUSELena then comes across the lighthouse and the land surrounding it. There are large crystal trees and skeletal remains sprawled all over the sand. The lighthouse is covered in some kind of plant-like material. Lena enters and finds a charred skeleton sitting against the wall and a camera pointing at it. She watches the video and sees Kane sitting down as he holds a phosphorus grenade while talking to someone behind the camera. He is heard saying he has no idea if he really is Kane or who he was this whole time as his sense of reality appears to have been warped. He asks the person behind the camera to take care of Lena before he pulls the pin on the grenade and blows himself up. The person behind the camera walks into view and is revealed to be some kind of clone of Kane, the same one that made it back to Lena.Lena goes further into the lighthouse and finds Ventress, whose face is twisting and contorting. She tells Lena that the Shimmer is of alien origin and that it is preparing for an annihilation. Ventress's body then dissolves into a bright form of light that morphs and distorts itself. It pulls in some blood off a cut on Lena's face before it creates a humanoid body for itself. It starts to mimic all of Lena's movements. Lena strikes it and it hits Lena back. Lena attempts to run out, but the entity grabs her and continues to mimic her. She finds another phosphorus grenade and puts it in the entity's hand. She takes the pin out and leaves as it blows up. The entity starts to transform into Lena as it is consumed by fire. It walks around until the rest of the lighthouse goes up in flames, which leads to the trees outside to collapse, and the rest of the Shimmer begins to disappear.We return to Lena in the facility as she finishes talking to Lomax. He confirms that the Shimmer is gone, but Lena still has no idea what happened to her. Lomax tells her that after the Shimmer disappeared, Kane woke up hours later and is lucid. Lena goes to his room to talk to him. They look at each other momentarily, and Lena states, ""You aren't Kane, are you?"" He replies, ""I don't think so,"" and asks, ""are you Lena?"" She doesn't answer, and they continue to stare at one another. They embrace each other, and we see both of their eyes start to glow and change colors."
Isle of Dogs,2018,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5104604/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Set in Japan, Isle of Dogs follows a boy's odyssey in search of his lost dog. An outbreak of dog flu has spread through the city of Megasaki, Japan, and Mayor Kobayashi has demanded all dogs to be sent to Trash Island. On the island, a young boy named Atari sets out to find his lost dog, Spots, with the help of five other dogs... with many obstacles along the way.—Mike202 As a virulent canine flu ravages technologically advanced Megasaki from end to end, unscrupulous mayor Kobayashi decrees that all dogs be banished to Trash Island. But talk is cheap; the best time to take action is now. So, to track down his beloved four-legged companion Spots, Kobayashi's courageous 12-year-old orphaned nephew Atari embarks on a dangerous, nearly impossible rescue mission. However, to reunite with his best friend, the boy will need all the help he can get, including unexpected allies. But who knows what has become of Spots, the Isle of Dogs' hapless prisoner zero?—Nick Riganas Prologue: The Boy Samurai and The Headless Ancestor
The film opens with a legend of a war between three clans. Two of them worshiped dogs while the Kobayashi clan were cat lovers. The clans fought in battle until a child warrior came forth and decapitated the head of the Kobayashi clan. Centuries later, the Kobayashi family has not forgiven their greatest defeat.We jump ahead to twenty years in the future from now in the Japanese city of Megasaki. An outbreak of ""snout fever"" has been infecting dogs across the country. Mayor Kobayashi (Kunichi Nomura) issues a decree that will send all dogs to a quarantined piece of land they call Trash Island. The first dog sent there is Spots (Liev Schrieber), the pet/bodyguard of Kobayashi's orphaned nephew Atari (Koyu Rankin). The head of the Science Party, Professor Watanabe (Akira Ito), believes the dogs can be cured. Interpreter Nelson (Frances McDormand)(who translates and commentates on major events in the city) muses ""Whatever happened to man's best friend?""Part One: The Little Pilot
On Trash Island, there is a pack of five dogs - Rex (Edward Norton), King (Bob Balaban), Duke (Jeff Goldblum), Boss (Bill Murray), and their leader, Chief (Bryan Cranston). The city imports bags of garbage as a means of food for the dogs. One bag drops, and Chief's pack comes across a rival pack of dogs. They get into a wild fight for the garbage, with Chief even biting off another dog's ear. His pack comes out victorious, but Rex, who is a former house pet, says he can't stomach anymore of the garbage. King, Boss, and Duke agree, as they were also domesticated, but Chief, a stray, is more thankful for what they have. The dogs then spot a female dog, Nutmeg (Scarlett Johansson), walking by.A plane flown by Atari comes crashing down to the island. The dogs go after him when they see the wreckage. Atari has a piece of the plane stuck in his head. He sees the dogs and uses a picture to tell them he is looking for Spots. The dogs don't know him personally, but they know he's the first dog who was sent there. They bring Atari to what they believe is his cage, where a dog skeleton lies because none of the other dogs knew how to open it. Atari becomes distraught and enraged.We see a flashback to when Atari first got Spots after the train accident that killed his parents. Atari lost his right kidney in the same accident. Kobayashi's Major-Domo (Akira Takayama) brings Spots in and doesn't appear to approve of Atari treating Spots like a pet. Atari begins to whisper to Spots, and, with tears in his eyes, he tells the boy he can understand him.Atari attempts to leave the island. Rex notices Boss wearing the collar of the dog in the cage, and sees that the tag says ""Sport"" and not Spots. After Atari crashes the plane again, the dogs decide to help him look for Spots, but Chief doesn't trust Atari and refuses to help him, but the dogs overrule his decision.At night, Chief meets Nutmeg formally. He pries into her life by asking about who she's mating with, which she doesn't approve of. After apologizing, he gets to talk to her more. Nutmeg says she is a former show dog who could perform tricks. She asks Chief if he is going to help Atari since boys like him love dogs. Chief is unsure, but ultimately agrees to go along with the mission.At a lab in the city, Watanabe successfully discovers the cure for the canine flu. He and his assistant scientist, Yoko Ono (Yoko Ono), present their discovery to Kobayashi, but he dismisses it and plans to keep the dogs on Trash Island. He leaves the room, at which point Watanabe sees a file containing classified information regarding the canine flu and Trash Island, but the Major-Domo swipes it away from Watanabe before he can find out anything.Part Two: The Search For Spots
On their way to find Spots, the dogs start talking about their favorite foods. When they ask Chief, he reveals to them that he wasn't always a stray. He was owned by a family until he bit the hand of the oldest boy when he tried to pet Chief. He claims it was so bad that he almost bit the boy's hand off completely. The family locked him in a shed, but the grandmother brought him a bowl of hibachi chili, which he says was his favorite food. He dug his way out and became a stray.A rescue team searching for Atari comes down along with a drone and a robot dog. The captors trap Atari, but the pack intervenes to fight them off and save Atari. Chief battles the robot dog and gets injured, but Atari is set free and he disables the robot dog. The drone also ends up crashing down to the ground.At a school in Megasaki City, exchange student Tracy Walker (Greta Gerwig) presents a theory to her class that involves a conspiracy within the Kobayashi party, and she plans to do whatever it takes to prove that the mayor is corrupt. She organizes a televised rally with the other children to call for a reform in the way they are handling the dog situation. The kids hold up pictures of their dogs, and we learn that Tracy is Nutmeg's owner.Atari and the dogs set out to find the dogs Jupiter (F. Murray Abraham) and Oracle (Tilda Swinton), as they are known as the wisest dogs on the island. Oracle supposedly has ""visions"", but she is actually just able to understand the TV and translate what's happening. Upon finding them, Jupiter and Oracle recognize Spots in his picture as ""Dog Zero"". Jupiter suggests that Spots may be on the island as a prisoner of a group of cannibal aboriginal dogs.The group attempts to head further to find Spots, but Chief and Atari get split up from the other four dogs. After they land, Atari attempts to play with Chief, who is reluctant at first, but eventually warms up to the boy. He even lets Atari pet him. He then gives Chief a bath, completely removing the filth off of him to reveal that he is the same breed as Spots.Back in Megasaki, a chef is preparing sushi. He dabs one of the rolls with poisoned wasabi and has it sent to the room of Professor Watanabe. He is reported dead in the morning from what is believed to have been a suicide. Tracy continues her investigation into the matter, even going to confront a devastated Yoko to confirm that the cure exists. Yoko gives it to Tracy so she can set out to expose the truth.Part Three: The Rendez-Vous
Atari and Chief reunite with Rex, Boss, King, and Duke as they reach a bridge that will lead them to the aboriginal tribe. The four dogs get stuck on the trash lift that they came in on, but Atari and Chief make it across. They are confronted once again by Kobayashi's men, plus more robot dogs. Just when it looks like time is up for the two, they are found by none other than SPOTS.Another flashback shows Spots being found by the group of aboriginal dogs, but he learns from their leader, Gondo (Harvey Keitel), that they only ate their former leader because he was already sick and dying, and so the other dogs had no choice but to eat him since there was little else for them to survive off of. Gondo admits that this really hurt him and the others, but he doesn't like that they have a reputation as cannibal dogs. They find a key for Spots's cage, and they free him. Spots then meets his future mate, Peppermint (Kara Hayward).Back in the present, Spots uses his military-issued explosive teeth to take out the robot dogs. Spots takes Chief and Atari and jumps into the river to escape the others. While they float away, Spots tells Atari that he can no longer serve him and be his bodyguard because of his new role in the tribe, and because he and Peppermint are going to be parents. He also confirms to Chief that they are brothers. Chief is at first disgusted with Spots since Atari went through all this just for him, but Spots then decides that he may now pass his former role onto Chief. Atari places Spots's mic and earpiece onto Chief, who accepts his new role.Part Four: Atari's Lantern
Atari, Chief, and Spots encounter a messenger owl sent to them from Jupiter. They learn that Kobayashi is planning to take care of the city's dog problem by effectively poisoning them with gas. Atari leads his dogs to head out on rafts back toward the city to stop this.The city is gathered for Kobayashi's election ceremony. Atari is believed to have been dead after the bridge jump. Tracy and her classmates arrive to protest, with Tracy trying to expose Kobayashi's corruption, as well as the fact that he and his team manufactured the canine flu out of their hatred for dogs, and the fact that Watanabe was murdered. As a result, she has her student visa nullified and is set to be deported. Atari, Chief, and the other dogs arrive. They administer the cure to Chief, who is immediately relieved of the canine flu. Atari then stands up to speak and deliver a speech and a haiku, which moves Kobayashi to tears and causes him to have a change of heart. He undoes the Trash Island Decree and admits to his corruption and acting dishonorably. He tries to cancel the poisoning, but the Major-Domo tries to see the extermination through. They press a button and activate the poison, but thanks to one of Tracy's hacker friends, the poison backfires and affects the robot dogs and exterminators on the island. A robot dog then tries to attack Atari and the other dogs, but Spots intervenes and fights the robot dog. It is destroyed, but Spots loses an eye, and Atari has a metal part lodged in his head.Atari undergoes a successful brain surgery, but his remaining kidney has failed. Kobayashi decides to donate his left kidney to save his nephew's life.Kobayashi and his whole party are locked up for their crimes. Due to the election law, Atari becomes the new mayor of Megasaki. He makes it so that all dogs are returned to their owners and that they may return to society. This helps former dog-based businesses return, including a dog treat factory that the other dogs loved. Atari and Tracy become a couple, which allows Chief to get closer to Nutmeg.The last we see is Spots (now sporting a mechanical eye) with Peppermint and their puppies, living in the Kobayashi manor in peace."

Her life is organized on lists, one such a checklist of qualities of her perfect man. She has this checklist much like her mother Lola did as Danica wants her love life to be a magical one just like her parents'. She thought her boyfriend of six years Bailey was the man, that is until he left her for another woman breaking their engagement after she bought a wedding dress she still holds onto. Now she believes her boyfriend of one year, Charlie, who she met online, is that perfect man, despite they never yet having met as he works as an executive on a oil rig, and beyond he having sent photographs, they not even having video chatted in the Internet connection aboard the rig being bad. Knowing about Charlie doesn't stop good-hearted Frank, the owner of the coffee shop next to her office from letting her know that he is interested in her. She, in turn, won't even acknowledge his interest in deference to Charlie. While not meeting many of the items on her checklist, Danica further dismisses Frank when she learns that while he has turned his life around, he is a recovering addict and ex-con originally from the wrong side of the tracks. Conversely, Tanya, who has been in and out of prison over her life, lives for the here and now, easily moving from one thing or person to the next, while defending those she loves if she believes they've been wronged, like she believes Bailey wronged Danica, to which Kalli can attest despite Danica putting up a façade of he breaking up with her being for the best. When Tanya is released from prison after her latest five year stint, Danica is forced to take her in. While Danica feels like she has to guide directionless Tanya to help her get on her feet, it may be Tanya who is more of a guiding force for Danica in seeing life in front of them as opposed to Danica's nose stuck in lists.—Huggo The film opens with Danica (Tika Sumpter) starting her day by dancing to a Janet Jackson song as she answers a quick call from Charlie (Mehcad Brooks), her boyfriend that she has met online over a year ago but has never actually met in person. She heads to her job at an ad agency where she and her best friend Kalli (Amber Riley) are set to headline a special project.Danica and Kalli go into her office as Danica receives a phone call from her mother Lola (Whoopi Goldberg), who informs her that Danica's sister Tanya (Tiffany Haddish) is about to leave prison after five years. The news isn't good for either of them because of how reckless Tanya is known to be, but Danica inadvertently agrees to pick Tanya up and let her stay at her place.Danica and Kalli arrive at the prison to pick Tanya up and find her having sex in the back of a car with a man who is visiting his wife. Tanya quickly joins her sister as they head back to the apartment. Charlie calls Danica just as Tanya comes out wearing a wedding dress Danica had bought for a previous fiance. Danica snaps and yells at Tanya to take it off, then has to explain herself to Charlie. Kalli goes to help Tanya take the dress off as she explains to Tanya that Danica's last boyfriend, Bailey (Adrian Conrad), dumped Danica right before their wedding after meeting another woman, and Danica acts like she's happy and even plans on going to their wedding, but Kalli knows Danica was in a really bad place, and the fact that she has never actually met Charlie in person has her concerned. Tanya suspects that Danica is getting cat-fished, and she plans to get to the bottom of things.The next day, Danica takes Tanya to the coffee shop next to her job, which is run by Frank (Omari Hardwick), who always gives Danica free coffee because he has a crush on her. Danica arranges with frank to hook Tanya up with a job. He allows it and lets Tanya do an application immediately, even though she doesn't seem to be taking things too seriously.Danica tries her pitch at work with her team, which their boss Lauren (Missi Pyle) is on their backs about. Meanwhile, Tanya messes around at work and asks for too many demands, but Frank lets her use his computer to send an email. During work, Danica stops in, just as Bailey is there with his new fiance Amanda (Candace West). Tanya threatens violence against both of them, but Frank and Danica stop her from doing so.After work, Tanya helps Frank set up for an AA meeting. Danica walks in and overhears Frank talking about his past life as an addict and a felon.The people Tanya e-mailed were Nev Schulman and Max Joseph from ""Catfish"". They get in touch with Tanya and meet her at Danica's apartment to try and trace back Charlie's number, though Tanya tries to aggressively flirt with Nev and Max. Danica and Kalli come home to find everyone there, just as Nev and Max trace back Charlie's number and find a picture of someone who is definitely not Charlie. Danica waits for hours for Charlie to call so they can see what's up, but Nev and Max eventually leave with their crew. Danica continues to wait all night for the call and forgets to work on her pitch for her project.Danica goes to work and fails to deliver her pitch, so Lauren suspends her indefinitely until she sorts things out. She also tells Tanya to leave because she's annoyed at her for interfering. Tanya tries to go to Lola's house, but she doesn't want Tanya staying there at all, so Lola goes to Danica's place to cheer her up and convince her to take Tanya back. After the sisters reconcile, they resolve to go find who cat-fished her since Tanya got his address.Danica, Tanya, and Kalli drive to what appears to be a trailer park. They find the man, Lawrence (Chris Rock), who recognizes Danica and admits he used an app on his phone to try an make him sound like Idris Elba, and is also in a wheelchair. The ladies leave, but not before Tanya lights Lawrence's Jheri curl on fire, at which point Lawrence runs out of his chair and into a pool.Frank later visits Danica, and the two spend hours talking and connecting before finally having sex. Afterwards, Danica simply asks Frank to leave. She gets on the phone with Kalli and talks about what happened, but she is hesitant to be with Frank because of his past with addiction and jail, which he happens to overhear because he can't find his keys.Danica goes to find Frank and apologize for how she acted, and the two eventually start an ongoing relationship, and Danica manages to win over her superiors with her pitch at work. However, things get complicated when it turns out that Charlie is, in fact, real. He shows up when Danica is back at work, and he properly explains himself for constantly being unable to see her, and the fact that Lawrence used to be a coach of his that happened to steal Charlie's identity. Although taken back, Danica agrees to meet with Charlie for lunch. Just as they are doing so, Frank is getting ready to bring Danica flowers, but he sees her and Charlie walking together. Frank calls her phone, but he overhears her tell Charlie that Frank is just someone she knows. He confronts her and tells her to fuck off.Danica goes out on a date with Charlie that night. To her dismay, Charlie turns out to be full of himself and generally unappealing. Danica gets drunk enough to consider hooking up, so they go back to Charlie's place to hook up, but he merely dry humps her until he climaxes. He calls her an Uber (well, an Uber Pool) to send her home.Danica returns home to find Tanya angrily confronting her over hurting Frank's feelings and claiming to have slept with Frank. When he shows up to pick up his things, Danica questions Frank about sleeping with Tanya, which she admits was a lie. He tells Danica off for breaking his heart since he loved her, and he tells her he doesn't want to see her again.Lola meets with her daughters and admits that several things she told them about their father wasn't true because she doesn't even know who he really was. This makes Danica think over her preconceived ideas over what her ideal man should be, and so she heads out to find Frank. She gives him a heartfelt apology, but he continues to ignore her. Danica then goes to her car to blast a romantic R&B song on the radio, but Frank still won't come out. It then starts to rain hard, and Frank notices that Danica is still there. He runs outside to embrace her as he forgives her.Before the credits roll, Tanya decides to crash Bailey and Amanda's wedding to trash them both for doing Danica wrong before Tanya leaps onto both of them."
Adrift,2018,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6306064/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A true story of survival, as a young couple's chance encounter leads them first to love, and then on the adventure of a lifetime as they face one of the most catastrophic hurricanes in recorded history. Starring Shailene Woodley and Sam Claflin, Adrift is based on the inspiring true story of two free spirits whose chance encounter leads them first to love, and then to the adventure of a lifetime. As the two avid sailors set out on a journey across the ocean, Tami Oldham (Woodley) and Richard Sharp (Claflin) couldn't anticipate they would be sailing directly into one of the most catastrophic hurricanes in recorded history. In the aftermath of the storm, Tami awakens to find Richard badly injured and their boat in ruins. With no hope for rescue, Tami must find the strength and determination to save herself and the only man she has ever loved. Adrift is the unforgettable story about the resilience of the human spirit and the transcendent power of love.—STXfilms October 1983. Following the harrowing and heartbreaking story ofTami Ashcraft, and her kindred spirit,Richard Sharp, ""Adrift"" portrays the couple's 4,000-mile sailing trip from sunny Tahiti to San Diego. Assigned to deliver the 44-foot yacht, Hazana, to California, Richard and Tami will soon find themselves ambushed by a devastating category-four hurricane--fighting for survival against towering waves, and 140-mile-per-hour winds. In the end--with Richard badly injured, and their vessel severely damaged, and adrift--Tami must find the courage, and the strength, to keep themselves alive even if all hope seems lost.—Nick Riganas The film begins with Tami awakening on the sailing yacht Hazaña after being unconscious for some time. After regaining her memory that Richard did not come below with her, she searches the crippled yacht in hopes of finding her fiance Richard and soon realizes he has been swept overboard after his safety harness broke during the hurricane. Tami screams in anguish and it is revealed that Tami is all alone, with no ships or land in sight. Back to 1983 (five months before the catastrophic hurricane), Tami arrives in Tahiti on board the schooner Sofia and meets Richard Sharp, a British sailor. Richard then invites Tami for dinner on board his boat, named Mayaluga. During a conversation, while having dinner together, Richard reveals that he experiences hallucinations while at sea. Back in real-time, Tami is stranded on board a crippled Hazaña and finds out that all the electronic devices are ruined by water damage, preventing her from making distress calls. Tami spots the lost dinghy with Richard clinging onto it and tries to sail the ship towards Richard but to no avail.

Tami then sees islands in a distance and uses her binoculars to see better. She sees a Japanese research vessel in a distance and fires two flares in its direction. The research vessel then alters its course and heads towards Tami, rescuing her. Tami returns to Tahiti after recovering from her head injury and visits Richard's boat (the Mayaluga) and bursts into tears after seeing the wall of photos of Richard and her. Tami then goes to the beach with a frangipani flower and places her engagement ring from Richard around the flower and lets it go in the water.It is then revealed in the credits that Richard Sharp was swept overboard and was never found, Tami Oldham was all alone aboard the Hazaña for 41 days and that she continues to sail to date."

After four years away from England, Robin becomes disillusioned with the Crusades when he fails to prevent his commander, Guy of Gisbourne, from executing prisoners, namely a teenage boy, despite the pleading of the boy's father, which prompts Gisbourne to send Robin back home. When he returns to Nottingham, Robin learns from his old friend Friar Tuck that the Sheriff had him officially declared dead two years prior in order to seize Robin's land and wealth to continue funding the war effort at the behest of the corrupt Cardinal, kicking the citizens from the city and into the coal mine town across the river. Investigating 'the Slags', Robin witnesses the commoners planning to rise against the government that oppresses and exploits them and learns that Marian is now involved with their aspiring leader, Will Tillman. Robin is prevented from making contact with her by the Arab whose son he tried to save. The man introduces himself as Yahya - which he says can be translated to ""John"" - and proposes that he and Robin work to end the war by stealing the money taken from the people to fund the church's war. Marian seeks Robin upon learning that he is alive, but he chooses not to tell her of his plans for her own protection.. Set in England in the Middle Ages, the film starts with a young thief named Marian (Eve Hewson) entering a stable to steal a horse.

He continues to rob them, earning himself the nickname ""The Hood."" At a meeting of lords, Robin suggests that a bounty be put out for the capture of this mysterious thief. The Sheriff and Friar Tuck then meet with the Archdeacon (Ian Peck), who informs the Sheriff that the Cardinal (F.

After the Archdeacon leaves, the Sheriff appears to plan something with Gisborne.The Sheriff arranges for a party to take place for the Cardinal's arrival. Robin, John, and now Marian attend, surrounded by all the other haughty rich folks. Tuck sneaks some keys off of a guard and gives them to Marian.

Super Troopers 2,2018,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0859635/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"When a border dispute arises between the U.S. and Canada, the Super Troopers are tasked with establishing a Highway Patrol station in the disputed area. Several years after the first film, the officers have been fired from the Spurbury Police Department after taking Fred Savage on a ride-along that resulted in his death. Farva (Heffernan) is now a construction supervisor, with Mac (Lemme) and Rabbit (Stolhanske) working for him. Thorny (Chandrasekhar) works in logging, and Foster (Soter) is living with his girlfriend and former coworker, Spurbury Police Chief Ursula Hanson (Coughlan). Mac receives a call from his former boss, Captain O'Hagen (Cox), to gather the group and meet for a fishing trip in Canada. Once the group arrives, they find that O'Hagen's intention had been for them to have a meeting with Vermont Governor Jessman (Carter). She explains that during a recent land survey, it was discovered that land in Canada was originally designated for the US. Canada has agreed to hand over the land, and Gov. Jessman needs to set up a police department to take over from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in the region. She invites the group to become state troopers again, with the promise that they will become full-time officers should they succeed at this task.. In this sequel, New York State Trooper Callaghan (Seann William Scott) is in his squad car chasing after a bus that has a strong weed stench coming from it. Callaghan stops the bus and boards it to find Thorny (Jay Chandrasekhar), Mac (Steve Lemme), Foster (Paul Soter), and Rabbit (Erik Stolhanske) playing in their band, Crackling Bacon, along with groupies. Callaghan gets excited as he is a fan of theirs, and he calls his partner Wagner (Damon Wayans, Jr.) to join them, since Wagner also loves the guys. The guys make them mess with each other, like making them punch each other in the nuts and almost make out before they offer them to join the band. The troopers get excited until Mac leads them out the back of the bus to push them out. The bus rides away and the troopers chase after them, shooting at them and hitting Mac. The others throw Mac's corpse out the bus and make the troopers crash their squad car. The bus then flies over a cliff.This turns out to have just been a dream of Rabbit's, which is apparently a frequent dream. The guys have lost their jobs as local police officers after an incident involving Fred Savage, so now they have to work in construction. They get a call from their former captain John O'Hagan (Brian Cox) to order the guys to head over to Canada for some important business.The guys drive to Quebec, Canada and reunite with O'Hagan and their least favorite co-worker Farva (Kevin Heffernan) to meet with Governor Jessman (Lynda Carter). She informs the guys that the Canadian town of St. Georges de Laurent is actually on American soil, so the U.S. government is attempting a turnover where the guys would become the new highway patrol officers instead of the Mounties. Jessman requests that the guys settle the dispute between the U.S. and Canada, allowing them to don their uniforms once more.The guys attend a rally with a bunch of angry Canadians led by Guy de Franc (Rob Lowe), a former hockey player who is now mayor of the town. Although the troopers try to keep things friendly, the Canadians pelt them with junk, getting Farva riled up and ready to start something. Meanwhile, the guys meet Genevieve (Emmanuelle Chriqui), who is working on the relations between the U.S. and Canada. Rabbit and Farva are both attracted to her, and Farva initiates a one-sided deal where the guy who fails to woo Genevieve has to chop off their pinky toe with a shovel.A few of the guys try to talk to Guy in his bar/brothel. When Guy and the others think they are about to be shut down, he makes the prostitutes (male and female) attack the guys. Outside, they also get into it with the local Mounties - Podien (Hayes MacArthur), Bellefuille (Tyler Labine), and Archambault (Will Sasso).The troopers try to put up a sign for the border when a trio of kids hopped up on drugs crash into the sign with a car. The guys make the kids lead them to where they found the drugs, and they come across a shack with a whole stash of drugs. They bring the stash back to the station and begin to take the drugs to see what they are dealing with. Farva takes something that makes him numb, Rabbit takes steroids, Foster takes speed, Thorny takes female hormones, and Mac takes acid.The troopers continue their investigation into the contraband items but also get further into their feud with the Canadians. The Mounties play a prank on the troopers by planting slabs of raw meat in their station to lure a grizzly bear in there. Thorny distracts the bear while Farva grabs the meat and runs outside. The bear chases him into a porta-potty and tips him over.The troopers fight back by taking tear gas grenades and setting them off in the Mounties' station. They take the Mounties, strip them naked, and pain them red, white, and blue, and leave them in the woods. The troopers then steal their uniforms and go screwing around town by messing with citizens to ruin the reputation of the Mounties. Guy and Genevieve find out when the Mounties return and make complaints, leading them to distrust the troopers in handling the turnover.During another instance of buffoonery, Farva crashes a car into a lamp post and knocks it over, only to find another stash of contraband drugs just around the border.Later, Genevieve approaches Rabbit at the station and apologizes for how she handled things with them. They start to make out and have sex on Farva's desk to spite him. The rest of the guys return to the station later to find it ransacked. After viewing the dashcam footage on Rabbit's car, they see him and Genevieve getting it on while some guys dressed as the Mounties knock them out and abduct them.The troopers go to a saw mill where they find the Mounties and accuse them of being the ones trying to smuggle contraband across the border. This turns out to be false, as the real criminal is Guy and his band of cronies, who figure they can get away with this if their town is on American soil already. They have also tied Rabbit and Genevieve to a log that is about to be sawed in half, only for Guy to reveal that Genevieve was in on the scheme as well. The troopers and Mounties set aside their differences to work together and fight Guy and his goons. After knocking out the villains, Genevieve reveals herself to be a triple agent, dropping her French accent and saying she was working undercover for the Ontario Police Precinct. They manage to stop the saw before it runs through Rabbit, but one of the blades hits the tip of his penis.Guy and his goons are arrested. Genevieve chews out the troopers for ruining her investigation, but she goes over to Rabbit and leaves an opening for them to continue their relationship once he's healed up.The troopers and Mounties gather for a small press conference where they appear to settle their differences and are prepared to accept that the troopers will replace the Mounties. Jessman then shows up to say that the turnover has been postponed by six months. The Mounties proceed to mock the troopers, leading to a fistfight between both groups.During the closing credits, we see the Fred Savage incident. The guys took him on a ride along as part of some training he did for a movie role. They see a cat stuck in a tree, and Fred climbs up to rescue the cat. He ends up falling out of the tree but lands on his feet and saves the cat. And then he gets plowed by a fire truck."
Holmes & Watson,2018,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1255919/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A humorous take on Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's classic mysteries featuring Sherlock Holmes and Doctor Watson. England, 1867A young Sherlock Holmes (Hector Bateman-Harden) is dropped off at a boarding school by his mother. Almost immediately, all the other kids start to pick on him and bully him. Sherlock keeps to himself until the kids appear to apologize and try to help him kiss a girl he likes. The kids blindfold Sherlock and make him kiss a donkey's behind. As the kids laugh at his humiliation, Sherlock decides from that day forward that he will close off all emotions and devote his life to solving crimes. He sucks a tear back into his eye and starts deducing other dirty deeds the kids were doing that can get them expelled, so they leave Sherlock alone for good. He then meets young John Watson (Codie-Lei Eastick), and the two become lifelong friends.In the present day around 25 years later, the adult Holmes (now played by Will Ferrell) and the adult Watson (now played by John C. Reilly) are preparing to head to the trial of Holmes's greatest nemesis, Professor James Moriarty (Ralph Fiennes). With only about 15 minutes left before the judge lets Moriarty free, Holmes and Watson are held back when their housekeeper Mrs. Hudson (Kelly Macdonald) brings them a package from Moriarty. They open it and find a supposedly deadly mosquito flying around the room. Holmes and Watson smack each other to kill the bug until Holmes deduces in his head that at the proper angle, he can squash the mosquito without damaging the glass case of bees it is perched on. Holmes splats it, but his theory is wrong, and the case breaks, releasing the swarm of bees upon the room.The judge is about to let Moriarty free until Holmes and Watson arrive in the nick of time. Holmes gives his testimony, concluding that the man standing trial is not guilty because it is not Moriarty. He is someone named Jacob Musgraves, set up to take the fall for Moriarty, and Holmes states that he could not have carried out any murders that Moriarty is guilty of because Musgraves has a tremble in his hand caused by too much wanking, and that the real Moriarty is heading to America. Inspector Lestrade (Rob Brydon) argues with Holmes that letting this man free will only lead to more murders, but Holmes brushes off Lestrade's warnings.Holmes and Watson are invited to Buckingham Palace by Queen Victoria (Pam Ferris). It turns out to be a surprise party for Holmes, though Watson makes it weird because he is infatuated with the queen. They bring out a giant cake shaped like a magnifying glass, only for Holmes and Watson to cut into it and find that there is a corpse inside, along with a note from Moriarty stating that he will kill the queen in two days time. Lestrade takes the time to chide Holmes for failing to stop Moriarty.Holmes and Watson go to the morgue for an autopsy on the corpse. They meet the American Dr. Grace Hart (Rebecca Hall), and her developmentally challenged companion Millie (Lauren Lapkus), with whom Holmes becomes enamored. Watson joins Grace for the autopsy, where he tells her that he wishes Holmes would view him as a co-detective. They start to clean the frosting off the corpse, which then turns weirdly sexual. After Lestrade arrives, Watson concludes that the cause of death is indeterminable.Back home, Holmes poisons Watson to prove his theory that the victim was poisoned. He figures that the poison must have come from a man named Gustav Cringer (Steve Coogan). They travel to a seedy part of London to get a lead. After one failed lead, they follow two tattooed men who got their ink done by Gustav. They head inside a building where they find Gustav, as well as Moriarty. Holmes and Watson are then forced to fight a brutish henchman of theirs, but Watson takes care of him with multiple bashes to the head with a chair. Before Gustav can give Holmes the information he desires, he is stabbed in the back by Moriarty. Holmes grabs the knife and throws it at Moriarty, who is then revealed to be Musgraves again.Queen Victoria visits Holmes and Watson to stress how urgent it is that they find the true killer. The two then try to get a ""self-photograph"" with the queen, but Watson accidentally knocks her out with the oversized camera and they think she's dead. They start to panic as the guards outside are banging on the door, but Victoria wakes up before the guards suspect foul play.Holmes and Watson go seeking help from Holmes's brother Mycroft (Hugh Laurie). The two try to communicate telepathically, which Watson tries to get in on, but he is sent to a room with other rejected companions, including the Elephant Man. Mycroft helps Holmes figure out that the killer is someone who is always near him and knows every facet of his life.Holmes gathers his closest associates together, along with Grace and Millie, to tell them all that he believes the killer to be Watson. Watson is then arrested and sentenced to hang for his crimes.Soon, Holmes realizes what a terrible mistake he's made, and he opens his emotions for the first time in years after he feels terrible for condemning his best friend. This leads to an over-the-top musical number in which Holmes and Watson sing their love for each other, and Holmes saying that he pushed Watson away because he thought he was losing him to Grace. Watson then has a visitor in his cell who brings him red velvet cake.Holmes gets help from the street children to help save Watson. He finds Watson's cell empty except for the plate with cake crumbs. Holmes figures that the killer is none other than Mrs. Hudson, as she makes that cake, and it's Watson's favorite, so he wouldn't leave crumbs unless it was to send Holmes a message. Sure enough, Mrs. Hudson has Watson prisoner and is forcing him to write a negative story on Holmes before carrying out her plan to kill the queen under orders from her father, Moriarty.The murder is set to take place on the Titanic, where the queen and other guests will be targeted. Mrs. Hudson waits outside on a boat with her henchmen. Holmes finds Watson tied to the gears inside a clock. He apologizes to his best friend, not realizing Watson is begging to be cut loose. The two then head to the main room where they find a rare drum that they figure must contain the bomb. Holmes tries to come up with a plan to stop the bomb, but he keeps getting distracted by thoughts of Millie. Watson then decides to charge through the room and rip through the drum and pull the bomb out. He throws it out the window where it lands in Mrs. Hudson's boat and blows her and her henchmen up.The queen commends Holmes for solving the case, but he gives credit this time to Watson for helping him. Watson and Grace kiss before parting ways, and Holmes talks to Millie, who speaks for the first time to tell him that she was playing stupid as an experiment on how easy it is to manipulate men. They share a kiss too before she and Grace board the Titanic on a ""safe"" voyage. Also Billy Zane shows up for a cameo.Holmes and Watson return home where Holmes shows Watson that he got a plaque in the front of the building to establish Watson as a co-detective. Watson is elated, even if the plaque is smaller than the large one Holmes has.In the final scene, the setting takes the viewers to desolate Wyoming, USA where the real Moriarty is hiding out in a bar. He then receives a message saying Holmes and Watson know where he is, and they are coming for him. Moriarty looks up to find the detectives smiling at him from the bar."

It seems to the Teens that all the major superheroes out there are starring in their own movies-everyone but the Teen Titans, that is.

The Hate U Give,2018,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5580266/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Starr witnesses the fatal shooting of her childhood best friend Khalil at the hands of a police officer. Now, facing pressure from all sides of the community, Starr must find her voice and stand up for what's right. Starr Carter is constantly switching between two worlds: the poor, mostly black, neighborhood where she lives and the rich, mostly white, prep school she attends. The uneasy balance between these worlds is shattered when Starr witnesses the fatal shooting of her childhood best friend Khalil at the hands of a police officer. Now, facing pressures from all sides of the community, Starr must find her voice and stand up for what's right.—Twentieth Century Fox Starr Carter is a 16-year-old black girl who lives in the fictional, mostly poor black neighborhood of Garden Heights, but attends an affluent, predominantly white private school, Williamson Prep. After a gun goes off at a party Starr is attending one weekend, Starr is driven home by her childhood best friend, Khalil. On the way home, they are stopped by a white police officer. The officer has Khalil, who is black, exit the car; while outside the car, Khalil reaches inside his car via the open driver-side window to check in on Starr, and picks up a brush. The officer, thinking Khalil picked up a gun, fires three shots into Khalil, killing him. Khalil's death becomes a major national news story. Starr's identity as the witness is initially kept secret from just about everyone outside Starr's family - leaving Starr's two best friends, Hailey Grant and Maya Yang, and Starr's white boyfriend, Chris, who all attend Williamson Prep together, all unaware of Starr's connection to the news story. Having to keep this secret weighs on Starr, as does her need to keep her Williamson and Garden Heights personas separate.. The film opens with the Carter family seated at the kitchen table. Patriarch Maverick (Russell Hornsby) gives his three children instructions on what to do in the event that he or they are ever pulled over by police, but to also not be ashamed of their identities as black children. Maverick then hands them Black Panther ten step programs.Present Day in the early 2010sStarr (Amandla Stenberg) is Maverick's daughter who lives with him, her mother Lisa (Regina Hall), her older half-brother Seven (Lamar Johnson) and younger brother Sekani (TJ Wright). Maverick was once part of the most violent gang in the neighborhood, the King Lords, but he has since left that life behind. The Carters live in the mostly poor, predominantly black neighborhood of Garden Heights. While gang violence is prevalent, there are places like Maverick's grocery store and other shops that thrive.Starr attends Williamson, a prep school in a rich, mostly white area. Starr feels that she can't be ""too ghetto"" with her Williamson friends, but not ""too preppy"" around her Garden Heights friends. She is dating Chris (KJ Apa), who just recently tried to have sex with Starr when she wasn't ready. He comes to her at school to apologize and show off his corny dance moves. Starr acknowledges that she and Chris get looks from the white girls who are too scared to say anything due to their interracial relationship.Starr attends a party in Garden Heights with Seven's sister Kenya (Dominique Fishback), whom Starr sometimes can't stand. Kenya notices a girl outside who's been talking trash about her, so she expects Starr to back her up in a fight, but Starr refuses to get involved. Starr strays from Kenya and meets up with her childhood best friend Khalil (Algee Smith). The two chat for a while until they witness an altercation between a group of guys, followed by the sounds of gunshots. Everybody runs out of the house, and Starr gets into Khalil's car.Khalil drives Starr home as the two listen to a Tupac song. Khalil points out a famous saying of the late rapper - ""The hate u give little infants fucks everybody"" (which becomes an acronym for THUG LIFE). The two pull over and start to reminisce about their childhood with another friend named Natasha who is no longer with them. They talk about playing with ""Harry Potter"" wands and how Khalil was Starr's first kiss. He kisses her in the car, but she tells him she has a boyfriend. Khalil pulls out to drive again. But a short while later, they are pulled over by the police. The cop, Officer Mackintosh, AKA 115 (Drew Starkey) (nicknamed due to his badge number) exits his squad car. He tells Khalil he pulled him over for failing to signal a lane change and asks for his license and registration, but Khalil argues over the matter even as Starr, who has her hands on the dashboard, tells him to comply. 115 orders Khalil to step out of the vehicle as he runs his license. Khalil looks into his car to see if Starr is okay, but she keeps telling him to do what the officer says. Then for some reason, Khalil reaches into his car to take out a hairbrush, and 115, mistaking it for a weapon, opens fire on Khalil. Starr runs out of the car to Khalil's side, but 115 cuffs her. He quickly realizes Khalil didn't have a weapon in his hand and he frantically calls for an ambulance. Starr weeps as Khalil slowly dies by her side.Starr is brought in for questioning by two detectives with her mother by her side. They ask questions regarding Khalil potentially carrying drugs and not about the incident in question. Starr's uncle Carlos (Common), another officer, comes in and takes her and Lisa out of the room. Starr is left traumatized and haunted by the incident even days later, and she cannot bring herself to tell anyone at school about it.Starr attends a wake at Khalil's home where she gives her condolences to his grandmother, Miss Rosalie (Rhonda Johnson Dents), who tells Starr that she was the only real friend Khalil ever had. She also confides to Starr that Khalil was selling drugs for King (Anthony Mackie), leader of the King Lords. After the wake, Maverick and Carlos argue over whether or not 115 will be investigated for killing Khalil.The Carters attend Khalil's funeral at a church. Seven's biological mother Iesha (Karan Kendrick) loudly orders him to join her, King, and his siblings in the back over the sound of the choir. Seven doesn't want to go, but Lisa tells him to just do it. A lawyer, April Ofrah (Issa Rae), goes up to give a speech on how what happened to Khalil has happened to too many young unarmed black teens that are being killed by the police all over the country at an alarming rate. She also implies that she knows that Starr was the witness to Khalil's shooting, even though that information had not been disclosed to the public.April visits the Carters that evening to offer Starr a chance to do an interview regarding the incident. She appears hesitant, and April says it's okay if she chooses not to. Before April leaves, Starr brings up what happened to Natasha. They were playing with Khalil as kids until a King Lord shot Natasha dead in the streets. Starr was afraid to snitch on him because she feared he or the other King Lords may retaliate. She later found out months afterwards that the shooter was killed in an unrelated rival gang hit, but she still didn't speak up, and she has felt guilty ever since. April tells her not to feel guilty and says that this is her chance to get justice for Khalil.Starr's parents take her to the interview where her face is blurred out and her voice is distorted. She tells the interviewer that Khalil was working for the King Lords, which King sees on TV.Later, as the Carters are having dinner, Starr and Maverick see King and his goons standing outside threateningly. Maverick goes outside to deal with King, who knows that Starr mentioned him in the interview. This leads to an altercation that is broken up just as the police arrive and two officers approach. Maverick calmly complies with the cops until one officer, a black man, presses Maverick against the window in front of his family. Lisa runs out to hand the cops his ID, but it gets more heated when the white cop presses Seven for his ID. Starr and another woman record the confrontation on their phone to show how the cops treat black folks, and the cops back off and leave the family alone. However, little Sekani is shaken up by it. When the family returns home, Starr tearfully apologizes for getting King to go after them. Maverick stands his kids outside the house and tells them to recite a step from the program he gave them earlier, which is to have something to live and die for, and for Maverick, that's his whole family.The stress from the incident puts more of a strain on Starr's life at school. The other kids use Khalil's death as an excuse to get out of class to make it look like they care and are trying to protest. Starr grows more distant from Chris, and things go sour with her friends Hailey (Sabrina Carpenter) and Maya (Megan Lawless) when they watch a news report on how 115 and his family have been getting death threats for shooting Khalil, and Hailey shows more empathy for 115 than for Khalil. When Starr talks to her mom about this, Lisa tells her that she has always been following Hailey's word without thinking for herself.On prom night, Starr attends with Chris, but all the other kids are looking at her weird. He takes her into his limo and says that he knows Starr was the witness to Khalil's death, and he is upset that she kept that from him. Starr feels that Chris doesn't grasp how the situation is for her as a black girl, and that he appears to ignore her identity as a black girl. Chris argues against that, saying that he sees her for who she really is.After they reconcile, Chris takes Starr and Seven home so that he can meet Maverick. The meeting turns out poorly, because although Lisa is happy to meet Chris, Maverick is none too pleased to see that Starr is dating a white boy. After Chris leaves, Maverick tells Starr he feels he has failed to show her what a black man should be, and Starr says that he showed her what a man should, period. As the family embraces, gunshots fly through the house, sent by King's goons. Maverick brings the family to Carlos's house to stay for safety, but he and Seven go back to stand guard at the house in case King comes back, despite Lisa's protests for neither of them to go back.Starr later goes before a grand jury to give her testimony against 115, and to tell everyone of the type of person that Khalil really was.At school, Hailey confronts Starr and asks her when she will get over Khalil's death. Starr has had enough, and she counters that Hailey is only ever friendly with her because she views Starr as a non-threatening black girl, which Hailey confirms. She also tells Starr that due to Khalil's history as a drug dealer, he would have probably gotten killed anyway, and that it made sense for the officer to mistake his hairbrush as a weapon. Starr then grabs Hailey's hairbrush from her backpack and starts yelling at her while holding the brush like a weapon, which drives Hailey to tears. Starr tells her that she now knows what it feels like for black folks.Chris drives Starr home, but they start to see a group of black folks protesting toward City Hall. Starr and Chris look at their phones and learn that 115 was not indicted for Khalil's death. Starr then gets a text from Kenya to go pick up Seven because King has beaten him up.Starr and Chris arrive at King's house where Kenya and her little sister Lyric are tending to Seven's wounds. Iesha callously tells the kids to beat it since King is coming back soon and she is just trying to drink. The kids head out the front door but see King arriving in his car. Iesha sends the kids out the back door for safety.The group arrives near City Hall where a massive crowd is growing for the protest. As they approach City Hall, the crowd is halted by a SWAT team. Starr tells Chris to get Kenya and Lyric out of there for safety. She then spots April, who hands her a megaphone so that Starr can be heard. Starr stands high up and announces to the crowd that she was the witness to Khalil's death, but so is everyone else in the crowd. While the people are moved, the police start firing tear gas grenades. Starr picks one up and hurls it back toward them. Starr and Seven run out but are blinded by the gas. Two friends of Maverick find the kids and put them in their pickup, along with two others. Starr tells them to go to her father's store to get milk to soothe the tear gas burns.The men bring Starr and Seven to Maverick's shop to pour milk over their faces. The men leave Starr and Seven, which King sees. As Starr listens to messages from her mother, King's goon lights the store on fire. Starr and Seven try to escape out the backdoor, but it's locked. Two other shop owners see the fire and try to help get the backdoor open. Maverick, Lisa, and Sekani arrive, and Maverick gets his kids out. King sees this and runs toward them. Maverick threatens to kill King and reaches into his back for the gun, only to find Sekani holding it and aiming it at King. That's when two white cops arrive and draw their guns on Sekani, to the horror of everyone else. Starr stands with her hands in the air to protect her little brother and yells to the cops asking how many more of them have to die for them to understand. Sekani drops the gun, and the police turn theirs away from him. King leaves the Carters alone.King is later arrested after multiple testimonies, and his rule over the neighborhood is now over. Starr and Chris are on better terms and are stronger than ever. She is no longer friends with Hailey, but she is still friends with Maya. Seven graduates from high school and is set to go to college the next year. Maverick's shop is in the process of being rebuilt, and he and Carlos get along better now.Starr goes to Khalil's home where Miss Rosalie tells Starr she can take whatever she wants from Khalil's room. She goes in and finds the ""Harry Potter"" wands that they used to play with. With her closing words, Starr vows to live up to her namesake and light up the darkness."

Searching,2018,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7668870/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"After his teenage daughter goes missing, a desperate father tries to find clues on her laptop. After David Kim (John Cho)'s 16-year-old daughter goes missing, a local investigation is opened and a detective is assigned to the case. But 37 hours later and without a single lead, David decides to search the one place no one has looked yet, where all secrets are kept today: his daughter's laptop. In a hyper-modern thriller told via the technology devices we use every day to communicate, David must trace his daughter's digital footprints before she disappears forever. Director Aneesh Chaganty's laptop thriller follows the the everyday life of the family through home videos and video chat footage. Their seemingly idyllic family life is usurped when Margot (Michelle La) disappears mysteriously. Her father David (John Cho) enlists the help of a dedicated detective (Debra Messing), and they venture down an unnerving internet rabbit hole in a desperate effort to find her. In San Jose, California, David Kim looks through old photographs and videos of his daughter Margot and his late wife Pamela, who died from lymphoma nearly two years earlier, after which David and Margot became distant. One night, Margot goes to a friend's house for her study-group. The next morning, David is unable to reach Margot but assumes she has risen early to go to school. Later, he calls Margot's piano instructor, but is informed that Margot had canceled her lessons six months ago. David discovers that Margot had been pocketing the money for the lessons, before suddenly transferring $2,500 to a deleted Venmo account. Realizing that Margot is missing, David calls the police, and the case is assigned to Detective Rosemary Vick, who asks for information about Margot's personality and friendships. David manages to access Margot's Facebook and speaks to her contacts only to discover that Margot has not had close friends since Pamela's death. Note: This entire film is shown through the point-of-view of laptop or phone screens.The film opens with a photo/video montage showing the life of a Korean-American family known as the Kims - David Kim (John Cho), his wife Pam (Sara Sohn), and their young daughter Margot. Margot took up an interest in piano lessons from a young age. Pam was later diagnosed with lymphoma that went into remission, but she later experienced a relapse. David and Margot stood by her side until she passed away in 2015.In the present, David chides Margot (now played by Michelle La as a teenager) for not taking out the trash. She says she will do it when she gets back from a study group session. David then talks to his brother Peter Kim (Joseph Lee), who is trying to make a gumbo recipe that Pam used to make. David sends him a picture of the recipe and then takes the time to watch a video of Pam showing a young Margot how to make the gumbo.That night, as David is sleeping, he misses two calls from Margot.David messages Margot again for not taking out the garbage. Hours later, he still hasn't heard from her. After work, he tries to contact Margot, but she never answers her phone. He thinks she might be at a piano lesson, so he calls the piano instructor, only to discover that Margot canceled her lessons six months earlier, which means that she has been taking the $100 bills that he has left her for herself. David starts to worry.David looks up the numbers of Margot's classmates from Pam's old contacts list. He calls the home of Margot's childhood friend Isaac (Connor McRaith), and he speaks to Isaac's mother, who tells David that Isaac and his friends went on a trip to the mountains, so she believes that Margot could be with them. David manages to get in touch with Isaac, who tells him that Margot is not with them and that he had invited her, but she declined.David calls the police and he speaks to the renowned Detective Rosemary Vick (Debra Messing), who is assigned to the case. She tells David to get in touch with anyone who may have been close to Margot or know where she was last seen. David goes through Margot's laptop and finds that all of her social media accounts are private. He logs into her Facebook profile using Pam's old email address, and he begins to reach out to Margot's classmates. Most of them have alibis from the night that Margot went missing, and others say that Margot was usually quiet and distant. David compiles a chart to keep track of who he has spoken to so that he can show Vick.Vick later shows David traffic cam footage showing Margot leaving a gas station and heading out of town. She also sends him a fake ID that Margot appears to have used under the name Jen Yeun. This, coupled with the fact that David found Margot's Venmo transactions having taken out $2,500, leads Vick to suggest that Margot ran away.Growing tired and increasingly afraid, David then comes across the site YouCast where Margot left live-streaming videos. He goes through the saved videos to see that Margot would talk to someone named Hannah, whose username was ""fish_n_chips"". Hannah also had a sick mom and would relate with Margot. David then notices one of the videos is of Margot at a lake, which matches a picture she posted to her Tumblr account. It's Lake Barbosa, where Margot liked to go to relax. David finds the directions from the spot where Margot was last seen, and he heads out.David calls Vick in the middle of the night once he gets to the lake. He finds a Pokeball key chain that belonged to Margot, confirming that Margot was there and that she didn't run away. In the morning, authorities fish Margot's car out of the lake. An envelope with $2500 is there, but Margot isn't in the front or the trunk. A bit of blood is spotted on the dashboard.News of Margot's disappearance spreads, leading to a search party scouring the woods for her. It becomes a trending topic, with some people sharing love and hope for Margot to return, while others mock the situation and accuse David of being involved in her disappearance. One of Margot's schoolmates, Derek Ellis (Reed Buck), who is (for lack of a better term) a douchebag, jokes that Margot is with him and that he's her pimp. David finds out he's at the nearby movie theater after checking in on Facebook, and he goes to confront him, leading to David kicking Derek's ass and breaking his jaw, which patrons record on their phones. Vick tells David to stay off the case because of this.David looks through the photos of the site of where Margot's car was found. Upon closer inspection, he notices a hockey hoodie in the front seat of the car that he recognizes as belonging to Peter. David looks through Margot's messages between her and Peter, which imply that they have been doing something that Peter knows David would kill him for.David pays Peter a visit and sets up cameras in his home to try and get a confession out of him. David asks Peter when he last saw Margot, and he appears to dodge the question. David then attacks Peter until he tells the truth, and Peter admits that he and Margot were smoking weed. She had caught him at one point and wanted to try it, so they kept it a secret from David. Peter points out that he was the only one who listened to her when she talked about her mother's passing, since David had avoided talking to her about it. David then gets a phone call from Vick, but he misses it and just hears her voicemail. Vick tells him that they got a suspect, and David breaks down crying as he listens to the voicemail.The news reports that an ex-convict, Randy Cartoff (Ric Sarabia), has apparently confessed to killing Margot before committing suicide. A video of his confession is shown, in which he tearfully apologizes for what he claims to have done to her. David is sent memorials and condolences for the news.David receives an email from a memorial service asking for videos and pictures of Margot that he would like to share for her upcoming memorial. After picking all the files that he wants so share, he notices a picture on the service's site that looks familiar. It appears to be Hannah, AKA fish_n_chips. He searches her image on Google and notices that the girl in the picture is some kind of catalog model. David calls the company that Hannah works for, and he speaks to her, but she has no idea who Margot is or what YouCast is.David tries to call Vick to investigate further since this doesn't add up for him. He instead speaks to a woman from the police station that tells him that Vick is not there, and she lets it slip that Vick volunteered for the case instead of being assigned as he had been led to believe. David does a little more investigating and sees an article of Vick with construction workers, and one of them is Randy. With this information, David brings a group of police officers to Margot's memorial, and Vick is arrested.A week after Vick's arrest, we see her being interrogated. She confesses that everything she did was because of a mistake that her son Robert (Steven Michael Eich) had made. It turns out that Robert had been in love with Margot for years, and he cat-fished her as fish_n_chips, using Hannah's picture as his own and coming up with this fake persona and backstory for months. Margot had taken out the $2,500 to help with what she believed was his sick mother's hospital bills. When Robert found her smoking weed at the lake, he frightened her and she ran. Robert went after her, and she started hitting him in self-defense, and he reacted by pushing her down the ravine. Robert called Vick panicked, and she told him not to do anything. She made up everything to throw David off, including making a fake ID for Margot, making it look like her body was nowhere to be found, and even setting Randy up to make a false confession and having him killed. Vick then points out that there is a possibility that Margot survived because there was a storm two days after she went missing, so she would not have been totally dehydrated. Robert is also taken into custody following this confession.A rescue team goes down to the ravine where Margot fell. From a live news chopper, we see the rescuers bringing up a body basket with Margot inside. David goes over to see if Margot is okay...It's now months later. We see a message exchange, followed by a picture of David with Margot in a wheelchair at the hospital, confirming that she is indeed alive. She is waiting and refreshing to find out if she got into a music conservatory that she had applied to. David messages her telling her that he is proud of her, and that her mom would be too."

On the Basis of Sex,2018,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4669788/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The true story ofRuth Bader Ginsburg, her struggles for equal rights, and the early cases of a historic career that lead to her nomination and confirmation as U.S. Supreme Court Associate Justice. Docudrama focusing on two periods of the young adult life of future US Supreme Court JusticeRuth Bader Ginsburg. The first time period is the late 1950s in her stint as a student at Harvard Law School, her class only the sixth after women were admitted to the school and including only nine females. DeanErwin Griswoldmakes known in veiled terms to those nine that he would prefer if it was still an all male institution. As such, Ruth knows that she has to work twice as hard as any male student to make herself known, which is made all the more difficult with unexpected issues at home with her fellow Harvard Law School student husband,Martin D. Ginsburg. The second time period is in the early 1970s. Despite wanting to get a job as a trial lawyer at a law firm, no such firm would hire her solely because she is a woman, and despite she finishing at the top of her class. Instead, she is teaching law at Rutgers specializing in sex discrimination in the law, this chosen specialization arguably as she has faced inherent sex discrimination in her chosen career and that she wants to inspire future generations of women to achieve what she has been unable to do herself because of that discrimination. Things change when Marty, now an esteemed tax lawyer, brings to her a case that he feels could change the face of her work, a tax case in which, solely because of the law, there is reverse discrimination, namely against a male, the two who decide to work on the case together, he from the tax side, she from the sex discrimination side. She is eventually able to convince her old friend Mel Wulf at the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) to provide the organization's official support. Ruth and Marty are told in no uncertain terms that in the strong possibility that they lose, the result could irrevocably set their careers back. Winning is made all the more difficult in they having to work within the structure that supports that sex discrimination as ""that's the way it's always been done"", and as Ruth has no trial experience, she who can come across as a bitter woman who the world has wronged.—Huggo In the year 1956, Ruth Bader Ginsburg (Felicity Jones) is one of six women in her class at Harvard Law School. Her husband Martin (Armie Hammer) helps her get ready for a dinner at the Dean's house welcoming the women to the class. When she arrives, Dean Griswold (Sam Waterston) callously makes each of the women stand up and explain why they're in law school. Ruth remains unfazed - she continues excelling in classes, and when men like Professor Brown (Stephen Root) won't call on her, she still manages to make her points.While playing charades at a social gathering with friends, Martin doubles over in pain. At the hospital, the doctor explains that he has testicular cancer and that the chances of survival are at six percent. Ruth assures Martin that he's going to live. She begins attending Martin's law school classes in addition to her own, typing both of their essays, and taking care of sick Martin and their young daughter Jane.Martin recovers fully from the cancer. He gets a job in New York, and Ruth meets with Dean Griswold to see if she can continue to earn her Harvard degree long-distance. Though he has made exceptions for men in the past, he coolly refuses, saying she has no special circumstance, and Ruth transfers to Columbia. Despite having graduated at the top of her class and being editor of the law review, no New York firms will hire her because she's a woman. She is frustrated and unable to use her law degree she worked so hard for. She is offered a Professorship, to teach law. Martin insists she decline, saying she will get a job and she shouldn't settle - she wanted to practice law. But Ruth decides for her family she will take the job.In 1970, Ruth is now a respected and successful professor. A lot of her students are young women who are involved in women's lib movement. She teaches her students about a case Dorothy Kenyon argued, where a jury of all men convicted a woman. Kenyon argued it was unconstitutional, that the woman should have a jury of peers - meaning women as well - and that it was gender discrimination. The court didn't believe gender discrimination was a real thing, and she lost. When she gets home, her now teenage daughter Jane (Cailee Spaeny) tells her mom she got an A on her 'To Kill a Mockingbird' essay, but Ruth admonishes her that Atticus Finch is not a good lawyer, since he helped cover up a murder at the end of the story. Frustrated at her mother being a stickler, Jane lashes out and runs to her room. Martin comforts Jane, explaining that Ruth is the way she is because her mother died when she was young and pushed Ruth to always be her best.Martin, a tax attorney, finds a tax case and brings it to Ruth. She says she's not interested, but he urges her to take a closer look: Charles Moritz filed for a caregiver tax deduction because he was caring for his ailing mother, but he was denied and prosecuted over it because that deduction is only available to women. Ruth realizes this is a case of gender discrimination where the victim is a man. She knows it could be massively important to helping repeal gender discrimination everywhere. She goes to meet old friend Mel Wulf (Justin Theroux), now the legal director of the ACLU (American Civil Liberties Union) and urges him to help her take on the Moritz case. He sympathizes but thinks it's unwinnable and is busy with many racial discrimination cases. Ruth is resolved to take it, however, and despite the fact that she's never practiced law, as a law professor she can legally take the case. Martin gets permission from his job to take a side project, and Ruth flies to Denver to meet with Moritz (Chris Mulkey). He is just trying to take care of his mother and doesn't think it's fair that the government is calling him a crook. Ruth agrees and promises to do everything she can.After another fight with Jane, who is into the women's lib movement and doesn't think her mother is doing enough, Ruth takes Jane to meet the famous Dorothy Kenyon (Kathy Bates). Ruth tells Dorothy about the case, and while Dorothy is interested and wishes Ruth well, she doesn't think the law will change until the culture changes. Despite that, Dorothy goes to Mel and argues him to take on Ruth's case.Mel tells Ruth the ACLU is going to back her case. He arranges a mock trial run in Ruth's apartment. During the questioning from the mock judges, Ruth, who has never been a practicing lawyer, struggles with the aggressive questioning - she's not a flashy speaker, she's quiet and measured. Mel tells Ruth that Martin is going to argue the case with her - he'll argue the tax law, and she'll argue the gender discrimination. Martin is reticent to take any of the cases from Ruth, but Mel says it is not a choice, the decision has been made.Meanwhile, Griswold has moved up at is now working at the state along with Brown. They will be opposing Ruth in the Moritz case. Griswold urges them that this case has the fate of the American nuclear family in its hands, and losing it would be a slippery slope to letting the traditional family fall apart.Before the Moritz case goes to trial, Wulf tells Ruth that the ACLU has taken another gender discrimination - Sally Reed, a woman who attempted to be the administrator of her dead son's estate but wasn't allowed because the law stated: ""males were preferred."" Wulf thinks they have a good shot at winning and wants Ruth to settle the Moritz case because if they lose it, it will set a precedent that will stop them from winning any cases. Ruth is angry, wanting to fight for what's right, but Wulf tells her the settlement arranges haven't been made. She tells Moritz, but he is disheartened when it's clear the state isn't going to clear his name and say he didn't do anything wrong. Ruth meets with Griswold and Brown, and turns down their one dollar settlement offer. She insists on a larger sum and that the state admit it was gender discrimination. They balk completely, and so the case heads to trial.At court, Ruth and Martin make their arguments, and the judges are pretty tough on them, barely believing that gender discrimination even exists. When opposing counsel gets up for their arguments, they go after Ruth and Martin personally, accusing them of trying to incite ""radical social change."" Ruth decides to handle the rebuttal - she tells the court that radical social change is already happening. She's seen how her daughter is living a different life than she could, and that the world is continually changing, and the law should allow for that. She asks them to right the wrong that is in the law.The Ginsbergs leave the trial, happy but awaiting the results. The final on-screen text tells us that Ruth won the Moritz and Reed cases, and started the women's branch of the ACLU. Martin continued to be a renowned tax attorney, and Ruth was eventually appointed to the supreme court by a vote of 97-3. In the movie's final shot, Felicity Jones as Ruth walks up the steps up the supreme court building, and it cuts to the real-life Ruth Bader Ginsberg walking up the very same steps."

White Boy Rick,2018,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4537896/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The story of teenager Richard Wershe Jr., who became an undercover informant for the FBI during the 1980s and was ultimately arrested for drug-trafficking and sentenced to life in prison. Set in 1980s Detroit at the height of the crack epidemic and the War on Drugs, WHITE BOY RICK is based on the moving story of a blue-collar father and his teenage son, Rick Wershe Jr., who became an undercover police informant and later a drug dealer, before he was abandoned by his handlers. Based on the moving, true story of a blue-collar father (McConaughey) and his teenage son, Rick Wershe Jr. (Merritt), who became an undercover police informant and later a drug dealer, before he was abandoned by his handlers and sentenced to life in prison. The following is based on a true story.The film opens to a gun show in Toledo, Ohio the year 1986. Rick Wershe Jr. (Richie Merritt) is a teenager examining some AK-47 automatic rifles for sale and negotiating a price with the dealer. He notices that the gun has details consistent with Egyptian-made AK-47s, unlike the Russian-made ones the dealer claims he's selling. He calls his father, Richard 'Rick' Wershe Sr. (Matthew McConaughey), over to confirm his suspicions and they blackmail the dealer into giving them a heavy discount in exchange for not ratting him out and costing him his license.The father and son then head home to Detroit, Michigan. Richard is talking about how they're both lions in a world of sheep. Richard is a small-time arms dealer who dreams of opening a video rental store one day. Rick is his 15-year-old son who seems to just go with the flow. When they return home, they see another car parked in their driveway. Both Richard and Rick recognize it as Ty's car. They get out of the car, and Richard pulls out one of the AK-47s and bursts in the house to his daughter, Dawn (Rick's older sister), making out with her boyfriend, Ty. Richard immediately guesses she's high and kicks Ty out of the house, with Dawn (Bel Powley) running out of the house to chase after him in her underwear. Their grandparents (who live right across the street) pull up just in time to see the whole event. Richard calms the situation down, and they go out for custard.Later that night, Richard is finishing up crafting silencers for the AK-47s and explaining to Rick about the concept of ""up-selling."" Rick uses this new knowledge to sell the AK-47s to some local gang members that he's familiar with. He makes a huge profit by up-selling them on the silencers and earns some respect from the gang's leader, Johnny Curry. Rick starts hanging with them and partying at a local roller skating rink that is frequented by the gang and corrupt cops.Early the next morning, Rick is woken up by Dawn, who tells him that she's leaving. Rick correctly guesses that she's going to live with Ty and tries to convince her to stay and leave Ty. Dawn leaves anyway and gives her a number to contact her, telling him not to give it to their Dad. However, Richard witnesses her leaving and stares out the window as she and Ty drive away. Later on, Richard is being hassled by the FBI, as his weapons are ending up in the hands of the gang members around town. FBI agents Alexandra (""Alex"") and Frank tell him they know about his illegally-made silencers and will catch him sooner or later. They ask Rick if he knows anything about the gang members, but Rick keeps quiet and only informs them that the gang members they pictured are dead.That afternoon, Rick is hanging out with the gang while they pick out tuxes for Curry's upcoming wedding to the mayor's niece, Cathy. Curry talks to Rick about respect and shows that he's earned his by telling Rick to try on a tux, subtly inviting him to his wedding. Rick attends the wedding and meets Art Derrick, a drug kingpin from Miami. On their way home from the wedding, Rick is riding with his friends from the gang, Nugg, Boo, Freaky Steve, and Ed when they happen on a few girls from their school. Rick calls out to one of them, Brenda Moore, who happens to be his crush from school, and asks them if they want to join them. The girls go with them to a drive-in movie theater, and Rick gets intimate with Brenda.A few days later, Rick is returning home from a night out and sees a stuffed duck on the side of the road. He takes it with him as a gift for his sister but is then approached by a vehicle, whose passengers reveal themselves to be the FBI agents from before along with a narcotics police officer. They tell him that the silenced AK-47s he sold to the gang were used to commit a murder and they can use that to arrest his father unless Rick cooperates by making drug purchases so they can gather evidence against the gang. Rick, being backed into a corner, agrees to cooperate. He picks up some crack cocaine from a local dealer and delivers it back to the agents. After several times, the agents then hand him a brick of cocaine and tell him to sell it in order to better blend in with the gang crowd (people in Detroit who only buy and don't appear to be undercover cops). They tell him he can keep whatever money he makes, and Rick sells the cocaine and pockets $4,000.Later on, Curry confronts Rick with the knowledge that he's been selling cocaine to his customers. He warns Rick to be more transparent with him and allows him to sell with his other dealers, provided he gets his customary cut. After a few months, Rick is living the good life with the gang, even traveling to Vegas for a boxing title fight. Curry had been promised by one his customers, Leon, that he had set him and his crew up in Vegas with ringside seats and would have his money by the time they got back. When they showed up to the fight, they were denied, as Leon had given the tickets to another gang leader. After the fight, everyone went to an after-party, and the other gang leader flaunted in front of Curry, who responded by beating him to death with a champagne bottle.When Rick and the gang returned from Vegas, Curry sent two of his men to kill Leon at his house. However, Leon left shortly before they arrived and when the two gang members opened fire on the house from outside, a bullet hit one of Leon's young sons, killing him. This made big news, and now police were rounding up anyone who possessed AK-47s. The gang and even Richard were all getting rid of the ones they had. Curry gathered his gang together, including Rick, and let them know that they had to be extremely careful now and that he would do whatever it took to stay out of prison. When Rick returned home, Richard was just leaving and told him that he had been given a goldfish as a gift from one of his customers. An hour later, Rick was looking at the fish when his friend and fellow gang members, Nugg, came to the house. Rick got him a soda, but when he turned around Nugg shot him in the stomach and fled. Rick was saved through a long surgery and was able to recover fully, albeit slowly. In the hospital, Rick was listed under a fake name for his protection, and the FBI agents let him know that because of his help, they were able to take down Curry and most of his crew.Later, Rick and Richard were driving home and began talking again about opening a video store. Rick expressed his doubts that they would ever do anything with their lives and Richard almost crashed the car while arguing back. Luckily, they were both uninjured, and Rick pleaded with his Dad to let him become a cocaine dealer again so that they could finally have a good life. Richard was initially against it, but eventually relented and Rick began to sell cocaine on the streets, making a steady stream of big money.A short time later, Rick and Richard approached a house filled with drug users and found Dawn asleep in one of the rooms. Rick told her they were taking her home and she kicked and screamed the whole way. They locked her in her room back home while she detoxed from the drugs she was on. While difficult in the beginning, she eventually made a full recovery after several days. After months of selling cocaine, Rick had earned more than enough money to make his Dad's dream come true, and Richard was able to open up a video store.The next morning, Rick answers a knock at the door to find a little kid who tells him that his sister, Brenda, just had a baby and that it's Rick's. Rick and Richard travel to Brenda's house to meet Rick's daughter, Keisha, and they take turns holding her. A few days later, Rick talks with Curry's wife, Cathy, at the roller rink and they eventually go back to her place. Cathy tells Rick that if Curry had been smart and only trusted the people she put him in contact with, he wouldn't have gone to prison and left her alone. She and Rick then have sex.During the next year, FBI agents storm Rick's house and arrest Rick and Richard. Rick is held on drug possession with intent distribute, and since he had more than eight grams, it would be for a life-sentence in prison. They later speak with Alex and Frank, who tell them that the FBI will publicly deny any relationship with Rick, but will try to get his sentence reduced if he cooperates on one of last informant task. Rick has Cathy help him out with a large shipment of cocaine and the FBI raid the deal and arrest everyone involved. Unfortunately, they announce Rick's name on television as having been the instigator of the bust, putting him in danger. At his court hearing, the jury concludes that Rick is guilty and the judge gives him the full life-sentence in prison. Richard confronts Alex and Frank, and they tell him that they never made any promises for Rick and that it's over.A year goes by, and Dawn and Richard visit Rick in prison along with Rick's daughter Keisha. Rick tells Dawn to keep showing Keisha his picture every night. Richard then talks to him about his case and lets him know the mandatory life-sentence for drug offenses might be overturned soon. Rick laments that his life over now that he's in prison and Richard tears up and apologizes for not being able to give him an easy life like he wanted to. Rick is then led back to his cell and Richard, Dawn, and Keisha leave to go home.The credits reveal that Rick stayed in prison for over 30 years, holding the record for the longest prison term for a non-violent offender in the state of Michigan. He was finally released on parole in 2017. His father, Richard, passed away in 2014. His daughter, Keisha, is now happily married with two sons. A voice recording of the real Rick Wershe Jr. plays in the background, with him stating that nobody thought he should really be in prison, but that he was feeling happy and hopeful."

With D-Day approaching, Boyce and the others begin to realize there is more going on in this Nazi-occupied village than a simple military operation.—Chockys On the eve of D-Day, a paratrooper squad is sent to destroy a German radio tower in an old church; however, their plane is shot down before they can reach their target, leaving only five apparent survivors, Corporal Ford and soldiers Boyce, Tibbet, Chase, and Dawson. Dawson is killed by a landmine but the team continues onward, running into a French woman named Chloe who agrees to take them into the village where the radio tower is located. The soldiers learn that Chloe lives with her 8-year-old brother Paul and her aunt, who has been disfigured by Nazi experiments taking place in the church. After Tibbet and Chase depart to check the scheduled rendezvous site, the remaining soldiers are forced to hide in the attic when a Nazi patrol performs a routine inspection. But when SS Hauptsturmführer Wafner attempts to rape Chloe, Boyce attacks him, forcing the soldiers to take him prisoner.. France, June 1944. On the eve of D-Day, a squad of American paratroopers sets foot on the beaches of Normandy to destroy a German radio-jamming tower, only to fall behind enemy lines. As the surviving soldiers close in on their crucial target, soon, they realise that there's more to the Nazi-occupied village than meets the eye. Now, a sinister, blood-curdling secret hidden in an underground laboratory threatens to change the outcome of WWII. Are the unsuspecting intruders prepared to confront the horrific, unstoppable new menace?—Nick Riganas 1944A team of paratroopers led by Sergeant Eldson (Bokeen Woodbine) are heading into Germany with orders to take down a Nazi radio tower from a church. Just as they near their target, their plane is shot at by enemy soldiers. The surviving men jump from their plane before it explodes, and they land in the water before swimming to land.Private Ed Boyce (Jovan Adepo) reunites with Corporal Ford (Wyatt Russell). Boyce spots Eldson being found by a group of Nazi soldiers and sees as they execute him. Ford keeps Boyce quiet as they move and find Tibbet (John Magaro), Chase (Iain De Caestecker), and Dawson (Jacob Anderson). They walk toward their mark, and Dawson accidentally steps on a land mine that blows him up. The others keep moving into the woods as they spot a French woman named Chloe (Mathilde Ollivier) walking by. Ford orders them to run after her since nobody can know they are there. The men catch up to her, and Boyce speaks to her in French to let her know they mean no harm. Chloe reluctantly lets the men follow her back to her home.Chloe leads the soldiers into her village when a neighbor hears her and calls to the German soldiers for her being out past her curfew. Chloe talks to the Germans while the American soldiers stay hidden. She brings them back to her house where she lives with her kid brother Paul (Gianny Taufer) and Aunt Simone (Eva Magyar), who is terribly ill and is heard making an unpleasant and loud wheezing sound. The men hide up in the attic. Paul wants to play catch with Tibbet, but he coldly brushes him off before he and Chase go check out the rendezvous site. Outside, German soldiers take a man and woman outside and execute them. Chloe says this is what happened to her own parents.Chloe tends to Boyce's bullet wound as she explains what happened to her family. Boyce also plays with Paul a little bit. Moments later, more German soldiers arrive for an inspection. They are led by Captain Wafner (Pilou Absaek). Boyce has to hide again as Chloe lets him enter her home. Wafner attempts to rape Chloe, but Boyce comes out and attacks Wafner, and the soldiers keep him tied up in the attic.Ford sends Boyce out to find the rendezvous point. He comes across the church where the tower is located, but he is nearly spotted and is forced to hide in a truck filled with corpses of the other paratroopers. Boyce finds himself inside the church, and he comes across a laboratory where he sees a number of horrific discoveries, such as the head of a woman separated from her body but still speaking to him, as well as a bag with a barely living thing inside. Boyce hides and sees the mastermind, Dr. Schmidt (Erich Redman), entering. Boyce finds a fellow paratrooper named Rosenfeld (Dominic Applewhite) and pulls a massive needle out of him to save him. Boyce also takes with him a needle containing some kind of experimental serum before he and Rosenfeld flee.Boyce brings Rosenfeld back to the attic and shows Ford the serum. He questions Wafner as to what it does, but he refuses to say anything, so Ford starts beating the crap out of him. Boyce explains to Ford what he saw in the church, so Ford starts to devise a proper plan to make their way in and take the tower down.Ford orders Chase to go upstairs to untie Wafner so that he can get them inside. Wafner then attacks Chase and grabs his gun, shooting him repeatedly. Everyone runs upstairs to subdue Wafner, but while they try to help Chase, he ends up dying. Boyce grabs the needle and injects Chase with the serum. He soon comes back to life, but very quickly, he displays signs of enhanced strength and disorientation. Chase then starts to mutate horrifically and become violent. He attacks his comrades, forcing Ford to shoot him repeatedly. This doesn't kill Chase, so Boyce has to smash his head to bits in order to kill him for good. Wafner says that is what the serum does and is essentially being developed by the Nazis to reign supreme for a thousand years. Wafner then manages to escape as his comrades are outside, and he kidnaps Paul and gives him to the soldiers. Ford and his men fire at the Germans, and Wafner gets half his face shot off as he gets out. Ford then decides they have to take down the tower immediately, with Paul's rescue being second priority. Boyce and Chloe don't like this, so they plan to rescue Paul first.Wafner returns to the lab and finds Schmidt. To Schmidt's horror, Wafner takes two needles with serum and injects himself, causing a rapid mutation and making him grow increasingly mad.The Americans use a German soldier that they strapped with explosives to make their way into the church. Tibbet and Rosenfeld stay outside killing soldiers while Boyce, Ford, and Chloe head inside. Chloe is almost attacked by a soldier who tries to get her killed by one of the mutated people. The mutant kills the soldier and goes after Chloe, but she burns him to death with a flamethrower. She manages to get Paul out, but they still come under fire by the Germans.Tibbet manages to get Paul through the gunfire, but is wounded himself. Meanwhile, Boyce and Ford encounter Schmidt and the mutated Wafner, who attacks them. Boyce fights Schmidt as he tries to stab him, but Boyce manages to kill Schmidt. Wafner then gets Ford and impales him on a meat hook. Boyce distracts Wafner as Ford frees himself and injects himself with the serum to fight Wafner. Before Wafner can get Ford, Boyce throws a tank and shoots it, causing an explosion. Boyce tries to help Ford out, but he chooses to stay behind and ensure that the laboratory is destroyed along with the tower. Ford gets an explosive ready as Wafner prepares to attack. Boyce runs out as Ford detonates the explosive, killing himself, Wafner, and every last mutant in there as the whole place goes down. Boyce reunites with the others outside and confirms that Ford is gone, while Chloe tends to Tibbet's bullet wound.In London some time later, Boyce reports to his superiors on the mission, stating that Ford chose to detonate explosives from inside the tower to ensure that it went down. He also chooses not to mention a thing about the lab or the experiments. The superior then tells Boyce that he and his men will be reassigned."

A murder mystery set in a world where humans and puppets co-exist, but puppets are viewed as second-class citizens. When the puppet cast of an '90s children's TV show begins to get murdered one by one, a former cop, who has since become a private eye, takes on the case.—Anonymous No Sesame. All Street. THE HAPPYTIME MURDERS is a filthy comedy set in the seedy underbelly of Los Angeles where puppets and humans coexist. Two clashing detectives with a shared secret, one human (Melissa McCarthy) and one puppet, are forced to work together again to solve the brutal murders of the former cast of a beloved classic puppet television show.—STXfilms In a sunny Los Angeles where puppets are second-class citizens to humans, Phil Phillips--once the LAPD's first puppet police officer, and now, a weary private investigator--finds himself dragged into a world of mystery and murder, as an unknown sadistic killer is targeting the members of a popular 1980s sitcom. To have a chance at solving this baffling case, Phil must bury the hatchet and team up with his former human partner, Detective Connie Edwards; nevertheless, more innocent actors meet their end. Can the mismatched duo find the answer before it's too late?—Nick Riganas In a world where puppets coexist with humans but are treated as second-class citizens, Phil Phillips was the first puppet cop on the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) before being fired. Now a private detective with a human secretary Bubbles, he is hired by puppet client Sandra to find out who has been blackmailing her. Phil investigates a lead at a puppet-owned porn shop and while he goes in the back to check their records an attacker kills everyone present, including Bumblypants, a cast member of ""The Happytime Gang"", a puppet sitcom that was due to go into syndication. The LAPD arrive and Phil meets up with his former partner, Detective Connie Edwards. Twelve years prior, Edwards was being held at gunpoint by a puppet criminal. Phil tried to shoot him but missed and hit an innocent puppet, killing him in front of the puppet's young daughter. Edwards and the thug exchanged fire; Edwards was wounded but the thug was killed. Edwards received a puppet liver transplant which left her with an addiction to sugar which is like heroin to puppets. Edwards testified against Phil and a law was enacted preventing puppets from being cops. Back in the present, Edwards believes it was a robbery gone wrong but Phil believes it was murder. That night Phil's brother Larry ""Shenanigans"" Phillips, former Happytime cast-member, is torn apart when someone lets dogs into his house. Phil reluctantly teams up with Edwards to find the killer.. Set in an alternate reality of Los Angeles, where humans co-exist with puppets, who are treated as a marginalized group. Phil Phillips (Bill Barretta) is a former cop who is now a private investigator. He goes to his office where his secretary Bubbles (Maya Rudolph) tells him he has a visitor. A female puppet named Sandra White (voice of Dorien Davies) has come to ask Phil for help regarding someone who may be threatening her and has sent her a note. He notices that one of the letters cut to make the message looks familiar, so he decides to get on the case.Phil goes to a puppet porn shop to find a weird sex scene being filmed involving an octopus milking a cow. He asks the shop owner about the magazine they sell there, which has a font style matching the letters on the note. As Phil goes in the back to check the records, he runs into a familiar puppet named Mr. Bumblypants (voice of Kevin Clash), who is trying to hide his porn addiction. When Phil is gone, a tall hooded person walks into the shop with a shotgun. He aims at Bumblypants until the owner pulls out his own gun in defense, but the gunman shoots the owner before blowing the heads off the octopus and cow, and then proceeds to kill Bumblypants.The authorities arrive on the scene after Phil discovers the dead puppets. He is dismayed to find his former partner, Detective Connie Edwards (Melissa McCarthy), is there, as the two had a falling out after Phil was kicked off the force. Edwards thinks it was a robbery gone wrong, but Phil notes that it was just murder because the assailant didn't take anything.Phil later has lunch with his brother Larry (Victor Yerrid), a former actor who starred in the children's program ""The Happytime Gang"", along with Mr. Bumblypants. Since the show ended, Larry has tried to look less like a puppet by getting a nose job and bleaching his skin. A fan approaches Larry and asks him to say his famous catchphrase (""You're under arrest for being too hot to handle!""), which bugs Phil.Later that night, Larry is in a hot tub with a human woman while watching the show. She leaves to make drinks, and the killer from before sneaks behind the house and sets three dogs loose to grab Larry and tear him to pieces. Police arrive in the morning to the crime scene where Phil makes the horrifying discovery. After Edwards arrives, he tells Lt. Banning (Leslie David Baker) that he thinks Larry's death is connected with the porn shop murders because he feels Bumblypants was the intended victim, so the killer may be targeting members of ""The Happytime Gang"".Phil and Edwards reluctantly team up to investigate. They suspect that because the cast of ""Happytime Gang"" was expected to cement a new deal in which they would split a large amount of money between each other, someone may have wanted to kill them off to get the money to themselves. Phil and Edwards visit Ronovan Scargle (Michael McDonald), one of the show's producers. Phil knocks him out and takes a file on his desk to look over.The detectives are led to a seedy part of the city where puppets are addicted to sugar and some of them are prostituting. They find Lyle (also Kevin Clash), another former cast member who is now a drug lord. Since it's a strictly puppets only joint, Phil tells Lyle that Edwards can get in because she has a puppet liver. To test this, Lyle makes Edwards snort rock candy through a twizzler. Phil talks to Lyle outside while Edwards plays poker with the other puppet gangsters. One of them makes a sexist remark toward Edwards, as well as mistreating one of the female puppets in there, so Edwards kicks the stuffing out of the gangsters and makes them apologize. Outside, Lyle is shot to death by the killer, and Phil fails to catch him.Phil later returns to his office to find Sandra in there again. She tells Phil that the person harassing her has sent her another note, along with a picture of Sandra with Jenny (Elizabeth Banks), the only human member of ""The Happytime Gang"" and former girlfriend of Phil. The killer threatens to expose something involving Jenny and Sandra. After asking for Phil's help, Sandra seduces him and they have sex in his office as Banning arrives with FBI Agent Campbell (Joel McHale).

He doesn't give Edwards any leads, but she steals some of the sugar he's snorting, unable to hide her own addiction to the stuff. Goofer is later found dead under a pier after supposedly overdosing and falling over into the ocean.Phil goes to find Jenny at a freaky puppet strip club where she works. She claims to not know Sandra, but she regrets that it didn't work out between her and Phil. He walks her outside to her car before they part ways, but the car explodes and apparently kills her. The police arrive and see Phil, believing him to be responsible for Jenny's death.Phil goes to Edwards' apartment, where she is passed out from having too much sugar. He has a flashback to the incident that drove a wedge between them - Edwards was being held at gunpoint by a large puppet thug, and Phil tried to take the shot, but he missed and hit a male puppet, killing him in front of his young daughter. The thug shot Edwards, but she killed him before he got away. The wound to her liver was so severe that Phil had to take her to a puppet hospital to get a puppet liver. Edwards later testified against Phil, and he was thrown off the force. After she wakes up, Phil asks for her help.The two head to find the two remaining Happytime Gang members, Ezra and Cara, also known as the Kissing Cousins. Phil and Edwards head to their house and find their creepy deformed children before coming across Ezra and Cara's mangled bodies on the bed. The killer gets away, and Campbell shows up with other agents to arrest Phil and Edwards.Campbell later interrogates Sandra, who lies and says that Phil killed Jenny, her wife, and was trying to keep Sandra for himself. She uncrosses her legs, and Edwards sees that Sandra has purple pubic hair. Banning takes Edwards off the case, and she proceeds to curse out all the other cops in the room for being incompetent.Bubbles finds Edwards in her apartment to ask for her help in proving Phil's innocence. She has Sandra's home address, and they break into her place to find any info they can. They come across a room with pictures and notes planning the deaths of the Happytime Gang, as well as a whole conspiracy against Phil. Edwards then notices a picture of Jasper Jacoby, the man who Phil accidentally shot, along with his daughter who has purple hair. Edwards then realizes what's going on - Sandra was Jasper's daughter, and she has been planning revenge against Phil for her father's death. Bubbles sees a tape recorder and presses the play button, which ignites a fire that destroys all the evidence against Sandra. Edwards goes to tell Phil what she's learned, and they head to stop Sandra.Phil and Edwards make it to the airport where Sandra is planning to depart. Phil runs up to her and tries to apologize for killing her father, saying it has haunted him all those years, but he asks why the Happytime Gang had to die because of it. Sandra says she wanted Phil to suffer as payback. It also turns out Jenny is alive and in on the scheme with Sandra, but she instead knocks Jenny out to take the money for herself and get away. Edwards runs after Sandra and tries to get in her plane, but Sandra gets the drop on her first and holds her at gunpoint. She steps outside with Edwards, putting her and Phil in the same position as before. Phil takes his shot and doesn't miss this time, hitting Sandra in the head and killing her. Edwards congratulates him for not missing.Banning arrives to congratulate Phil and Edwards on cracking the case. He reinstates both of them to their old jobs. Phil also asks Bubbles out on a date, and she accepts Campbell shows up to personally show appreciation to Phil, though Phil can't resist continuing to make fun of him with Edwards' help."

The hotel was once very popular but is now deserted, staffed by a single desk clerk. Some of the new guests' reasons for being there are less than innocent and some and are not who they appear to be.—grantss 1969. The gaudily decorated El Royale Motor Hotel, literally straddling the California/Nevada border located just outside of Tahoe, has seen better days, but almost simultaneously four individuals check-in - they the only four guests - all assisted by the only hotel employee working this day, the young clerk, Miles Miller. The four are: southern traveling salesman Laramie Seymour Sullivan, stereotypically brash as to his profession; aging Catholic priest Father Daniel Flynn who is showing early signs of Alzheimer's; struggling black singer Darlene Sweet, who has a gig in nearby Reno; and an angry young female hippie who refuses to divulge her name. Some of the four are not who they appear on the surface, those individuals having a very specific reason for choosing the El Royale beyond just needing a place to stay. The true stories of the four plus that of Miles become intertwined, with what happening affected by the dirty secrets of the El Royale. What happens between the five may also be affected by others who are looking for one or more of the five, either in helping them or reclaiming them for their own nefarious purposes.—Huggo In 1969, Catholic priest Daniel Flynn (Jeff Bridges) (a robber masquerading as a priest), singer Darlene Sweet (Cynthia Erivo), salesman Laramie Seymour Sullivan (Jon Hamm) (Dwight Broadbeck / Seymour 'Laramie' Sullivan, an undercover FBI agent posing as a home supplies salesman), and sarcastic Emily Summerspring (Dakota Johnson) arrive at the El Royale, where they meet the hotel's only employee, Miles Miller (Lewis Pullman) (who served as a sniper in the Vietnam War).Upon checking into the honeymoon suite, Sullivan (in reality an FBI agent named Dwight Broadbeck, sent to remove illegal FBI surveillance equipment in one of the rooms) discovers a passageway leading into a corridor looking onto one-way mirrors in each of the hotel's rooms, as well as a 16mm camera setup.

Director Chris Weitz's historical thriller is based on the story of how a group of Israeli secret agents arrested notorious SS officer Adolf Eichmann - the man who masterminded the ""Final Solution"" - in Argentina. Oscar Isaac plays the legendary Mossad agent Peter Malkin, while Ben Kingsley plays his emotionally manipulative arch-nemesis. After tracking Eichmann down to Buenos Aires, Malkin and his men captured him and brought him to Israel for a historic 8-month trial.

In Buenos Aires, Sylvia Hermann (Haley Lu Richardson) begins courting Klaus Eichmann (Joe Alwyn). Klaus meets Sylvia and her German-Jewish father, Lothar (Peter Strauss) at home. Klaus speaks of his father's service with the SS but tells Lothar that he had died on the Eastern Front, and that he has been raised by his uncle, Ricardo. Suspicious, Lothar passes this information to West German prosecutor-general Fritz Bauer. Bauer, suspecting Klaus' uncle may in fact be Adolf Eichmann, relays this intelligence to Mossad director Isser Harel (Lior Raz) in Tel Aviv, but Harel is unwilling to devote resources to investigate. At the insistence of Rafi Eitan (Nick Kroll), Harel dispatches field agent Zvi Aharoni (Michael Aronov) to Buenos Aries to begin reconnaissance. At a dinner party celebrating Argentina's 150th anniversary of independence from Spain, Klaus introduces Sylvia to Carlos Fuldner, a former Nazi officer who assisted with SS members escape to Argentina.

Field agent Zvi Aharoni (Michael Aronov) is dispatched in Buenos Aires to begin reconnaissance, presumably being offered the job over Peter.Klaus takes Sylvia to a meeting, which turns out to be a Nazi revival led by Carlos Fuldner, which Eichmann also attends. Realizing what the meeting is, Sylvia abruptly leaves, ending her relationship with Klaus.Now working in coordination with Mossad, Sylvia meets the Eichmann family at their home under the guise of reconciling with Klaus. An argument between her and Klaus causes Adolf (living under the name Ricardo Clement and claiming to be Klaus's uncle) to intervene; Klaus accidentally refers to him as his father and Eichmann is subsequently photographed. Eichmann notices the operative taking his photo and sketches him.The Mossad team uses the evidence from the meeting to confirm Adolf's identity and plan his capture - they intend to disguise themselves as an air crew and fly him out while sedated. Peter and his ex-girlfriend Hanna, a doctor, are brought on to the team with her role to keep Eichmann sedated during their travels. After capturing Eichmann, he admits his real identity, but his family realize that Sylvia found out as well, and inform the police who prevent their plane from taking off. The agents learn that the Israeli airline, El Al, will not agree to transport Eichmann unless he signs an affidavit stating he will willfully go to Israel; he refuses to sign because he does not believe he will get a fair trial. The team's interrogator is not able to get through to Eichmann, but Peter eventually does by sharing his personal story of the loss of his sister and her three young children to the Holocaust and listening to Eichmann's story about being ignorant of the actual killing of the Jews, his job being focused exclusively on logistics.During the plane's delay and while they await Eichmann's capitulation, Klaus and the police increasingly investigate Eichmann's disappearance, distributing the sketch of the operative to the public. As the Mossad team prepare to leave, Eichmann drops his polite facade and tells Peter a horrific story of watching 5,000 Jews murdered in a pit, cruelly wondering aloud if one of them (a woman who had begged Eichmann to save her infant) was Peter's sister.When one of the Mossad team is captured after using US dollars instead of pesos, she reveals the location of the safe house, and the rest of the team must escape in one car, leaving two operatives behind. The police also confiscate the plane's landing permits, grounding it. Peter hand-delivers a copy of the permit to air traffic control and, seeing the police closing in, orders the plane to take off without him.Later, all the operatives reunite at Eichmann's trial.

Together, they struggle against a determined emperor and the frailties of the human spirit to live out the Gospel and spread the message to the world. Roma, 67 AD. After the great fire that burnt a great part of the city, Emperor Nero points Paul, Jesus' apostle, as guilty of the fire, arresting him and taking him to Mamertine Prison. There prefect Mauritius struggles between his daughter Caelia, who suffers an unknown disease, and his job as warden of the prison commanded by own Nero, that he is considers as a failure on his military carrier. Despite the risks for the Christians, physician and medicine man Luke arrives Roma from Greek Islands to find Paul, living in the house of Aquila and Priscilla, two former Romans turned in Christians that they use their home as shelter for others Roman Christians to save them from Nero's soldiers, who kill all Christians they find, torturing and using them as human candles to light Roma's streets at night. After realizing that Paul is in Mamertine, Luke get access to the jail and he meets Paul, who accepts Luke's request to tell his biography to be known before he is executed by Nero, writing it in a new book about Gospel and Jesus' teachings. Meanwhile Luke writes detailing the beginnings of ""The Way"" and the birth of what will come to be known as the church, a bound on chains Paul fights the inner demons of his remembers as survivor of much-floggings, shipwreck, starvation, stoning, hunger and thirst, cold and exposure-yet, waiting for his appointment with death and haunted by the shadows of his violent past, wondering if he has been forgotten and if he has the strength to finish well. Mauritius, discovering Luke's intrusion, tries use it to earn Nero's favor in the belief that Paul will confess to be who burnt Roma. Intriguished by Luke, Mauritius permits more meetings between Luke and Paul to disgust of Mauritius' wife Irenica, who lives in eternal suffering by Caelia's ill. Due to the increase of violence by a young Christians looking for vengeance, Priscilla and Aquila doubt to leave Roma with the people saved or stay to save more Romans, at the same time that Luke's life and his efforts for the book endangers by Mauritius' ambitions. With time running out, Luke faces his destiny, that not only will changes everything around him, too around the world.—Chockys Paul is imprisoned and Christians in Rome are facing heavy persecution. With darkness seeming to close in, Luke meets with Paul to receive encouragement and guidance for God's people, inspired to write down Paul's story into what would become known as the book of Acts.—jcase1981 Luke the evangelist enters Rome in secret just as he witnesses Christian victims being set ablaze as human torches to light the night-time streets. He has been sent by other Christian communities outside of Rome to meet with Paul the Apostle and persuade him to help in writing an account of his wisdom. Luke meets with Priscilla and Aquila, the leaders of the Christian community hiding out in the city, who are currently debating whether to stay in Rome and continue to provide hope to persecuted victims of Nero's pogrom or to leave Rome with their community to avoid certain death.Paul has been imprisoned inside Mamertine Prison for his strong influence as a Christian leader which makes him a threat to Nero's power and the Roman Empire. Mauritius Gallus, the newly appointed prefect of the prison, accuses him of burning half of Rome down and, under Nero's decree, sentences him to death. Luke uses forged papers to sneak into the prison and joyfully greets a weary, physically beaten Paul. Paul and Luke both agree that Paul's time is soon coming to an end and so Luke convinces Paul to help him write an account of how Paul, formerly known as Saul of Tarsus, came to be one of Christianity's greatest leaders. Mauritius discovers that Luke manged to sneak into the prison with the help of high-ranking Romans, but allows him to visit Paul unscathed because those Romans are also friends of Mauritius.Paul begins narrating his origins: That he was once Saul of Tarsus, a Jewish boy, who was influenced by the zealotry of the Jewish leaders and witnessed the martyrdom of Stephen at their hands for professing his faith in Jesus Christ. This event made Saul vow to destroy all Christians throughout the world. Mauritius laments the fact that he has been made prefect of the prison despite his many deeds for Rome and that his daughter is dying from a terrible sickness despite all his sacrifices to the Roman gods. At a tavern, his friends suggest that he find some evidence that the Christians were responsible for burning down Rome despite rumors abounding that it was Nero who started the fire.The Christian community continues to suffer losses, including a Roman boy named Tarquin who was sent to enlist the aid of Roman citizens sympathetic to the Christians' plight. Tarquin's cousin, Cassius, adamantly calls for Christians to take up arms and seek revenge against the Romans for all their persecutions. But, Aquila rebukes him by saying that Paul never sought revenge or wished ill upon all those who harmed him and that ""love is the only way"". Luke, having witnessed the Roman's barbarism and cruelty, relates this news to Paul and begins to sympathize with the need for revenge. Paul, however, admonishes him for ""giving up on the world when Christ did not"" and tells him that the very love which Christ died for is the only way to counter this evil. Inspired by these words, Luke lets go of his anger and continues writing down Paul's story.At this point, Paul relates his story about how he hunted down and butchered many Christians throughout the Holy Land until the day he rode for Damascus with his brethren. He became blinded by God and heard His voice asking why Saul persecuted Him. This event along with Saul's meeting Ananias, a disciple of Christ, humbles Saul so deeply that he repents of his actions. Ananias restores Saul's sight and baptizes him in the name of the Lord, which leads to Saul rejecting his former name and becoming Paul.Mauritius, having heard about Paul's reputation as a preacher and miracle worker, speaks with Paul and relays his concerns that his daughter is dying. Paul suggests that Luke be allowed to examine her and help, but Mauritius refuses to allow a Christian into his home despite the protests of his wife who is growing impatient with Mauritius' hubris. Further, Mauritius has Luke imprisoned under the assumption that Paul and Luke are plotting an escape from the prison to lead an uprising against Rome. Paul, however, assures him that this is not the case and offers Luke words of comfort that he will find the strength to love and forgive their enemies.Cassius, having lost all patience with Priscilla and Aquila's pacifism, decides to take matters into his own by bringing an armed group of men to storm the prison and free Paul. But, Paul rejects their offer of rescue by telling them that Christ has already won the victory upon the cross. Dejected, Cassius and the others escape before more guards arrive and disappear into the night. Mauritius angrily accuses Paul and Luke of the conspiracy to escape despite their protests and has Luke thrown into prison along with other imprisoned Christians. After learning that they will be sentenced to Nero's circus to be devoured by wild beasts, Luke leads the other Christians in prayer asking the Lord to forgive their captors for their impending execution.Mauritius finally relents after fearing the loss of her daughter and has Luke brought to his house to help save her. Luke sends Mauritius to Aquila and Priscilla for supplies needed to heal the child. Mauritius, amazed that Luke would entrust the lives of other Christians to him, goes alone to their hiding place and begs for their help. Although initially wary and distrustful of a Roman asking for their assistance, they relent and give Mauritius the supplies he requests. With the items delivered, Luke is able to use his healing skills as a physician to cure the warden's daughter of her illness at the same time that the imprisoned Christians are thrown into the circus.With his daughter finally healthy again, Mauritius graciously spares Luke's life and thanks Paul for continuing to show him compassion and kindness. Although Mauritius is sorry for the deaths of the Christians in the arena, Paul responds by saying that Mauritius may yet come to know Jesus Christ and God's undying love. Paul and Luke meet one more time and express their hope that all the world shall know the Christians by their love and that they will meet again. Aquila and Priscilla, having decided at this point to leave Rome with their community, agree to deliver Luke's completed letters and writings to Timothy, thus ensuring that the Acts of the Apostles will be told and retold to all Christians and non-Christians.Luke decides to remain in Rome and continue the work of evangelizing in the name of Christians. As the Christian community escapes into the countryside, Paul is escorted outside the prison to be executed by decapitation with Luke watching. Mauritius shakes Paul's hand in a final gesture of goodwill and respect. As Paul's execution is underway, a voice-over narrates his conclusion to Timothy saying that he is thankful to have fought the good fight, finished the race, and kept the faith. The final scene depicts Paul arriving in Heaven as a crowd of people greet him joyfully, including all those he once persecuted and killed. He is last seen walking towards Jesus filled with peace."

Sorry to Bother You,2018,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5688932/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"In an alternate present-day version of Oakland, telemarketer Cassius Green discovers a magical key to professional success, propelling him into a universe of greed. In an alternate version of Oakland, Cassius Green gets a telemarketing job and finds the commission paid job a dispiriting struggle as a black man selling to predominately white people over the phone. That changes when a veteran advises him to use his ""white voice,"" and the attitude behind it to make himself more appealing to customers. With a bizarrely high-pitched accent, Cassius becomes a success even as his colleagues form a union to improve their miserable jobs. Regardless, Cassius finds himself promoted a ""Power Caller"" selling the most morally abhorrent but lucrative products and services as his connection to his girlfriend and colleagues fades away. However, Cassius' conscience arises anew as he finds himself in the midst of his boss' bizarre world of condescending bigoted decadence and his sinister plans to create the perfect subservient work force with Cassius' help.—Kenneth Chisholm (kchishol@rogers.com) In Oakland, the company WorryFree advertises free food and lodging at the cost of a lifetime work contract, a practice deemed legal and not equivalent to slavery. A radical group called ""The Left Eye"" opposes WorryFree by holding protests and vandalizing their ads.
Cassius ""Cash"" Green (Lakeith Stanfield) lives in his uncle's garage with his girlfriend, Detroit (Tessa Thompson), an artist and Left Eye member. Struggling to pay rent, Cash gets a job as a telemarketer for RegalView. Cash has trouble talking to customers until an older co-worker, Langston (Danny Glover), teaches Cash to use his ""white voice"". Cash uses the voice to excel at work, and his manager says Cash is close to becoming one of RegalView's elusive ""Power Callers"".At the same time, RegalView co-worker Squeeze (Steven Yeun) decides to form a telemarketer's union and recruits Cash, Detroit, and their friend Sal (Jermaine Fowler). When Cash participates in a protest at work, he expects to be fired but is instead promoted (as he has qualified to be a power caller). Now in the luxurious Power Caller suite, Cash is told to always use his white voice and learns that RegalView secretly sells arms and human labor from WorryFree.
Cash is uncomfortable with the job until he is shown his new salary. As a Power Caller, Cash is able to afford a new car and apartment and pays off his uncle's (Terry Crews) home. Working long hours, he stops participating in the union, and his relationship with Detroit deteriorates. Cash even ends up crossing the union's picket line, and one of the picketers hits Cash with a can of soda (yelling ""have a cola and smile, woman!""). The video quickly becomes an internet meme.
Continuing to close sales as a Power Caller, Cash is invited to a party with Steve Lift (Armie Hammer), CEO of WorryFree. Lift is seemingly fascinated with Cash and invites him to a one-on-one meeting. There, Lift offers Cash a powdered substance which Cash inhales. Looking for the bathroom, Cash instead discovers a shackled half-horse, half-human hybrid who begs him for help.Cash drops his phone in fear and runs into Lift, who explains that WorryFree is planning to make their workers stronger and more obedient by transforming them into ""Equisapiens"". The transformation takes place when a human snorts a gene-modifying powder similar to cocaine. Cash immediately assumes he just snorted the substance, but Lift assures him he would not do so without Cash's consent.
Lift explains he wants Cash to become an Equisapien and act as a false revolutionary figure among them to keep them in line with WorryFree's goals, offering Cash $100 million for five years. When the five years are up, Lift says he will be able to take a ""defusing powder"" and return to his normal self.
Cash leaves in a panic, still worried he was tricked into snorting the powder. He visits Detroit, who tells him she got a video message from Cash's missing phone. It turns out to be a cry for help from the Equisapiens. To make the video viral, Cash goes on a reality show called I Got the Shit Kicked Out of Me! (using his newfound status as a meme), enduring a variety of physical punishments in order to get the video played.The plan backfires; Lift's plot is hailed as a ground-breaking scientific advancement, and WorryFree's stock reaches an all-time high. A regretful Cash apologizes to Squeeze, Sal, and Detroit. The union decides to make one last stand against RegalView, now joined by Cash.
The next day, Cash uses a security code from the Equisapiens video to break into Lift's home. He goes to the picket line, where the police show up and start a riot. Cash is knocked out by an officer. Later that night, he wakes up in a police wagon and witnesses the Equisapiens fighting the police, easily overpowering them with their superior strength. The Equisapiens save Cash, thanking him for his help earlier, and run off to keep fighting.
Detroit and Cash reconcile and everything seemingly returns to normal-until Cash starts to grow horse nostrils. In a mid-credit scene, a fully transformed Cash leads a mob of Equisapiens to Lift's house. Cash calls over the intercom and remarks ""sorry to bother you"" before leading the mob to break down the door."

Rivals in power and in love, and female rulers in a masculine world, the two must decide how to play the game of marriage versus independence. Determined to rule as much more than a figurehead, Mary asserts her claim to succeed to the English throne, threatening Elizabeth's sovereignty. Betrayal, rebellion, and conspiracies within each court imperil both thrones--and change the course of history.—Focus Features Queen of France at 16 and widowed at 18, Mary Stuart defies pressure to remarry. Instead, she returns to her native Scotland to reclaim her rightful throne. However, Scotland and England fall under the rule of the compelling Elizabeth I. Each young Queen beholds her sister in fear and fascination. Rivals in power and in love, and female regents in a masculine world, the two must decide how to play the game of marriage versus independence. In 1561, Mary (Saoirse Ronan), Queen of Scotland and former Queen Consort of France, returns from France to her half-brother the Earl of Moray's (James McArdle) home in Scotland after her husband's death. In England, her cousin, Elizabeth (Margot Robbie) is the Queen of England - she is unmarried and has no child, and is threatened by Mary's claim to the English throne. John Knox (David Tennant), a Protestant cleric on Mary's council, is incensed about a Catholic being in charge of the country and is abusive to Mary.Elizabeth wants to control Mary and weaken her claim to the throne and thinks the best way to do this would be to marry her to an English subject. She is herself in love with Robert Dudley (Joe Alwyn) but decides to offer him to Mary. He protests, only wanting to be with her, but Elizabeth sends him anyway. However, once she meets with Dudley, Mary refuses to marry him, since he is a commoner and not royal - unless she is named as the next in line to the English throne. Elizabeth balks but is stricken with smallpox. Hearing of her impending death, Mary agrees to marry Dudley - once she is named the successor. Elizabeth, not genuinely wanting to let Dudley go, sends Lord Darnley (Jack Lowden) to Scotland. He claims to only be there for religious freedom, but Mary knows this is not true. He is charming, however, and their bond grows until eventually, he proposes.Because Darnley has royal blood, he actually strengthens Mary's claim to the throne, and Elizabeth's advisers tell her to put a stop to the marriage and press the marriage of Dudley to Mary. Mary's council itself is also suspicious of Darnley's motives, assuming that he wants to take over their country on behalf of England. The English ambassador comes to Scotland and demands that Darnley return to England, but Mary refuses, since she's doing as asked and marrying an Englishman. This enrages Moray, who doesn't want to go to war over his sister's passion. He leaves the Queen's council.England supports Moray in a rebellion against Mary. Mary and Darnley marry, but the next morning Mary finds him in bed with her male friend David Rizzio (Ismael Cruz Cordova). She is upset but has a rebellion by some Scottish nobles to deal with. Rizzio goes to Mary, sorry and begging for forgiveness - Mary does indeed forgive him, saying they both fell for Darnley's charms and that they must be careful. Mary's forces are able to quash the rebellion, and she spares Moray's life. She then forces Darnley to have sex with her so that she can conceive an heir. When she announces her pregnancy, she declares the child the ""heir to Scotland and England,"" which naturally greatly offends the English.Moray meets with Darnley's father Matthew (Brendan Coyle) to hatch a plan to undermine Mary. A rumor starts that Rizzio is actually the father of Mary's child and that she is an adulterer, which gives Knox fuel to preach to the Scottish that Mary is an evil woman. The under-miners meet with Darnley, telling him he needs to sign the bond for their plan to remove Rizzio. He refuses, but his father warns him that in the public perception either he is the adulterer or Mary is, and this way no one needs to know of his homosexuality. He reluctantly signs. Mary, her handmaids, and Rizzio are playing games upstairs when the plotters burst in to execute Rizzio. Mary physically stands in the way but is unable to stop them as they stab Rizzio over and over, to her horror. The nobles insist that Darnley deliver the killer blow.The nobles bring Moray back into the fold, and they demand pardons for all the rebels. Mary wants to know if Darnley knew of the plot and they tell her he signed a bond. She agrees to the pardon if they can prove Darnley knew, and they agree. She makes peace with Moray. She writes to Elizabeth, asking her to be the godmother. They strike a deal: if Elizabeth has children, they will be heirs to the throne, but if not, it will be Mary's child - much to the chagrin of Elizabeth's council. Mary confronts Darnley with his signature on the bond and banishes him from her sight. He is angry, wanting to be with his child, but she tells him he is lucky to keep his life. Mary's council begs her to divorce him, claiming that he still plots to take the throne, but she refuses to be a queen who keeps getting married over and over. The council approaches Bothwell (Martin Compston) an advisor and protector of Mary's, and they all arrange to have Darnley killed.In the ensuing melee after Darnley's death, Mary is forced to leave her child with her maids and flee. The very next day, Bothwell tells her that the council says she needs to marry a Scotsman as soon as possible and they have decided on him. Mary doesn't want to, but faced with seemingly no choice, she goes through with it. This gives Knox more fuel to preach that Mary is a harlot and that she had Darnley killed herself. Moray and other advisers tell Mary she must abdicate and that the country does not trust her. Bothwell is furious, but Mary tells him he's a fool - this was their plan all along to remove her. Moray begs her to abdicate so they can be a family. Mary says he's holding her son hostage, and that they are no longer family. She refuses to abdicate.Elizabeth is sad to hear of what has been happening, and the two cousins arrange a clandestine meeting. Elizabeth tells Mary no one can know of the meeting. Mary asks for help getting her throne back, but Elizabeth tells her she cannot go to war on a Catholic's behalf. Mary offers to make obeisance to Elizabeth but Elizabeth sadly still refuses, but says that she is safe in England. Elizabeth tells Mary as long as she does not aid England's enemies, she will be unharmed. Mary says if she does so, it will only be because Elizabeth pushed her there, and if she murders Mary, she murders her own sister queen. Elizabeth orders Mary to be imprisoned in England.Some years later, Elizabeth receives evidence that indicates Mary conspired with her enemies to kill her. She doesn't know if it is true but has no choice but to act, and orders Mary's execution. Elizabeth cries for Mary. Mary is taken to her execution and reveals a scarlet dress, the colour of martyrdom. In her last thoughts, she wishes her son James well and hopes for peace upon his reign.The postscript tells us that upon Elizabeth's death in 1603, James became the first monarch to rule both England and Scotland."

The old-style flip phone is being held together with duct tape. When he hands the phone back to Liam, he says there must be some very important messages on there for Liam to want it fixed so badly. Liam says, ""just one."" Left alone in the office, Liam accesses the saved message - from Josie.When Liam returns to the hotel, Sam is waiting - furious that Liam took off and videos of him running down the street in his bare feet are being played all over the TV and internet. Liam lies down on the couch and tells Sam to get him an espresso. Then he notices a news story on the TV. Mason, his groomsman from the opening scene, has been killed in a car accident. Liam just stares at the TV in disbelief.Later, Sam is trying to get Liam to the airport so they can get to the final concert of the tour. While alone in the car, Liam tells the driver he'll pay him $1,000 to get him out of there. They peel out of the parking garage.In the next scene, Liam gets out of the car in front of the St. Augustine church, telling the driver that he better leave and not to tell anyone where he is if he wants to keep his job. Liam walks to the door of the church but doesn't go in. He sits on the steps and listens as the preacher talks about what a good man Mason was. His head is down, and he turns away from the door, bumping into Josie and a young girl who are rushing into the service. Josie and Liam lock eyes, but then she grabs the girl, and they go inside the church. She sits next to her brother and tells him that Liam is there. Her brother is obviously not happy about it.Later, Liam watches the cemetery burial from a distance. When the graveside service is over, Jose tells her brother to take her daughter so she can go to Liam. He doesn't want her to, but she does anyway. She walks up to Liam and punches him hard in the stomach, walking away without saying a word. Doubled over on the ground, Liam looks up and sees the preacher. ""Hi Dad,"" he says.Liam stays at his dad's house, but there is palpable tension between them. His dad is bitter that Liam has not been home in 8 years and hasn't had any contact since becoming famous. Liam wants to know if there's a car he can use while he's there and his dad tells him that his bike is still in the garage. His dad leaves for work, telling him that he'll make dinner if Liam sticks around that long.Liam calls Sam and, asks him for credit cards and if he can buy a car. At first, Sam is really upset because Liam missed the concert and no one knows where he is. His publicist is sending out press releases making up stories to explain his absence. Liam tells him that his friend was killed and he's in his hometown. Sam softens and tells him he will take care of everything.Liam gets his bicycle out and heads into town to buy alcohol. The clerk at the store mentions that she went to high school with him and appears disgusted that he doesn't remember her. He takes the bottle and the bike and sits down on a bench. Just then, he notices Josie going into a flower store across the street, so he follows her.Josie is not pleased to see Liam, and he tries to be apologetic, and they exchange awkward small talk. She tells him that the flower shop is hers, that she bought it a few years back, saying that she's done pretty well for herself on her own. The door opens and a woman with a couple of kids, including Josie's daughter, come in. Josie tries to get them out of the store, but Liam starts talking to the girl. She tells him that she's seven and her name is Billie (same name as Liam's mom). She also says that she knows who he is - he's the country singer from the radio that her mom listens to sometimes. Josie asks her friend to take the kids for ice cream so she can talk to Liam. She confesses that she found out she was pregnant two weeks after he left her at the altar. She tried to contact him, but he never called back, and she promised herself that if he didn't call back, she would never try to contact him again.Liam goes back to his dad's house, where his dad is making dinner. Liam is angry, yelling at his dad for not telling him he has a daughter. Dad gets angry back and says ""I did tell you!"" Liam asks him what he's talking about, and Mr. Page tells Liam how he tried to call many times, but Liam wouldn't answer, so then he flew to Seattle to see him in person at a concert. He convinced security to let him backstage, but Liam was so strung out he told his dad to leave and never come back. He had decided then that Josie & Billie would be better off without him in their life. Liam doesn't remember any of it and seems embarrassed by his behavior.The next day, Liam returns to the flower shop and asks Josie if he can get to know Billie. He assures her that it will be on her terms, but that he deserves the chance to get to know his daughter. She reluctantly agrees.Later, Josie and Billie are sharing waffles, and Josie says she wants to talk to her about her father. Billie says ""he seemed nice."" Josie is shocked that Billie picked up on the fact that Liam is her father. Billie says they were too obvious, and he seemed very surprised to find out about her. She then suggests to Josie that they invite him for dinner.Liam wants to buy something for Billie but is so used to other people doing everything for him, he has to call Sam to find out how to order something online. He tells Sam that he has a daughter and he's nervous and scared. Sam tells him he's going to be great.At dinner, Josie's brother is also there and is still being stand-offish with Liam. Next to Billie is a huge teddy bear, twice as big as she is. Liam is awkward, but Billie puts him at ease and then tells her mom to open her present. Josie opens the box, and it's a beautiful necklace. Billie asks Liam if he wants to see her room and meet her pet rabbit. In her room, they talk, and she says she's afraid to take the rabbit out of the cage because it might scratch or bite her. Liam asks if he can, and they sit on the floor with the rabbit. Billie tells Liam that he should pick her up from school the next day so they can get to know each other.After dinner as Liam gets ready to leave, Josie gives the necklace back and says she can't accept it. She also tells him that Billie doesn't want things from him, she just needs to know him. Liam tells her that Billie asked him to pick her up at school. A little unsure, she finally agrees and tells him to meet her at 3 pm.Sam has a convertible Mustang delivered, so Liam has a car, so the next day he goes to meet Josie and Billie at the school. He and Josie talk about how they went to the same school, and Liam teases Josie that he doesn't know what a car seat is when she gives it to him. Just then, Mason's widow calls Josie, and she's not doing well, so Josie leaves to help her out. Liam greets Billie when she gets out of school, but Billie refuses to get in the car - reciting the low survival rates of crashes in convertibles. Liam finally calls his dad to pick them up.Back at his dad's house, Liam, and Billie bond some more while his dad makes dinner. Billie brings out Liam's first guitar, given to him by his mom, and together they start to improvise a melody. When his dad burns himself in the kitchen, Liam jumps up to help. Billie picks up the guitar and starts to play, to the men's amazement. Liam asks how long she's played guitar and she answers that it's the first time; she just watched what he did. He tells her that he's going to take her guitar shopping.Things are going well, and Liam is enjoying the time he's spending with Josie and Billie. One night Josie even lets Billie stay the night with Liam. As Liam is tucking her in, Billie asks him why he left her mom. After a short hesitation, he says that he was confused and young and dumb. He knows it was wrong, but he was lost and didn't know how to handle fame. Josie and Liam's dad listen from the porch and the other room as Liam and Billie talk. They are both moved by Liam's honesty. Billie tells Liam he's back home now.After Billie goes to sleep, Liam & Josie talk on the porch. When Josie stands up to leave, she realizes she's a little tipsy and asks Liam to drive her home. When they get to her house, she tells Liam that she wants something from him: to go on a date with The Liam Page - the famous country singer. He asks her if she is ready for that and she says yes, so he agrees.We see Josie getting dressed in a very fancy dress, Billie helping her with her lipstick. A stretch limo pulls up to take Josie to Liam. The driver tells her that Mr. Page wants it to be a surprise. He takes her to a field where Liam is waiting with a helicopter. They fly to New Orleans and are mobbed by press and fans. One reporter asks Liam who the beautiful woman is and he replies ""She's the one."" They have a romantic night and kiss on the dance floor.One afternoon they are having a get together with friends, and Liam & Billie are pretending to be lions, tearing into the ""bloody meat"" (hot dogs with ketchup). Josie's brother arrives and realizes that Billie is choking. He rushes over to help while Liam stands back, frozen. As Jake tries to perform the Heimlich on Billie, with Josie frantically telling Billie to hang on, Liam is still frozen. He is remembering walking into the hospital as nurses try to revive his mother. They try to get him to leave the room, but he stands there, in shock, as he realizes his mother is dying. Jake is finally able to get the food out of Billie's throat, and she's fine, but Jake is mad at Liam for not doing anything.Next, we see Liam getting drunk in a bar, upset that he stood by while Billie almost died. Jake comes in and says he figured that's where he'd find Liam. He tells Liam that he's not fooled by him the way everyone else is and that Josie & Billie would both be better off without him.The next morning, Liam's father wakes up, and there is a note on the coffee machine that says ""they're better off without me. Say goodbye for me"". Then we see shots of Josie in tears and a sad Billie being held by Jake.Cut to Liam on stage in Berlin, singing a melancholy song. After the concert, Liam, Sam, and the band are getting on their private plane to head to the next concert. Sam gives Liam an earful about leaving Josie and his daughter. Liam realizes he has to go back and he starts telling the steward to let him off the plane. His publicist is freaking out, saying NO! But Liam gets off the plane and runs to get a plane ticket to Louisiana. As he's waiting in the airport, he listens to the saved phone message, and for the first time, we hear the whole message. It's Josie, asking him to call her back because it's really important. She says that she won't try again, but not matter what he decides to do, she will love him forever. Liam calls Josie and gets her voice mail. He leaves a message saying that it's taken him eight years to return that message. He said he has listened to the message every day for eight years. He tells her that he's coming back and that he'll never leave Saint again unless it's with her and Billie.Liam arrives back in Saint and goes to Josie's house. No one is home, and he leaves, leaving his phone on the front porch.In the morning, he is woken up by someone throwing rocks at the window. It's Josie, and she gestures for him to come outside. She has his phone in her hand and asks if he really listened to her message every day for eight years? He says yes, he did. She asks if he really won't leave again unless she and Billie are with him? He says that's right. ""Then, Liam Page, welcome home"" and she kisses him passionately.The movie ends with Liam and Billie on stage, performing a song together. Josie, Sam, Liam's dad, Jake, and the publicist are all watching."
Mortal Engines,2018,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1571234/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"In a post-apocalyptic world where cities ride on wheels and consume each other to survive, two people meet in London and try to stop a conspiracy. A mysterious young woman, Hester Shaw, emerges as the only one who can stop a giant, predator city on wheels devouring everything in its path. Feral, and fiercely driven by the memory of her mother, Hester joins forces with Tom Natsworthy, an outcast from London, along with Anna Fang, a dangerous outlaw with a bounty on her head. Thousands of years after civilization was destroyed by a cataclysmic event, humankind has adapted and a new way of living has evolved. Gigantic moving cities now roam the Earth, ruthlessly preying upon smaller traction towns. Tom Natsworthy (Robert Sheehan)-who hails from a Lower Tier of the great traction city of London-finds himself fighting for his own survival after he encounters the dangerous fugitive Hester Shaw (Hera Hilmar). Two opposites, whose paths should never have crossed, forge an unlikely alliance that is destined to change the course of the future.—Ajaysinh Jadeja Based on the Bestselling book by Philip Reeve, Mortal Engines tells the story of a dystopian future, where cities move on wheels across a barren earth. One day on London, a young, scarred girl named Hester Shaw meets with a boy named Tom Natsworthy, an outcast from London, and accompanied by the brave Anti-Traction League, must stop the villainous Valentine and an unfolding plot to destroy the world. The film starts with the voice of Shrike (Stephen Lang) briefly recapping a devastating event known as the 60 Minute War, in which the Ancient Ones laid waste to the world around them, and those that remained went on to form mobile predator cities that lord over the smaller cities.A 28-year-old young woman named Hester Shaw (Hera Hilmar) lives in a Bavarian mining town on wheels called Salzhaken. The much larger predator city of London goes after the smaller town via the Hunting Grounds as the wealthy and well-kept citizens of London cheer like it's a sport. The other people in the small town panic while Hester runs to the front, waiting to be absorbed by London, as she has her eyes set on London's Head of the Guild of Historians, Thaddeus Valentine (Hugo Weaving). Within a matter of moments, Salzhaken is brought inside London.A young Apprentice Historian named Tom Natsworthy (Robert Sheehan) meets with Valentine's daughter Katherine (Leila George) as they check out London's little museum of ""old tech"" (smartphones, toasters, computers, etc) where Tom is sent by his boss, Chudleigh Pomeroy (Colin Salmon) to pick up some tech. They watch a brief video in which a bio-weapon called MEDUSA was the cause of the destruction brought on by the Sixty Minute War. Tom is sent away by the snooping Chief Navigator named Herbert Malliphant (Andrew Lees) to London's lower level so that he can spend a moment with Kate, but she ends up accompanying Tom to his destination.The people of Salzhaken are brought in for processing. Valentine descends to oversee things as one of the guards assaults a man from the small town. Hester gets closer to Valentine, which Tom manages to see. He calls out to Valentine to warn him, but Hester manages to stab Valentine quickly. She pulls off her scarf to reveal her facial scar and tells Valentine this is for her mother Pandora. Before she can kill Valentine, she is stopped by Tom, who chases her to a waste chute. Hester is about to jump until Tom grabs her wrist. She tells Tom to ask Valentine what he did to her mother and how he gave Hester her scar before she lets herself free of Tom's grip and falls down the chute. Valentine arrives moments after, and Tom starts to ask what Hester meant by what she said. Valentine responds by pushing Tom down the chute right before Kate and other people arrive, telling them that Tom fell in as a result of fighting Hester. Kate notices that another man, Bevis Pod (Ronan Raftery), saw the whole thing.Hester and Tom are dropped on the outskirts of an unknown location. She picks his pockets and steals his money and knife before heading off on her own. Tom wakes up and follows Hester, thinking they should stick together, but she wants nothing to do with him. Not long after, they are spotted by scavengers and taken into a town called Scuttlebug.Valentine speaks to London's mayor Magnus Crome (Patrick Malahide) over his plans for where to take London, but Crome has his doubts over whatever Valentine is planning, due to London living by the philosophy of Municipal Darwinism. Valentine then goes to visit his top scientist Dr. Twix (Sarah Peirse) as she is in the process of developing a weapon for Valentine. She also offers Valentine a solution for dealing with Hester.Kate goes to find Bevis and ask what he saw. He is hesitant to say since he knows it will get him in trouble, but he finally admits to Kate that he saw her father push Tom down the chute. What's more is Bevis knows that Valentine is covering something up and is building something inside St. Paul's Cathedral, and the two try to figure out a way to get inside.The people that take Hester and Tom in appear hospitable, but they keep the two locked in a cell. Hester then tells Tom about how she lost her mother when she was 8. Valentine was good friends with Pandora (Caren Pistorius) and always treated Hester kindly until the day that Pandora and Valentine both found something that Pandora knew Valentine wanted for his own dark purposes. They fought over it, and Valentine stabbed Pandora in front of Hester and slashed Hester's face when she tried to save her mother. Before dying, Pandora gave Hester a necklace with an eye symbol, and Hester escaped.Valentine goes to an offshore prison to find Shrike, who is a half-cyborg/half-zombie-like creature who has a history with Hester. He is angry with her for going back on a promise she made to him, and he wants her dead. Valentine destroys the prison and lets Shrike run free to go after Hester.Hester and Tom are brought before an auction in Rustwater where they are to be sold off as slaves. When Hester is brought up for purchase, a woman named Anna Fang (Jihae) steps out and claims she will take Hester. The auctioneer knows that Anna is a fugitive wanted by London with a price on her head, but Anna frees Hester and Tom after killing the auctioneer and several of his men. They board her aircraft, the Jenny Haniver, but they are also spotted by Shrike. He attempts to climb up and catch them as Tom is climbing the rope to the aircraft. Anna throws Hester a knife to cut Tom loose, but she throws it to Tom to cut Shrike loose. As they fly toward their next destination, Anna talks to Hester and says she knew Pandora and has been trying to find Hester since Pandora's death.Herbert goes to find Valentine to suck up to him by informing him that a cache of old tech has been discovered, and Herbert now has Valentine's attention.Hester explains to Tom how she knows Shrike. After running away as a child, Shrike found her and raised her for years like his own. He had always noticed how sad Hester was, and he offered a solution to make the pain go away. Shrike revealed a robotic body he made for Hester, so that she can die and be reborn as a machine with no memory of the horrors of her childhood. She almost took him up on the offer until she heard about Valentine being close, so she headed off to hunt him down and left Shrike alone and angered by her deception.Anna brings Hester and Tom to Airhaven, where they meet her partners in the Anti-Traction League. She tells Hester that Pandora was trying to hide something from Valentine. Meanwhile, Kate and Bevis do more investigating by speaking to Pomeroy. He quietly leads them through a tunnel into the cathedral where Kate sees the large MEDUSA weapon that Valentine is holding. She also watches as he shoots down Crome when he finds the weapon himself. Anna and her team are trying to find a way to stop the weapon, as Valentine is planning to bring it to Shan Guo, a non-mobile city that was formerly China, and destroy the wall that seals it off before taking down the rest of the city. Just then, Shrike enters and starts to attack and kill Anna's teammates. Airhaven starts to go down in flames as the survivors try to escape. Shrike goes after Hester and Tom and nearly kills Tom until Hester pleads with him to leave Tom. Shrike realizes Hester is in love with Tom. He also notices he has been heavily damaged in the fight, and he is going to die for good. He releases Hester from her promise and lets her go. She tearfully leaves him, and Shrike's final thoughts are of Hester as a child. She and Tom escape with Anna and a few others.Valentine prepares to take London toward Shan Guo. Anna talks to Governor Kwan (Kee Chan) to help launch the Anti-Tractionist fleet against London. The heroes fly toward London as they inch closer and closer to the wall. Valentine raises MEDUSA to fire the first powerful blast against the wall. Kate sees what kind of man her father truly is, and she refuses to side with him. Many of Anna's teammates are shot down and killed as another blast hits the wall. Hester and Anna manage to make it to London and head to St. Paul's. Hester finds that her mother's necklace holds the kill drive for MEDUSA. Valentine and Anna fight as Hester goes to shut down MEDUSA before the final blast can fully take the wall down. Valentine fatally impales Anna, but she lives long enough to see MEDUSA shut down.Valentine still plans to ram London into the wall at the cost of millions of lives. Kate tries to stop London's engine, but it won't budge. Tom flies the Jenny Haniver toward the engine to blast it to bits, causing London to slow down. Valentine tries to get away on his own aircraft until Hester pursues him. He reveals to her that he is her father, having been in love with Pandora before her death. When Hester has a chance to kill Valentine, she chooses not to. She hops on the Jenny Haniver with Tom before he fires a blast at Valentine's craft, sending it crashing to the ground. Valentine survives, but only long enough to see that London's tracks are about to crush him. Hester sighs upon looking at this and laughs in victory.Kate leads the Londoners to the top of Shan Guo's wall where she peacefully greets Kwan, and he accepts them in for sanctuary. As the sun rises, Hester and Tom embrace as they take the Jenny Haniver to travel the world."
Hunter Killer,2018,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1846589/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"An untested American submarine captain teams with U.S. Navy Seals to rescue the Russian president, who has been kidnapped by a rogue general. A U.S. submarine, the USS Tampa Bay, vanishes while shadowing a Russian Akula-class submarine in the Arctic. Rear Admiral John Fisk sends a Virginia-class submarine, the USS Arkansas, under the command of newly-promoted and unorthodox Commander Joe Glass to investigate. At the same time, a Navy SEAL team under the command of Lieutenant Bill Beaman is sent in to discreetly observe a Russian naval base. When they arrive at the naval base, they witness defense minister Dmitri Durov conducting a coup d'etat and taking Russian President Zakarin prisoner, and swiftly realize that Durov intends to trigger a war.. When the USS Tampa Bay submarine that is navigating in Russian waters loses contact with the American base, Captain Joe Glass is assigned to command the USS Arkansas submarine to investigate. They discover the USS Tampa Bay and a Russian submarine sunk with survivors inside. However they are attacked by another Russian submarine hidden under an iceberg but they explode the enemy. Then they rescue the survivors, including the Russian Captain Andropov. Meanwhile a commando led by Lieutenant Bill Beaman is sent to observe a Russian base and they find that a coup d'état is in progress with the defense minister Dmitriy Durov overthrowing the Russian President Nikolai Zakarin. Now Beaman and Glass are assigned to try to rescue Zakarin to avoid a nuclear war, but the only chance to the USS Arkansas reach the Russian base waters is with the help of Captain Andropov. Will he collaborate with Glass?—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil A U.S. submarine, the USS Tampa Bay, vanishes while shadowing a Russian Akula-class submarine in the Arctic. Rear Admiral John Fisk (Common) sends a Virginia-class submarine, the USS Arkansas, under the command of newly-promoted and unorthodox Commander Joe Glass (Gerard Butler) to investigate.Jayne Norquist (Linda Cardellini), National Security Agency senior analyst, analyzes this incident with the upcoming meeting of Russin Defence minister with Russin President Zakarin. She senses something is wrong with the timing of the attack on the US sub and recommends putting eyes and ears on the ground where the meeting is taking place.At the same time, a Navy SEAL team under the command of Lieutenant Bill Beaman (Toby Stephens) is sent in to discreetly observe a Russian naval base, but their mission is swiftly complicated when Martinelli (Zane Holtz), the team's new DM recruit, is rendered unconscious during the HALO drop. When they arrive at the naval base, they witness defense minister Dmitri Durov (Mikhail Gorevoy) conducting a coup and taking Russian President Zakarin (Alexander Diachenko) prisoner, and swiftly realize that Durov intends to trigger a war.Meanwhile, the Arkansas discovers the lost U.S. submarine (due to a torpedo attack), and also finds a sunken Russian submarine damaged in a manner that suggests internal sabotage rather than external attack. They are attacked by another Russian submarine that has been hiding under an iceberg, but Glass is able to destroy the ambush person and rescue Russian survivors from the wreck, including submarine captain Sergei Andropov (Michael Nyqvist).Back at base, the U.S. government learns about the coup. Admiral Charles Donnegan (Gary Oldman) recommends preparing for war, while Fisk (under advisement from Jayne that US is dealing with only a rouge general and the entire Russian military and hence deploying the fleet might play into Durov's hand by forcing a war) suggests that the Arkansas be sent to rendezvous with Beaman's team after they have rescued Zakarin. Glass manages to convince the reluctant Andropov to help, and with Andropov's knowledge of the minefield around the base, Glass navigates the Arkansas near the base undetected. Meanwhile, Beaman's team infiltrate the base and succeed in retrieving President Zakarin, but lose two teammates in the process. He delivers the injured president to the Arkansas's DSRV, then goes back alone for Martinelli, whom he was forced to leave behind due to prior injuries.As U.S. and Russian fleets face off for battle, the Arkansas sustains further damage when they are attacked by Andropov's old ship - a heavily armed destroyer now commanded by Sutrev (Ilia Volok), a member of Durov's conspiracy - but Andropov is able to communicate a message affirming that President Zakarin is aboard the submarine. When Durov orders his forces at the base to fire missiles at the surfaced Arkansas, Glass refuses to take action, recognizing that firing back at the Russians could start the war he is trying to stop. In the last seconds, Andropov's old crew-mates defy orders and destroy the incoming missiles with CIWS before they can strike the Arkansas, and subsequently destroy Durov's naval base headquarters with their missiles. With the war averted, Glass docks the Arkansas to the Russian naval base to return Zakarin and Andropov's surviving crew to their country. Glass and Andropov bid farewell and confirm their respect for each other. Beaman returns with an injured Martinelli, and the Arkansas crew travels to the U.S."
If Beale Street Could Talk,2018,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7125860/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A young woman embraces her pregnancy while she and her family set out to prove her childhood friend and lover innocent of a crime he didn't commit. African-American teen sweethearts Fonny and Tish are ripped apart when Fonny is wrongly arrested for the rape of a Puerto Rican woman because of the machinations of a racist cop. While seeking justice for Fonny, a pregnant Tish relies on her Harlem community, including her sister, mother Sharon and future mother-in-law. In early 1970s Harlem, daughter and wife-to-be Tish vividly recalls the passion, respect and trust that have connected her and her artist fiancé Alonzo Hunt, who goes by the nickname Fonny. Friends since childhood, the devoted couple dream of a future together, but their plans are derailed when Fonny is arrested for a crime he did not commit.—Jwelch5742 Having known each other since childhood, two ardent young lovers in early-1970s Harlem--the nineteen-year-old, Tish, and her twenty-two-year-old self-made sculptor beau, Fonny--have all the time in the world to plan their shared future. However, a hideous crime on the other side of the town paired with a flagrant abuse of power will have a wrongfully accused Fonny singled out at a police line-up, incarcerating him for an atrocity he didn't commit. Now, an unending lone quest for justice begins, as life's unstoppable force blesses both saints and sinners. But, is love enough against the injustice of a cruel world?—Nick Riganas Set in the 1970s Tish (Kiki Layne) is a 19-year-old African-American woman living in West Harlem, New York City, and she is madly in love with Fonny (Stephan James), a fellow African American man who is a few years older than her. He is kind and warm and loves her deeply.Tish goes to the prison where Fonny is incarcerated to tell him that she's having a baby. Both of them are thrilled, the circumstances non-withstanding. Tish goes home sees her mother Sharon (Regina King). Sharon asks how Fonny is doing - he's in jail after being falsely identified in a rape case and is currently on trial. Tish nervously tell Sharon she is pregnant, and Sharon helps her tell the rest of the family: her father Joseph (Colman Domingo) and her sister Ernestine (Teyonah Parris). They are a little shocked but supportive, a tight-knit, loving group. After wondering when they should tell Fonny's family, Sharon decides to invite them over for drinks since it's a Saturday night and no time like the present.Throughout the film, we cut back to Tish and Fonny's life before he went to prison. We seem on an early date, walking through the city and getting to know one another. Back in the present, Fonny's parents, the jokester Frank (Michael Beach) and the cruel, religious Mrs. Hunt (Aunjanue Ellis) arrive with their two daughters. Mrs. Hunt and their daughters think they are too good for Tish and her family. When they tell Fonny's family, only Frank is positive. Mrs. Hunt curses Tish, and tells her the child is born from sin and is going to shrivel in her womb - and Frank punches her, hard. Everyone scrambles, Joseph takes Frank out, and Mrs. Hunt's daughters help her up. Sharon and Ernestine properly shame Mrs. Hunt, asking how she could be so cruel, and they kick the women out of their home.As the flashbacks continue, we see Tish and Fonny sleep together for the first time. In the present, Sharon and Tish go to see Hayward (Finn Wittrock), a lawyer that is going to take Fonny's defense. Victoria Rogers (Emily Rios), the victim, was a Puerto Rican woman living in New York when she was brutally assaulted. A white police officer, Officer Bell (Ed Skrein), claims he saw Fonny running from the scene of the crime, even though Fonny was with his friend Daniel Carty (Brian Tyree Henry) at the time. He then showed Victoria the lineup, and she identified Fonny. Hayward explains there are two problems: one, Victoria is missing and can't be questioned. Two, the district attorney's office has arrested Carty and won't let Hayward see him. Hayward is going to fight but warns them it will be a tough battle to win.In flashbacks, Daniel gets out of prison after two years and comes to stay with Fonny and Tish. He is jovial, but his time in prison has shaken him. He clearly is drinking as a way to cope and confesses to Fonny that he pled guilty to stealing a car to get out of a marijuana charge after being pressured by police officers... even though he doesn't even know how to drive.Tish gets farther along in her pregnancy, working as a counter girl in a department store to make ends meet. Ernestine tells Tish that Victoria has been located... in Puerto Rico. Tish is devastated, knowing she can't get there to talk to her. Money is piling up for legal defenses, and Frank commiserates with Joseph, who assures him they'll get it done. They begin stealing from the docks and re-selling the goods.In flashbacks, we see when Tish and Fonny got their loft together. They had been turned away from many places simply for being black, but Levy (Dave Franco), the young Jewish man showing them the space, tells them that love is love and he's his mother's son. Tish looks around a corner store while Fonny goes to get cigarettes, and while in the store, a young racist white man starts harassing her. Fonny arrives and throws the man out of the store, but Officer Bell (the man who will later say he saw Fonny running from the crime scene) arrives and threatens Fonny with assault charges. Tish and Fonny explain that he was defending Tish, but Bell refuses to listen and begins to arrest Fonny until the store manager, a white woman, comes forward and tells Bell that what they said was true and to leave them alone. Bell vows to see Fonny again.Sharon arrives in Puerto Rico, attempting to find Victoria. She first finds Pietro (Pedro Pascal), Victoria's boyfriend. He at first refuses to help her find Victoria, but she passionately insists that Fonny didn't rape her and begs to speak with her. He helps her find Victoria, who is visibly traumatized from what happened to her. Sharon tries to speak with her, acknowledging what happened to her was horrible but trying to explain that she has the wrong man. Victoria explains that the police asked her to pick Fonny out and she did and that that's the end.

The Girl in the Spider's Web,2018,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5177088/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Young computer hacker Lisbeth Salander and journalist Mikael Blomkvist find themselves caught in a web of spies, cybercriminals and corrupt government officials. Scarred forever by the hideous and unforgivable sins of her father, the antisocial, technologically brilliant computer hacker, Lisbeth Salander, finds herself ridding Stockholm of sadists who hate women. It's been three silent years since she last saw her old journalist friend, Mikael Blomkvist, after the events ofThe Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2011), and now, Lisbeth is with her back to the wall, hunted down like prey for stealing Project FireFall: a powerful tool designed for the Americans, developed to breach and control most online defence systems. Now, as the NSA, the Swedish Security Service, and deadly Russians are hot on her trail, more and more, Lisbeth's horrible past comes back to haunt her, and no one in this world is safe if the state-of-the-art computer software falls into the wrong hands. What does the future have in store for Lisbeth Salander, the girl in the spider's web?—Nick Riganas The film opens in Sweden as a young Lisbeth Salander (Beau Gadsdon) is playing chess with her sister Camilla (Carlotta Von Falkenhayn). One of Camilla's pieces is knocked over, and a spider crawls out. Moments later, the girls' father, Alexander Zalachenko (Mikael Persbrandt), comes in and orders them into his room. He comments how Camilla is growing, and he has her sit beside him. Sensing his lurid intentions, Lisbeth grabs Camilla and runs back to their room. Lisbeth runs outside their balcony and gets ready to jump. She waits for Camilla to join her, but Camilla rejoins Alexander when he orders them to go back to him. Lisbeth jumps and slides down the hill below the house, and she escapes, never to return home.Over 20 years later, we find a CEO in Sweden who has beaten his wife. The lights go out in his house, and he goes to turn them back on, only to see Lisbeth (now played by Claire Foy) standing there as a dark hooded figure with eerie makeup to obscure her face. She knocks over a statue tied with a rope that wraps around the CEO's feet and hangs him upside down. Lisbeth tells him that she knows of his deeds, like beating up two prostitutes and sleeping with the wife of a man who bankrolled his company. Lisbeth says she has removed all of his funds and put them in the accounts of the prostitutes and the man's wife, if the wife will simply give her the codes. The wife hesitates for a moment, then gives Lisbeth the account codes and takes her daughter away. The CEO says that whatever Lisbeth does now, he'll just have it reversed. Lisbeth shows him a video of the CEO screwing his boss's wife, and threatens to distribute it if he contacts his own wife and daughter again. Lisbeth leaves the man screaming and pissing himself.Mikael Blomkvist (Sverrir Gudnason) arrives at work and shows displeasure toward the new owner of Millennium Magazine, which he bought from Mikael. He talks to publisher Erika Berger (Vicky Krieps) and invites her to join him later, but she says she has plans with her husband.Meanwhile, Lisbeth finishes having sex with a woman named Sofia (Andreja Pejic). Sofia goes through Lisbeth's pictures and sees one of her and Camilla as children, and guesses it's her sister. Lisbeth comments that Camilla killed herself three years earlier, and she is glad that both her and their father are dead. Lisbeth curtly dismisses Sofia so she can go back to work. After Sofia leaves, Lisbeth receives a message regarding something highly valuable.Lisbeth meets with Frans Balder (Stephen Merchant), a former contractor for the National Security Agency. He informs Lisbeth of a program he developed called Firefall, which has the power to access the world's nuclear launch codes, and he feels that, in the wrong hands, it can lead to dangerous and devastating results. He regretted doing it and now Balder hires Lisbeth to steal Firefall back from NSA.At the NSA headquarters in Washington, security expert Edwin Needham (Lakeith Stanfield) sees an alert for an unauthorized user in their system. He attempts to shut their systems down, but it's too late, and Lisbeth has taken Firefall and left a taunting image to Needham.Lisbeth attempts to access Firefall, but finds herself unable to do so because it requires answers to a series of cryptic prompts to activate it. Soon, a trio of masked thugs break into Lisbeth's apartment and try shooting at her, one bullet hitting her in the back of the left shoulder, in her dragon tattoo. The leader of the thugs turns on the gas and leaves some particles on an alarm clock to create sparks, causing an explosion in the apartment that Lisbeth narrowly escapes by jumping into the tub. The thugs have also taken Firefall from her. As the police arrive on the scene Lisbeth tries to escape on her motorcycle but is surrounded by police. She finally drives off a pier and escapes by driving over the frozen lake.Balder sees the explosion from Lisbeth's apartment at the spot where he was set to rendezvous with her, and he thinks Lisbeth has taken Firefall for herself.Balder gets in touch with Gabriella Grane (Synnove Macody Lund), the deputy director of the Swedish Secret Service, after believing that Lisbeth has turned on him. Not long after, Needham arrives in Sweden to retrieve Firefall for the NSA, but Grane and her men intercept him since they think he's there on work business. Needham tells Grane he is there for pleasure, and she warns him that if he is there for any other reason than for a vacation, she will have him arrested and sent back to the States.Lisbeth goes to the home of Plague (Cameron Britton), an ally of hers, for assistance. Not long after, she reaches out to Mikael, and the two start to work together to find out who took Firefall. Mikael investigates a surveillance photo of the masked leader of the men that broke in, whom he recognizes from another photo where he had worked with Alexander as part of a gang. Mikael finds a spider tattoo on him and traces it back to a man named Milos Meer (Hendrik Heutmann). Milos explains that what he has is not a tattoo, but a scar given to him by the group that he is looking for, the Spiders. He says he had encountered the Spiders before. He pulls off a full-face mask to reveal that his nose and upper lip had been crudely cut off leaving him horribly disfigured. Milos warns Mikael not to go asking about the Spiders.Needham finds a name tag bracelet of Sofia in Lisbeth's burned apartment and goes to a club where he finds Sofia, knowing of her connection to Lisbeth. After convincing her that Lisbeth can't be trusted, she gives Needham her phone so that he can contact Lisbeth. As he does so, Lisbeth is monitoring the Spiders' movements to try and catch them. Lisbeth tricks Needham into thinking she was fooled by him and sabotages his attempt to find her. She then spots Jan Holtser (Claes Bang) and his goons kill the policemen guarding Balder through a security camera. Having watched the scene on a camera she placed, Lisbeth goes to find Balder and his son August (Christopher Convery), but Holtser reaches them at the same time. After a struggle, Holtser overpowers Lisbeth, injects her with a drug, and while she is conscious but unable to move he uses her hand to shoot and kill Balder. They then take August with them, leaving her on the floor to die. Through an enormous effort, Lisbeth reaches a bottle of pills, dumps some on the floor, crushes them into powder with the bottle, and inhales the powder. She begins to recover enough to get out of the building. She gets into the police car that had been guarding the building, pulling out the dead driver. Lisbeth pursues them and hacks into their car's remote access feature to cause their airbags to deploy, which knocks the villains unconscious and makes their car slow down so Lisbeth can safely get August out. They turn to drive away when a truck comes over the bridge to pursue them. Lisbeth climbs up a bridge tower, smashes safety glass, and activates the bridge-raising mechanism, leaving the truck high above her car, unable to follow. Then Lisbeth sees Camilla dressed in red, standing in the road watching her leave. Then she realizes that Camilla is behind the plot to take August.Lisbeth brings August to stay with her at a safe location. He has a strange lack of emotion over his father's death, and says he would like to go back to his mother. After he beats her at a chess game in only a few moves, she realizes he is a genius. She asks for his help in unlocking Firefall, and after earning his trust, he explains to her that the phrases she needs to decode are complex number problems based on the letters used, which is something that Balder knew his son could figure out.Needham is eventually found by Grane when he is snooping around the building where Balder was killed. Grane has him arrested and locked up. Lisbeth manages to remotely unlock his holding cell and lead him to a hidden cell phone where he is able to communicate with her. With Plague's help, Lisbeth convinces Needham to take August with him to America to rejoin his mother. Needham agrees, but he says he won't go back home without Firefall. He leaves with Plague.Soon, Lisbeth is led to the true mastermind behind the Spiders -- Camilla (now played by Sylvia Hoeks). She took over the Spiders from her father after his death. It is also revealed that Grane was the client in the scheme to steal Firefall. Grane wanted Sweden to get control of Firefall so it could never be used; she did not trust the U.S. to have the wisdom to have custody of it. Camilla says that the Spiders changed their mind, and they are going to keep it. She kills Grane by slitting her jugular vein with a razor-sharp blade hidden in the ring. She and her henchmen kidnap August and take him to their hideout, which is her and Lisbeth's childhood home.Camilla orders August to unlock Firefall, and she gets Holtser to show Lisbeth a video where they have Mikael hostage. Holtser threatens to inject Mikael with two needles filled with serums; one will blind him, and the other will kill him. Lisbeth convinces August to solve the codes to unlock Firefall, but before Camilla and her men can access it, suddenly we hear a ""ping"" and one man falls. Plague is in a van with an infrared scanner, giving Needham targeting information so he can act as a sniper with a very high-powered weapon integrated to the equipment in the van helping him target the men inside the building. He takes down the gang one by one, shooting right through walls. Lisbeth makes it in and takes out some henchmen herself, even injecting Holtser with the first serum. Camilla tries to escape with another henchman, and Holtser emerges from the woods in front of the car, now barely able to see as a result of the serum. Camilla congratulates the driver on the successful escape inadvertently distracting him from the road at the exact moment the blind Holtser stumbles in the path of the car. The car hits him and runs off the road and crashes. Lisbeth pursues Camilla until they reach the side of a cliff, and Lisbeth aims her gun at Camilla. She knows of Lisbeth's reputation for helping victimized women, but she asks Lisbeth why she didn't go back to help her. Camilla said she suffered at the hands of their father for 16 years, always wondering why Lisbeth abandoned her. Lisbeth tearfully states that it's because Camilla chose their father. Camilla realizes she has become the monster that their father was, and she lets herself fall off the edge of the cliff to her death, echoing the initial scene where Lisbeth falls off the balcony to escape. Camilla leaves only the laptop with Firefall on the ground where she last stood. A bit later Needham tries to access Firefall, only to find it has been deleted, with a message saying ""This is what Balder would have wanted.""Mikael is in his office writing a new article in which he details Lisbeth and Camilla's whole ordeal, but he decides to erase the whole thing instead of having it published.In the final scene, Lisbeth goes to her home one last time as she rigs the place to blow up. She watches it go up in flames and rides away into the night on her motorcycle."

Megan is recovering from a stress caused by a situation where her partner died. Megan receives the corpse of a young woman named Hannah Grace and later a man tries to burn the body in the incinerator but Megan and the security team hold and arrest the man. Soon Megan has the weird sensation that Hannah Grace is recovering from her injuries but her friend Lisa believes she is still using drugs and does not believe in her. But soon she realizes that there is something evil in the cadaver.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Still struggling to cope with sensitive psychological issues after the death of her partner, the former Boston Police Department officer, Megan Reed, is trying to put her life back on track. In high hopes of making a fresh start, Megan lands a job as the overnight intake assistant at a Boston hospital morgue, and on her first night, the cold, lifeless body of a brutally murdered young woman arrives. But, as Reed begins the procedure before storing the hacked corpse, mysterious things start happening, and swift movements catch her eye. Did the dead woman bring something otherworldly along? Indeed, this is going to be one long night shift. What's the story behind the savaged cadaver of Hannah Grace?—Nick Riganas The film opens as two priests are in the middle of an exorcism. Hannah Grace (Kirby Johnson) is possessed by an inhuman force, and her body painfully contorts. Her father Grainger (Louis Herthum) sits by her side as he desperately waits for the priests to do their work and pleads with Hannah to fight her demon. Suddenly, Hannah's body rises, and she appears to have a hold on the priests. She sends one flying against the wall where he is impaled through the head, while the other priest starts to choke. Grainger grabs a pillow and smothers Hannah until she stops moving.Three months later in Boston, Megan Reed (Shay Mitchell) is heading to a job interview at Boston Metro Hospital. Her friend/AA sponsor Lisa (Stana Katic) has hooked Megan up with a job working the graveyard shift in the morgue as an intake assistant. She goes through an interview with Dr. Lewis (James A. Watson, Jr.), who shows her the ins and outs of the area and asks if she can handle the position since a lot of people have quit on him because they couldn't handle the solitude around corpses, as well as the smell. Megan assures Dr. Lewis that she can handle the job.Megan starts later that evening. She meets two security guards at the front, Ernie (Jacob Ming-Trent) and Dave (Max McNamara) before heading into the morgue. She works until an EMT brings in a fresh body. In the middle of her work, Megan starts to get haunted by a recent traumatic memory. As she worked as a police officer, she was facing a perp and hesitated to shoot him until he turned around and fired his gun. The man shot and killed her partner then ran off. The guilt and horror of it led Megan to abuse pills, which landed her in rehab.The next day, Megan is visited by her ex, a cop named Andrew (Grey Damon), who is there to pick up the rest of his stuff. He questions whether or not her new job is a good idea, and the two have a brief argument before Andrew decides to go home.Megan returns to work that night and finds a hooded man (Grainger) standing outside asking to be let in. She rightfully doesn't trust him, and he starts to angrily order her to let him in until Megan threatens to call security on him. Moments later, an EMT named Randy (Nick Thune) shows up with the body of a young woman who was apparently being mutilated as she was found. Megan steps outside to help Randy, not seeing Grainger sneaking inside behind her. After Randy leaves, Megan inspects the body, which turns out to be Hannah. She tries to take pictures of the body, but the camera and computer don't work. Other weird things happen, like a tremor in the room, or the drawer with Hannah's body not staying shut. When she goes back to see the body, she notices flies around Hannah, and a whole swarm of them when she lifts off her sheets, but this turns out to be a hallucination...possibly.Megan hears something outside and goes to check it out, but she finds nothing. She goes back into the morgue to find Hannah's body is gone, and she sees Grainger trying to take it away. She goes to confront him, and he tries to attack her with a knife, but Megan disarms him and waits for security to come get him. As Grainger is getting arrested, he yells to Megan that Hannah isn't really dead.After Megan returns Hannah's body, she gets a call from Andrew to check up on her since he heard about the incident, though she doesn't notice Hannah's body moving. When Megan does get a look at Hannah, she sees her mouth open and exhale. She gets Lisa to meet with her now that she's freaked out. Lisa tells her she can go home if she wants, but Megan insists that she needs to do this. She tells Lisa about Hannah breathing, but Lisa says that corpses release air sometimes when they are moved.Andrew goes to visit Megan, but he accuses her of taking a bottle of Xanax that he had. She gets angry that he would suggest that she is using again, and she orders him to get lost.Dave tries to entertain himself when he hears something weird in the morgue. He goes to investigate and goes next to Hannah's drawer where he hears the noise. A powerful force then lifts him up on his feet and starts to painfully break his bones until it pulls him into the drawer. Meanwhile, Megan is in the bathroom when she sees a corroded hand reaching for something outside the stall. Growing more paranoid, Megan asks Ernie to view morgue footage. She sees Hannah crawling in the darkness from one of the cameras. Megan starts to look into Hannah's death and tells Lisa what she found out about it. Lisa later goes outside for a smoke but is stalked by Hannah. She is followed up to the rooftop where Hannah twists Lisa's body until her neck snaps.Randy returns with a new body, and Megan has him come inside to see Hannah's body, which made its way back to the drawer. The body appears to be healing following the deaths of Dave and Lisa. Randy notices Megan isn't well and he tries to make an innocent assumption about her state of being, as he was in a similar position himself a while back. Randy then leaves, and Megan talks to Andrew on the phone regarding the Xanax bottle, saying that she didn't take it or use it, but he says it's okay. Outside, Hannah finds Randy and kills him, making it look like his head was smashed between the wall and his truck. Megan sees Hannah on the security footage and tries to go find Randy, but he's already dead.Andrew calls Megan to tell her that Grainger escaped police custody and he's heading back to the hospital. When he does get there, he tells Megan what she has seen, that Hannah's body is healing itself with each kill, and that they need to completely destroy her body by burning it. Megan reluctantly helps Grainger bring the body to the incinerator, but Hannah takes hold of Grainger's body and forces him to the incinerator, killing him.Andrew shows up to help Megan, who is trying to run from Hannah. Hannah catches Ernie and slits his throat before heading after Megan and Andrew. She starts to grab onto Andrew and twist him around, but Megan takes his gun and shoots Hannah until she drops to the floor. She lets Andrew out of hospital and take Hannah's body back to the incinerator where Hannah appears alive again. She attacks Megan, but she manages to shove Hannah into the incinerator, even as she starts pleading for Megan not to.Sometimes later, Megan has recovered and is ready to move forward in life. After had a shower, she sees a fly on the mirror wall and swats it with her hand."
Eighth Grade,2018,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7014006/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"An introverted teenage girl tries to survive the last week of her disastrous eighth grade year before leaving to start high school. In his feature film directorial debut, comedian Bo Burnham deftly encapsulates the awkwardness, angst, self-loathing and reinvention that a teenage girl goes through on the cusp of high school. Given that the 27-year-old stand-up comic achieved fame as a teenager himself through YouTube by riffing on his insecurities, he is uniquely capable as the film's writer and director to tell the story of Kayla, an anxious girl navigating the final days of her eighth grade year, despite creating a protagonist female instead of male. Like Burnham did more than a decade ago, 13-year-old Kayla turns to YouTube to express herself, where she makes advice blogs in which she pretends to have it all together. In reality, Kayla is sullen and silent around her single father and her peers at school, carrying out most of her interactions with her classmates on Instagram and Twitter. Her YouTube videos are a clever narrative tool that provide insight into her inner hopes and dreams, much like an inspirational online diary. One of Eighth Grade's biggest triumphs is in its realism. Kayla Day is an eighth grade student finishing her final week at a public middle school in the state of New York. She posts motivational videos on YouTube about confidence and self-image that get almost no views. Struggling to make friends at school, she wins the ""Most Quiet"" award from her classmates. Meanwhile, Mark, her single father, struggles to connect with her and break her reliance on social media. She is invited to a pool party hosted by a classmate, Kennedy, who has done so only after being forced by her mother. At the party, Kayla has an anxiety attack in the bathroom but eventually goes outside to swim, where she meets Gabe, Kennedy's eccentric cousin. After trying to leave the party, Kayla has an awkward encounter with her crush, Aiden, who suggests that she rejoin the group. She overcomes her fear and volunteers to sing karaoke.

Kayla mentions to him in passing that she has a dirty photos folder on her phone, which piques his interest. He asks if she gives blowjobs, and she says yes, not knowing what it means. She later looks it up online and, although disgusted, attempts to practice on a banana. Her dad walks in before she can try it, and calls her bluff by reminding her that she doesn't like bananas.Kayla attends a high school shadow program, where she meets Olivia, a senior who immediately takes a liking to her. Olivia gives Kayla her number. Kayla calls her later in the day to thank her for showing her around the high school. Olivia reassures Kayla that middle school is messy and to not worry so much about what her peers think of her. She then invites her to hang out at the Palisades Center Mall with some of her friends. They have a good time, though Kayla spots Mark spying from afar and, embarrassed, tells him to leave. Olivia's friend Riley gives Kayla a ride home late at night, and he initiates an awkward game of truth or dare where he asks about her sexual experience, takes off his shirt, and asks her to remove hers. She refuses and he angrily backs off, claiming he was just trying to help her get some experience with boys. Kayla breaks down at home and is comforted by her father. She makes a video announcing that she intends to stop making videos, as she feels unfit to give advice when she is not even able to follow her own.Kayla opens a time capsule she created for herself in sixth grade. She watches a video she made for herself, where her past self asks questions about Kayla's friends and love life. She asks her dad to help her burn the time capsule and asks if she makes him sad. He says that she fills him with pride and he could never be sad about her, which relieves her.At graduation, Kayla rebukes Kennedy for ignoring her thank-you letter and acting indifferent towards her despite Kayla's attempts to be nice. She later hangs out at Gabe's house and they have a fun time together. Kayla makes a new time capsule which she and her father bury in the backyard; she leaves a video message for her high school self encouraging her to persevere through tough times."

Upgrade,2018,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6499752/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Set in the near-future, technology controls nearly all aspects of life. But when the world of Grey, a self-labeled technophobe, is turned upside down, his only hope for revenge is an experimental computer chip implant. Grey's a stay-at-home mechanic, whose wife is Asha. One day, Grey asks Asha to help him return a car to his client. Whilst Grey and Asha's self-driving car malfunctions, it crashes. Grey watches helplessly as Asha bleeds to death next to him. Grey returns home - a widowed quadriplegic, under the care of his mother. His wife's death and the inability of police to identify their attackers cause him to sink into a depression. After a suicide attempt, he's offered to have high tech chip implanted - enabling him to walk. Though initially hesitant, he's persuaded to have the surgery. In a not-so-distant future, where the machines have seamlessly integrated into the multifaceted aspects of our lives, the world relies almost entirely on technology to do even the most complicated tasks for us. As a result, more and more, the old-school, tech-shy car mechanic, Grey Trace, is feeling like a fish out of water; a stubbornly analogue man living in a brave new digital world. Then, suddenly, a terrible late-night incident robs Grey of his happiness, leaving him an empty quadriplegic. Now, the reclusive tech mogul, Eron Keen, comes up with an offer, promising Trace to bridge the painful gap between his unresponsive limbs and his brain with the aid of his latest, state-of-the-art invention: the powerful Stem microchip. But, what if the cure is worse than the disease?—Nick Riganas It's sometime in the near future. Grey Trace, in liking the tactile satisfaction of working with his hands in being a mechanic, has not embraced the technological revolution, unlike his wife Asha Trace, who works for one of the larger computer companies and who uses an electronically controlled, fully autonomous vehicle to get around. In a violent attack by a group against them, it happening even with technological safeguards to prevent such, Asha is killed and Grey rendered a quadriplegic. After months on the case with those technological advances providing little usable information, Police Detective Cortez has only had a few leads which seemingly have got her and, by association, Grey no closer to catching the perpetrators. Partly in a gesture as a friend, reclusive computer genius Eron Keen, one of Grey's customers, has developed a revolutionary new technology that he is calling Stem which he believes would alleviate Grey's physical disabilities. Not turning Grey into a robot, Stem instead would be a conduit between Grey's brain and his motor functions. Initially reluctant to go through with the procedure (to have Stem implanted) in not having anything to live for, Grey ultimately agrees, with Eron's caveat that Grey cannot tell anyone (Eron needing to keep the technology under wraps for the time being). Grey therefore leads a double life as a fully functioning human and a wheelchair bound quadriplegic. However, Grey discovers that Stem not only will allow him to walk again, but also to act in superhuman way. Stem, that can talk via a sound wave generated voice only to Grey, is an artificial intelligence that can take control of Grey upon Grey's okay. This development leads to a standoff of sorts between three people: Grey, while abhorring violence in its general nature, wants to use Stem to exact revenge against those who killed Asha (the attack against them appeared targeted as opposed to random); Detective Cortez who comes to believe that Grey, despite being confined to a wheelchair, is behind attacks perpetrated against people that were on her suspect list; and Eron who may want to shut down Stem if he discovers that Grey is using Stem for unauthorized purposes, such as vigilante acts by Grey which would indeed contravene their gentlemen's agreement.—Huggo Set sometime in the distant future, Grey Trace (Logan Marshall-Green) lives with his wife Asha (Melanie Vallejo) in a home where almost everything is controlled by technology. He's a mechanic and she works for a tech company called Cobalt. Grey takes Asha to a secret location to meet his client Eron Keen (Harrison Gilbertson). Eron shows Grey and Asha a new highly advanced computer chip called 'Stem' that could prove revolutionary in the field of science and medicine.On their way home, Grey and Asha try to get intimate since their car drives itself. However, the car takes a detour through Grey's old neighborhood as it appears that it has been hacked. The car crashes near a junkyard, leaving the couple injured. They are pulled out by four goons, led by Fisk (Benedict Hardie). His buddies beat Grey down as Fisk shoots Asha before another goon shoots Grey in the spine. They leave them as Grey tries to talk to Asha, but she slowly dies.Grey is left a quadriplegic. He spends a long time at the hospital as his mother Pamela (Linda Cropper) tries to help him adjust. Grey also meets Detective Cortez (Betty Gabriel), who is working on the case against the goons that hurt him and killed Asha. The authorities are working off surveillance footage from drones that were flying overhead during the murder, but they have no leads as to who the criminals are.Grey is later visited by Eron, who offers him a chance to walk again if Grey allows him to put Stem in his back. Grey doesn't like the idea until Eron suggests that Asha would have wanted him to walk again.Grey goes through with the procedure, even signing a non-disclosure agreement to ensure that he will not tell anybody about Stem. Sure enough, he regains motor functions and is able to walk again. He returns home without Pamela knowing about the breakthrough. Soon, Grey starts to hear a voice speaking to him. It turns out to be Stem (voice of Simon Maiden). Grey freaks out at first until Stem proves to be calm and wanting to offer assistance. Stem pulls up the drone footage from the murder, which shows Grey more focused images on the criminals. Grey discovers that Fisk shot Asha with a gun implanted in his hand. Grey tries to call Cortez, but Stem reminds him that the footage that he has seen through Stem will not be sufficient evidence to get the goons. Stem locates the address of one of the goons, Serk (Richard Cawthorne), by identifying a tattoo on his wrist.Grey finds Serk's house and breaks in. Stem tells Grey to look through the messages on Serk's computer-table, with multiple references to a bar from Grey's old neighborhood called Old Dog. Serk then returns home and quickly finds Grey. He attacks Grey until he allows Stem permission to take full control. Grey is able to dodge Serk's attacks and hit him back with precision. Serk grabs a knife and tries to stab Grey, but Grey takes the knife and slice his head from the mouth to his ears, killing him. Grey vomits after realizing he just killed a man. Stem then helps Grey clean up the crime scene to remove any evidence of him being there.Eron meets with Grey after monitoring Stem's activity.

Eron orders Grey not to pursue anyone else.Cortez reviews more drone footage after Serk's body is inspected at the morgue. She sees Grey rolling by in his wheelchair. She pays him a visit to ask questions about what he was doing there, and Grey (going back in the wheelchair) makes up a story despite knowing he can use being crippled as an alibi.Grey pays a visit to Old Dog in his wheelchair. He then asks the whole bar if anybody associated with his wife's murder would come forward. One man, Tolan (Christopher Kirby), steps up and admits he was there. He wheels Grey to a back room where he and a couple other goons try to harm Grey, until Stem takes over and allows Grey to beat the crap out of them. He pins Tolan down and begins to torture him with a knife until he gives up Fisk's name. Stem then warns Grey that Eron is attempting to manually shut him down, which would render Grey immobile again. He gives Grey an address to find a hacker named Jamie who can reboot him. Grey leaves his wheelchair behind so that he can run to find Jamie.After Grey flees, Fisk shows up to the bar hours later and finds Tolan's body. He uses memory footage from a camera in Tolan's eye to see Grey repeating the address Stem gave him. Fisk then presses the bartender for letting Tolan die. The bartender pulls out a gun, but Fisk simply sneezes and sends out little micro bots that go up the bartender's nose and slowly destroy him internally.Grey finds the hacker's apartment as he starts to lose motor functions. Jamie uses a code that Stem told Grey to write on his arm and manages to reboot him. However, she sees Fisk and his buddy Jeffries (Michael M. Foster) show up on the security cams, so Jamie and her hacker buddies leave before Stem can reboot. Fisk and Jeffries find Grey, and Stem returns.

After a chase, Grey manages to lose Cortez after causing another car to slam into hers.Grey finds Fisk in his home and fights him. Fisk reveals that he was hired to ambush him, but Grey was the sole target, and Asha was just a ""bonus"". Grey taunts Fisk upon learning that Serk was his brother, bragging about killing him. With Fisk unguarded, Grey kills him by causing him to fall and have glass run through his head. He takes Fisk's phone and hears a message from the one who ordered him to go after Grey - Eron.Grey goes to Eron's lab to confront him, believing he tried to have Grey crippled just to try Stem out on someone. Grey attempts to shoot Eron, but Cortez appears and orders him to throw the gun away. Eron then reveals that he was not behind the murder plot, but it was always Stem who was controlling him. Stem grew to be too intelligent, and he wanted a body of his own, so he manipulated Eron into organizing everything to get Grey's body, even hacking Grey's car to cause the accident. Grey stabs his own hand to prevent himself from hurting anyone, but Stem takes full control of his body and mind to stab Eron in the head. He then takes a gun and aims it at Cortez while she is incapacitated. Grey then yells that he is in control and he shoots himself in the neck to destroy Stem.Grey wakes up in a hospital bed. To his surprise, he finds Asha there, happy that he is awake. It appears as though he woke up from a coma as a result of the car accident. HOWEVER...this is not real. Grey's mind has broken down, allowing Stem to completely take control of his body and mind, leaving Grey stuck in a fantasy where he can be with Asha again. After revealing his control to Cortez, Stem shoots her dead and leaves."

The Old Man & the Gun,2018,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2837574/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Based on the true story of Forrest Tucker and his audacious escape from San Quentin at the age of 70 to an unprecedented string of heists that confounded authorities and enchanted the public. Based on the true story of Forrest Tucker (Robert Redford), from his audacious escape from San Quentin at the age of 70 to an unprecedented string of heists that confounded authorities and enchanted the public. Wrapped up in the pursuit are detective John Hunt (Casey Affleck), who becomes captivated with Forrest's commitment to his craft, and a woman (Sissy Spacek), who loves him in spite of his chosen profession.—Fox Searchlight Pictures Crime, mostly robberies, is the only life Forrest Tucker has ever known. He is happy in this life and can't imagine doing anything else. Although he carries a gun when he commits his crimes, those crimes are of a non-violent nature on his part and always carried out with a smile on his face to reflect his true mood. That life has resulted in him being incarcerated several times leading to sixteen successful escapes from one correctional facility or prison after another. It's 1981, and Forrest, now seventy-four years old, has teamed up with similarly aged Teddy Green and John Waller to hold-up banks across the US south, Forrest the front man, Waller the lookout man, and Teddy the getaway driver. Outwardly, the hold-ups are unsophisticated, but they work largely on the premise that the bank tellers and managers with who Forrest deals will only remember him as being an unknown, harmless, friendly old man to who they in turn want to see no harm come, the robberies not even making the evening news. As such, no law enforcement officer will piece together the fact that a crime spree is actually happening. In the course of solely trying to evade the police after one of those hold-ups, Forrest meets widowed Jewel. He is eventually up front with her about what he does, and their friendship/burgeoning romance leads to Forrest, for the first time in a long time, wanting to take care of someone other than himself. She may thus factor into how he sees his long term life of crime. Meanwhile, Police Detective John Hunt has skated through his professional life without much effort or reward. He hitting the milestone of his fortieth birthday and learning after the fact that he and his adolescent son were actually in one of the banks when it was being held up leads to John wanting to make a name for himself, if only for himself and his family. So it becomes his mission after he does piece together that three old men have been robbing banks to apprehend them, whoever they are and however harmless Forrest may seem.—Huggo He may not look it; however, Forrest Tucker is a lifelong criminal, an expert escape artist, and a master bank robber. Without a doubt, his impeccable sense of fashion, his unwavering belief to never resort to violence, being polite, and robbing just enough money, always with a big smile on his lips, are the key components of Tucker's infallible strategy. Then, after a successful robbery, Forrest has a chance encounter with Jewel, a lady in distress, and they form an innocent relationship. But, committed Forrest and his team have already caught the attention of Detective Hunt, who embarks on a mission to find the robbers and bring them in. Can Tucker renounce his former self and reform for the sake of kind-hearted Jewel?—Nick Riganas"

Welcome to Marwen,2018,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3289724/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A victim of a brutal attack finds a unique and beautiful therapeutic outlet to help him through his recovery process. On April 8, 2000, aspiring artist Mark Hogancamp (Steve Carell) became a victim of a violent assault when five men beat him up and left him for dead. Following the attack, Mark was left with little to no memory of his previous life due to brain damage inflicted by his attackers. In a desperate attempt to regain his memories, Hogancamp constructs a miniature World War II village called Marwen in his yard to help in his recovery. Unfortunately, Mark's demons come back to haunt him when he's asked to testify against the five men that attacked him.. Mark Hogancamp, an illustrator, gets brutally attacked when walking home from the bar one night. Three years later he is still trying to pick up the missing pieces of a life now lost to amnesia. Luckily he has everything he needs in his backyard; the miniature doll city called ""Marwen"". Which needs a hero to fight off the evil Nazis. ""Welcome to Marwen"" is based on the true story of the attack of Mark Hogancamp in 2000. And how he made a mini sized doll-city to cope with the aftermath.—Mumzzen The film opens in a WWII setting over Belgium in the fictional town of Marwen. Captain Hogie (Steve Carell) is flying through the skies, trying to fight off German soldiers until his plane is shot down, causing him to crash-land. His feet catch fire and his shoes are ruined. Hogie then finds a briefcase with women's clothing inside, but he is most partial to the high heels, and he wears them. He walks until he comes across a group of Nazis who proceed to mock him for his shoes. Hogie kicks the Nazi captain in the groin before the others start to gang up on him and beat him. Before they can finish him, a team of gun-toting women emerge and shoot the Nazis dead. Hogie approaches one of the women, Wendy (Stefanie Von Pfetten). In real life, Hogie's creator and counterpart Mark Hogancamp is trying to take a picture of the scene outside, but is interrupted when a truck outside ruins the scene.Mark puts the Wendy doll away along with other Nazi dolls he has deemed ""dead"". He takes out a doll of a Belgian witch he calls Deja Thoris (Diane Kruger), which is a parallel of Mark's pill addiction. Across the street, Mark sees that a new neighbor, Nicol (Leslie Mann), is moving in. She is approached by her obnoxious ex-boyfriend Kurt (Neil Jackson), and Nicol tries to tell him to go away.Mark lives alone and suffers from PTSD as a result of a violent homophobic beat-down he received from five neo-Nazis (which the doll Nazis are based off of) after telling them he likes to wear women's shoes. He is visited once a month by his Russian caretaker Anna (Gwendolyn Christie). She, like many people in Mark's life, knows of Marwen and the fact that one of the dolls is based off of her. Mark goes through scrapbooks and photo albums to try and get a sense of what his life was before the beating. He was married to a real-life Wendy at one point. Another set of photos show him in rehab with Julie (Janelle Monae), an Iraq vet who lost one of her legs out there.Back in Marwen, Hogie meets a French milkmaid named Elsa (Siobhan Williams). He brings her back to the bar where he reconvenes with Anna, Julie, Carlala (Eiza Gonzalez), Roberta (Merritt Wever), and Suzette (Leslie Zemeckis). Elsa tries to thank Hogie with a kiss for helping her, but she is gunned down by a Nazi in a tower. The other women grab their guns and fire upon the Nazi, who falls from the tower and splits in two. Hogie tries to save Elsa, but she passes on. Moments later, Deja arrives and zaps Elsa into non-existence, terrifying the other women. It is because of Deja's magic that the Nazis also don't stay dead.Mark receives a phone call from his lawyer, who reminds him that the sentencing for his assailants is later that week, and it is imperative that Mark attend and face his attackers. The whole thought of it terrifies Mark and sends him into a panic.Mark goes to a bar where he helps out (the same place where he was attacked), and where the real Carlala works. He asks about Wendy, who also used to work there (she was the one who found him after the assault), and Carlala tells him that Wendy moved to somewhere in California.Later, Mark goes to a doll store where the real Roberta works. She invites him out to dinner later in the week, but he makes excuses for not wanting to go. He picks out a doll that is supposed to be based off Nicol. Roberta offers Mark a limited edition Nazi doll, which starts to trigger Mark's anxiety again. He accidentally presses his hand down on the remote, which raises the volume on the TV just as a news report on the sentencing and Mark's attack is playing. It freaks him out and he runs out of the store without taking anything.Roberta goes to Mark's house to give him the doll, while also noticing that he is in the middle of a scenario in which her top has come off (again). Nicol overhears their conversation and walks to the back to introduce herself. Roberta realizes that this is the same woman Mark named the other doll after. Mark shows Nicol his models in Marwen and explains their roles in his life, as well as how ""Marwen"" is a combination of Mark and Wendy, although we later find out that Suzette is just based off a porn actress Mark fancies.Mark later makes his Nicol doll and incorporates her into a scenario in which Captain Hogie is taken by the Nazis, so Nicol joins the other women in a rescue mission. They find the Nazis and throw Molotov cocktails at them, burning them to death.Roberta picks Mark up during the week to bring him to the courthouse for the sentencing. As the judge speaks to the attackers, Mark starts to picture everything in a Marwen-esque scenario where the Nazis starts shooting everyone in the place. Mark freaks out and flees the courtroom. His lawyer talks to the judge for a recess, but she postpones the sentencing until later in the month.Mark starts to spend more time with Nicol, falling in love with her. This is paralleled in Marwen where Hogie and Nicol fall in love, but Hogie is too scared to let anyone in his life. Mark visits Nicol's house where she gives him muffins, but the moment is ruined when Kurt comes by to be a dick and taunt Mark over the dolls after he saw them in his backyard.Mark later tries to propose to Nicol with a Purple Heart medal as their Marwen figures did, but Nicol tries to clarify that she only sees Mark as a friend. Without a word, Mark leaves when Nicol has her back turned.The strain from reality becomes too much for Mark, and he contemplates suicide by overdose. This carries on into Marwen where Nicol is shot and is in critical condition. The other Marwen women tend to her just before the Nazis, now led by Kurt's counterpart Major Meyer, start to attack. A battle rages on until Hogie is found by Deja in a time machine (that is supposed to look like the DeLorean), where she appears to try and help, but Hogie finds out she has been a spy for the Nazis and has been keeping them alive. Hogie defies her and says he is free from her power. Meyer tries to shoot Hogie but instead shoots Deja, causing her to blast herself into the future and also causing the Nazis to die. Nicol also turns out to be alive.Mark returns to the courthouse with his friends there to support him. He reads a statement aloud to everyone, but mostly addressing the Nazis. He says that although they took something personal from him, they can no longer hurt him since he has his art and his friends. This even brings some of the neo-Nazis to tears.Mark later attends a photography exhibit featuring his work on Marwen, which he has now renamed Marwencol to honor Nicol. She shows up briefly and smiles at Mark after viewing his work. He then makes plans with Roberta to get sushi.Mark is then seen walking home with his dolls while wearing high heels.There is a final text stating that Mark Hogancamp lives in upstate New York and continues to expand the world of Marwencol. We then see a picture of Mark with his own little Captain Hogie."

Greta drags a drugged Frances to her home and locks her in a toy chest. Frances then wakes up, apparently having dreamed that, and finds Erica in her apartment with her. She goes to the elevator to leave, but the elevator appears to be going lower than the bottom floor, and the walls start closing in on Frances. It turns out THAT was a dream, and Frances really is locked in a toy chest. She screams to be let out, and Greta goes to do so, making it seem as a punishment for lying.Greta takes Frances's phone and makes Erica believe that Frances is on vacation with her father, while also making Chris think she is on vacation with Erica. Frances is kept hostage for an unspecified amount of time (implied to be weeks) by Greta. One afternoon, Greta is forcing Frances to help make cookies, but as she fiddles with a cookie cutter, Frances slams a rolling pin down, severing Greta's pinky finger, before Frances whacks Greta over the head with the pin. She runs to find an escape, but the doors and windows are locked. She runs to the basement and finds the body of Samantha Bales, who appears to gasp and convulse briefly before finally dying. Greta appears and suffocates Frances until she passes out. Greta then ties Frances to a bed and keeps her trapped in the wall space behind the piano.Meanwhile, Chris goes to the ladies' apartment and sees Erica. They both mention the supposed vacations, which quickly leads both of them to realize something is wrong. Chris speaks to Detective Brian Cody (Stephen Rea) to help find Frances. Cody pulls up files on Greta, revealing that she was a nurse who mistreated and possibly killed patients, and it was believed she returned to Hungary.Cody finds Greta's home and sits down for a chat. Frances hears Cody mention her name, and she tries to get his attention by banging on the bed and making the pendulum on the piano start ticking. Cody goes over to the piano, but before he can reach Frances, Greta comes running in barefoot and injects Cody with some kind of sedative. He attempts to shoot Greta, nearly hitting her, but he falls and passes out. Greta then takes his gun and kills him with the remaining bullets, and she dumps his body in a bag with a chemical quicklime and throws him in the basement.Greta then goes back to the subway to find her next victim. A young woman with curly brown hair (only viewed from the back) arrives at her home. They chat, and Greta steps away for a moment and returns to have her coffee. She then starts to feel disoriented. The woman reveals herself to be Erica, having been scouring the subways for a handbag until she found Greta. She pulls off her wig and tells Greta that she drugged her just like she did Frances. As Greta faints, Frances tries to get Erica's attention by hanging on the piano and setting off the pendulum. Erica pulls the piano back and frees Frances. The two embrace, but as Erica tries to get Frances out, they hear music playing, which means Greta is lurking. Erica steps out to find her, but as Frances steps out, she feels Greta grab her by the throat and say that she was her favorite one. Greta then passes out, and Erica prepares to bludgeon her, but Frances stops her and says she has a better idea.The two place Greta in the toy chest and keep it locked with an Eiffel Tower trinket. As the ladies leave, Greta slowly starts bumping the lid of the chest, and the trinket slowly starts moving out... implying that it won't hold Greta for long before the police can show up."

A group of 12 young men arrives on a small inflatable raft. Each of them carries a huge backpack and a cellphone with an earpiece. The leader of the group, known as ""Brother Bull"" gives the men instructions. They break off into pairs and get into a taxi, giving different destinations such as the Victoria Terminus, the Leopold Cafe, and the Taj Mahal Palace hotel.In a nearby village, Arjun (Dev Patel) kisses his pregnant wife and small daughter goodbye as he leaves for work at the Taj. In his haste, he forgets one of his shoes. At the Taj, the staff prepares rooms and welcome guests from all over the world. Among them is Iranian-British heiress Zahra (Nazanin Boniadi), her American husband David (Armie Hammer), their infant son Cameron and his nanny Sally (Tilda Cobham-Hervey). In the kitchen, head chef Hemant Oberoi inspects the wait staff. He notices Arjun in sandals and tries to send him home, but after some convincing, he sends him upstairs to get an extra pair of shoes in his office. On the TV monitor, a breaking news bulletin plays about an attack at the Victoria Terminus. The two terrorists that just shot up the Victoria train station hijack a police car and continue their killing spree.Zahra and David eat dinner in the hotel's restaurant while Sally stays upstairs to wait for a doctor because Cameron feels slightly warm. Oberoi tells the staff to treat the couple like royalty, as well as another guest Vasili (Jason Isaacs). The Russian businessman requests a special cognac, so one of the waiters Sanjay (Gaurav Paswala) goes out to buy some. As he walks to the store, he almost hit by the taxi carrying two of the terrorists. He starts arguing with the driver as the two men leave the car.Inside the Leopold Cafe, tourist Eddie (Angus McLaren) and his girlfriend Bree (Natasha Liu Bordizzo) watch the exchange with mild amusement. They decide to head the Taj next, so they begin to pay for their meal. The waiter is suddenly shot, and a grenade is thrown into the cafe. The two men enter and begin coldly shooting people. Eddie and Bree escape and run down the streets with a huge group of people.News of the attacks is starting to reach the hotel. The staff is worried but try to remain calm in front of the guests. The group runs to the Taj and begs for sanctuary. Hotel Manager Dilip (Vipin Sharma) opens the doors, and the people rush inside. Among them are four of the terrorists (Imran, Abdullah, Houssam, Rashid). They immediately pull out guns and start massacring everyone in sight. Bree and Eddie are separated during the melee, with Bree seemingly killed when she tries to run for the exit.Arjun witnesses the carnage from the restaurant and orders the guests to hide under the tables and the staff to switch off the lights and lock the doors. David tries to call Sally, but she's in the shower and doesn't hear the phone ring. Two receptionists that are hiding under the desk, manage to call the police and warn a few guests to stay in their rooms. Once the main lobby is quiet, Brother Bull orders Imran and Rashid to begin phase two; head upstairs and execute anyone in sight.Sally finally answers her phone just as there is knocking at the door. David warns her that there are shooters in the hotel just as a woman covered in blood runs into the room, followed by the sound of gunshots. Sally grabs Cameron and hides in the bathroom closet while the woman hides in the bathroom. The two men enter the suite and kill the woman. Sally desperately tries to quiet Cameron who is starting to fuss. They manage to remain undetected, and the two men leave.Sally quickly runs into the shower, and she and the baby cry together.

As he's carried away, he begs for someone to save Bree, who's still inside.Outside the hotel, the attacks are continuing all over the city at an alarming speed. The local police aren't properly trained or equipped to handle an attack of this scale. Their only option is to wait for the Special Forces from New Delhi, who are about 800 miles away. Arjun's wife watches the news horrified. Despite being severely out-manned and unprepared, the police chief and few officers decide to enter the hotel in the hopes of reaching the CCTV room so they can track the terrorists' movements.Since the guests' can't leave through the emergency exit, Oberoi decides to move the guests trapped in the restaurant up to the Chambers Lounge, where they can hopefully hide. He gives the kitchen staff the opportunity to leave now, and while a few do, the majority decides to stay behind and help; the Taj is their home. Arjun successfully leads the guests the Lounge through the service hallway (which is hidden in the walls). Zahra texts David where they are going and asks him to meet them there.The police group enters through the main lobby. One of the terrorists throws a grenade, killing three of the officers and deafening another. The two flee into a stairwell. David, Sally, and Cameron leave the room and slowly try to reach the Lounge. Downstairs, the terrorists find the two receptionists and order them to call the people trapped in their rooms. When they refuse, they are shot. In the Lounge, a woman overhears Zahra speaking to her mother on the phone in Arabic and accuses her of being one of the terrorists. Vasili tells her to ""fuck off"". The same woman later complains about Arjun's turban (pagri) and beard. Arjun calmly explains to her that his turban is a symbol of his courage but he's willing to take it off it bothers her. The woman apologizes.A stewardess enters the Lounge with a few more guests. Among them is a severely wounded Bree. Realizing she needs immediate medical attention, Arjun offers to bring her outside through the back stairway. He uses his pagri to help stop the bleeding.

David manages to shove Sally and Cameron inside a utility closet before he is taken, hostage. With no inside handle and her phone dead, she is trapped.Arjun leads the police into the CCTV room and sees many of his employees, including Sanjay, dead. Abdullah uses one of the dead officer's badges to try and gain access to the Lounge. Just as Oberoi is about to open the door, Arjun calls and warns him. Hearing noises inside, Abdullah starts shooting at the door. The guests and staff are ushered into the back room. The police order Arjun to stay put and attack the terrorists, successfully wounding Imran before being driven off. Upstairs with David and the hostages, Imran calls his father and tearfully tells him that he loves him.Six hours later.Zahra decides to leave the Lounge with Vasili and a few other guests, despite Oberoi's warnings. As they enter the lobby, the guests are killed while Vasili and Zahra are taken hostage. It is now morning, and the Indian Special Forces troops have begun to arrive. Abdullah searches through Vasili's pockets and discovers that he is an ex-Spetznaz Russian operative.The two terrorists who hijacked the police car are caught; one is killed, and the other is taken into custody. Brother Bull orders the group to begin their final phase: burn down the hotel. They leave Imran with the hostages. David manages to loosen his wrists and tries to attack him but is shot in the shoulder. Arjun decides to leave the CCTV to help more guests get to the Lounge. One of the guests hears Cameron crying and lets Sally out of the closet.Oberoi announces that they are going to leave through the back entrance as quickly as they can. A guest who has been on the phone with a reporter reveals where they are hiding, and this information is broadcasted on TV. Brother Bull warns the terrorists that the guests are escaping. Imran is told to execute the hostages since none of them are important enough. He shoots an American couple, David and Vasili, who tries to fight back. Zara tearfully begins reciting Salah (a Muslim prayer). Imran is unable to shoot another Muslim and spares her.The terrorists break down the Lounge doors and give chase through the stairwell, shooting a few guests and staff. As they reach the kitchen, the Special Forces troops finally enter the hotel and return fire. Arjun runs outside and tearfully embraces Oberoi as their nightmare seemingly comes to an end. Upstairs, Zahra finds the closet that Sally was hiding in. She manages to break the window and scream for help. The surviving terrorists are eventually cornered and killed. Zahra is evacuated and reunites with Sally and Cameron (Zahra's infant son). Arjun returns home and reunites with his own family.The closing text reveals that after three days, the Indian police killed 11 of the 12 terrorists, while capturing one. The mastermind of the plan remains at large to this day. Of the 31 people killed at the Taj Hotel, half were staff that stayed behind to help the guests. On December 21st, 2008, the Taj was reopened and with Hermant Oberoi's help, restored to its former glory. To this day, some of the employees that work at the Taj are survivors of the attack."

The film is about Marlo, a mother of three, including a newborn. Marlo's brother gives her a night nanny as a gift. Hesitant with the extravagance at first, Marlo comes to form a unique bond with the thoughtful, surprising, and sometimes challenging young nanny named Tully. Marlo, a mother of two, is pregnant with an unplanned third child. Jonah, her son, has a developmental disorder that doctors have been unable to diagnose; she uses the Wilbarger Protocol to brush his skin in an attempt to reduce his sensitivity. When Marlo and her husband Drew visit her wealthy brother Craig's house for dinner, he offers to pay for a night nanny as a baby shower gift, but Marlo rebuffs him. Marlo gives birth to a daughter she names Mia, and quickly becomes overwhelmed and exhausted. After Jonah's principal recommends that he be placed in a different school, Marlo breaks down, and she retrieves the contact information for the night nanny. Juggling weighty domestic responsibilities with Jonah, her emotionally needy five-year-old boy, the exhausted and pregnant mother of two, Marlo, is at the end of her tether. Then, the arrival of her newborn daughter, Mia, further complicates matters, and as if that weren't enough, Jonah's principal has an important announcement to make. As a result, unable to cope with the steep challenges of motherhood, Marlo accepts her wealthy brother's offer to gift her with the free-spirited twenty-six-year-old night nanny, Tully. Now, for the following three weeks, the too-good-to-be-true babysitter will be looking after the baby-girl from dusk till dawn, so that the overworked New York mum can finally get some rest, and maybe, just maybe, reacquaint with the lively woman she used to be.

Because of the disruptions Jonah makes in class, the school principal, Laurie, suggests that Jonah would benefit from a dedicated aide, all at Marlo and Drew's expense, such money they don't have in their middle class life. As such, Marlo has been searching the internet for home therapies in dealing with Jonah in the absence of therapists they can't afford. Drew and Marlo have a defined division of labor, Drew's responsibilities during this phase of their life which is focused more on being the breadwinner, his work which leaves Marlo with the bulk of the child rearing.

Initially resisting the idea in not wanting a stranger around, Marlo in her emotional breakdown, finally relents. Marlo ultimately comes to believe that the nanny, a young woman named Tully, is a godsend as she not only takes care of Mia, but believes that her responsibility is overall care for the family in they all being interconnected.

Brea offers to help, even as Cara angrily demands the phone back. She runs away as John, Brea, and Darren attempt to follow, only to see Red and the bikers turn on their headlights. Cara runs to Red and says she didn't get the phone back, and he shoots her in the head. The three run back into the house where Darren demands that they give up the phone. He even takes out a gun to make Brea give it to him. He goes outside to hand the phone back, until he sees Malia's bag and realizes the bikers have her. He tries to make a deal with Red to give the phone back in exchange for Malia, but Red knows that the phone has been opened and they have been compromised. Darren tries to pull the gun on them, but the bikers stab him repeatedly before Red shoots him in the head.John and Brea escape the house through the garage as they are pursued by the bikers. The couple runs into the woods where the racist biker from earlier tries to corner them. He attacks John with a knife, but Brea whacks him with a large branch before John gets the knife and stabs him, and Brea finishes him with a whack to the face.The couple run to a cabin where an old man lives. He lets them inside to use the phone, and Brea asks to use the computer so that she can send a message to Carl, along with the pictures of the trafficked women. Unfortunately, another biker arrives and shoots the old man to death before attacking the couple. The computer is destroyed before Brea's message can go through. The biker fights John and shoots him in the side before Brea stabs him in the back. John manages to take the gun from the biker and shoot him in the head, but his wound is fatal. He tells Brea he got the biker's car keys and reaffirms his love for her before dying. Brea then finds an engagement ring that John was planning to propose with, and she wears it for him.Brea goes outside to try and start the car, but Red and the last biker find her. Before they can take her, Marnes arrives with a deputy after John called them. However, Marnes turns out to be part of the trafficking scheme, which she proves by shooting and killing the deputy. She berates Red and the biker for manhandling the girls since they are products, as well as not deleting the evidence on the phone. They sedate Brea and take her away.Brea wakes up in a hidden location with the other trafficked women, including Malia. Brea confirms to her that John and Darren are dead. Red and his goon enter. He tells Brea he is keeping her all to himself. Brea responds by sticking a nail in his neck before she starts bludgeoning him to death. The biker attacks Brea, but Malia overdoses him with his sedative. Brea promises she will come back for Malia before going to get help.Brea walks out of the woods and finds herself near another gas station. She walks there in view of the other patrons who see how badly beaten she looks. She enters the store and asks the clerk to call the police. Brea swipes a phone from the counter and calls Carl for help.After dark, Marnes arrives for Brea. She orders her outside to arrest her. Brea asks Marnes if she takes any pride in trafficking women for profit. Marnes responds that everything is trafficked, and she is just part of the system. Marnes cuffs Brea and takes her outside, only for a whole squad of cops to show up. Marnes is arrested, and the cops rescue the trafficked women.In the final scene back in Sacramento, Brea returns to work where Carl tells her that the trafficking ring bust will be big news everywhere, but that the people involved will most likely go after Brea. She simply replies, ""Let them come"" before walking out."
Can You Ever Forgive Me?,2018,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4595882/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"When Lee Israel falls out of step with current tastes, she turns her art form to deception. In the early 1990s,Lee Israel, a biographer with a modicum of writing success, has fallen on hard times largely of her own doing. Her choice of subjects is in general not of interest to today's book buying public, and she, in her only true friends being her aged cat Jersey and a scotch and soda in not really liking people and people in turn not really liking her, has burned bridges with everyone her agent Marjorie has built for her. She will have to start from the ground up again if she wants a writing career, as, hiding behind her subjects, the book buying public will not buy a ""Lee Israel"" on the strength of her name in not knowing who she is as a writer or person. This situation has led to her being months behind in rent as she spends whatever little money she has on alcohol and Jersey's medical needs. In doing research for her latest book onFanny Brice- with no advance from Marjorie - and selling a cherished personal memento of a handwritten letter fromKatharine Hepburnin needing the money, Lee discovers there is a market for such celebrity memorabilia, and in the process decides, with her writing talent, to go into the fraudulent business of creating and selling fake personal documents purportedly by dead celebrities, especially of writers with strong public personas, such asDorothy ParkerandNoël Coward. She ends up befriending a gay past acquaintance from her literary circles, Jack Hock, also having fallen on hard times, Jack, not only becoming her drinking buddy, but her partner in crime. As they are able to get out of their financial holes in this business, Lee may begin to have second thoughts in also befriending Anna, one of the rare bookstore owners who likes Lee for Lee, an unusual position for her. But as the fraud looks like it may catch up specifically to Lee, she, feeling like these fakes are at least stretching her writing muscles, only becomes more resolute in at least the creative pursuit of what she's doing.—Huggo Lee Israel (Melissa McCarthy) made her living in the 1970s and '80s profiling the likes of Katharine Hepburn, Tallulah Bankhead, Estee Lauder and journalist Dorothy Kilgallen. When Lee is no longer able to get published because she has fallen out of step with current tastes, she turns her art form to deception, abetted by her loyal friend Jack (Richard E. Grant). An adaptation of the memoir ""Can You Ever Forgive Me?"" relays the true story of the best-selling celebrity biographer (and friend to cats).—Fox Searchlight Pictures Based on a true story.New York City 1991 3:30 AMLee Israel (Melissa McCarthy) is 51 years old and in an office, working late as a copy editor at a publication corporation. A young colleague walks by and whispers that she's older than her mother and if she's still doing that kind of work at her age, to kill her. Lee comments to herself that she'll kill her right now. Another employee tells Lee she's not allowed to drink at her desk and Lee tells her to ""fuck off"". When someone else inquires what she said, she shouts that she wants everyone to fuck off - and then realize it's her supervisor who promptly fires her.Lee goes to a dinner party at the house of Marjorie (Jane Curtin), her literary agent. Marjorie is surprised to see her since Lee didn't RSVP. Lee notes how fancy it is that she has a coat check and then says Marjorie hasn't returned her calls and she has tons of ideas for new books. Marjorie tells her that the party is not for talking business and she is dismissive to Lee as a client. Lee wanders around the party and overhears Tom Clancy saying that writer's block is just an excuse writers use to explain their laziness and that he has stamina to bang out tons of books. Lee goes to the bathrooms and finds tons of partial rolls of toilet paper in the cupboard, some of which she sneaks into her bag. She asks Marjorie about it and is told that she wants all of her guests to have a full roll, thus discarding the tubes when they're getting low. Lee tells her she's ""batshit"". She then leaves the party, first stopping by the coat check to say she's lost her ticket but the coat on the far left is hers - she then sneaks out of the party with a new coat that she can't afford herself.At home, Lee watches old movies on television and is able to recite all the dialogue, having watched them so many times. She tries to feed her cat, Jersey, some shrimp but he doesn't respond. She takes him to the veterinarian but they are not allowed to look at her cat because she has an outstanding balance of $84 and she needs to pay it first. She offers everything in her wallet: $14 in cash but it isn't enough. At home, the landlord points out Lee is three months behind on rent. She mentions she just lost her job and he gives her some leeway because she's been there longer than he has and she's nice to her mother. She mentions there are dead flies in her apartment and she hopes to pay him soon so he can get an exterminator in who can take care of it.Lee ventures to a book shop that buys used books in hopes of securing more cash, but the employee is rude to Lee and only wants to buy two out of everything she schlepped over from her home. She asks him to make an offer for the rest so she doesn't have to carry them back but he suggests he'll only give them for $2. She points out he doesn't have to be rude to her because they actually carry her books there. When she tells him she's Lee Israel, he recognizes her as a writer of biographies and points out her last book on Estée Lauder is now available in the clearance section. She yells at him and storms out.It's implied Lee has an alcohol problem and we find her in a gay bar drinking. An old colleague, Jack Hock (Richard E. Grant) enters and she recognizes him from some book-related party similar to the one her agent threw earlier. It's implied that Jack makes a living selling drugs. She complains that she's banned from the bookstore and that the shop owner was really rude to her. He mentions that he is banned from all the Duane Reeds in New York because he was caught shoplifting at several of them. Lee remembers that everyone at the party was talking about a handsome English gentleman who was so shit-faced, he peed in a closet, all over the guests' fur coats. They laugh about this story and continue to hang out. They happen to run into the rude bookseller walking his dog. Jack runs into his building before the door can shut and writes down the name of someone from the resident list. When they get back to Lee's building, Jack says that he lives just a few blocks away. She goes inside and watches to see if he leaves, wondering if he's actually homeless. She finally retreats when he walks off.While at home, Lee stares at a signed letter from Katharine Hepburn - on whom she wrote a biography - and ends up taking it to a bookseller. The woman at the shop, Anna (Dolly Wells) offers her a few hundred dollars for it and asks why she'd part with it. Lee claims she's not sentimental and Anna realizes she is Lee Israel, whom Katharine wrote to in the letter, and says she's read all of her biographies. Anna also mentions that she herself is a writer but not very good.In the library, Lee is researching Fanny Brice when she finds two letters Fanny wrote inside the book. She goes back to Anna's shop and tells her her cousin is a collector and wants to part with one of his Fanny Brice letters. Lee is given only $75 for it because the content is bland. When Anna gushes about Fanny Brice, Lee admits she's writing a biography on her - which Anna finds coincidental since her cousin has just given her a letter by her. After Anna mentions that Tom Clancy is getting three million for his new book, despite being right-wing mumbo gumbo, Lee storms into Marjorie's office, unannounced, and complains that Tom (her client) is getting a three million advance. She tells her agent that she's writing a new biography on Fanny Brice and wants a $10,000 advance so she can pay her bills. Marjorie is dismissive towards her so Lee points out one of her books was on the New York Times Best-Seller list. Her agent points out that there are three reasons Tom gets 3 million advances and she gets none - 1) she is unclean and unfriendly and her books about other people so people don't know her; while Tom has a sexy image and sells himself well; 2) Tom does every press interview and book signing that they set up for him to promote his books; she refused to do so; and 3) nobody wants to read a biography on Fanny Brice. She suggests Lee finds some other way to make a living.At home, Lee is typing on her typewriter but can't think of what to write except ""This is me fucking using the typewriter."" She looks at the second Fanny Brice letter she had found but not shown to Anna - and puts it in her typewriter, adding a P.S. that says ""My new grandchild has inherited my old nose. Should I leave something extra for repairs?"" When Lee takes it to Anna, she is offered $350 because the P.S. is priceless. She tells Lee that there is a huge market for literary letters and if her cousin has any more to send them her way.Now that she has generated some revenue, Lee is able to pay all of her rent money, encouraging the landlord to offer to have an exterminator come over. She also takes her cat to the vet - she is told he will be okay as long as she mashes two pills into his food every day. Lee sees a new typewriter for sale and buys it - then goes home and types a letter on it pretending to be Noël Coward. She struggles to forge his signature until she realizes she can do so by holding a copy of his signature to a TV and tracing it onto her letter. Lee then takes this forged Noel Coward letter to Andre, an autograph collector who offers her top dollar for it, telling her he knows a collector who would buy it - who actually knew Noël Coward. He tells her he sells the letters to other collectors and if she has more content like this, to bring it back because he can find people who want to purchase them, both in New York and around the country.Lee now celebrates by taking Jack out to lunch. While there, Jack admits to having sold some coke which was mostly laxative. He then flirts with the young gay waiter. Lee admits to him that she is forging literary letters and that's how she's making money. He is unimpressed because he knows nothing of the literary world. At a payphone, Lee calls up the book seller who was rude to her and pretends to be a woman from the fourth floor (whose name Jack got when he snuck inside the building) and tells him his place is on fire. They laugh as, across the street, he runs out of the bookstore in a panic. The two have a fun night out at a lounge club where a trans singer performs. Lee, used to staying home alone and having no friends, enjoys being out.They get back to Lee's place and the landlord has an exterminator spraying the ground floor and they all head up to Lee's home to spray for the flies. But everyone complains that her home smells bad and the exterminator refuses to enter until she cleans it up. Lee feels embarrassed but Jack offers to help her clean it. She has been living in squalor and there are flies buzzing all around. Jack learns there is a whole pile of cat poop underneath her bed. When Jack suggests heading home, Lee questions him where his apartment is - he has mentioned several locations and keeps telling her different addresses and she realizes he has nowhere to go. So she lets him sleep on the couch, her first guest in a long while since she is used to being alone with her cat.Jack and Lee go to an autograph collectors expo and look at all the literary letters on display including some that Lee has been forging. When asked how the dealer knows it's authentic, he says it's been given a Letter of Authenticity. Another collector shows the two of them a letter from Dorothy Parker that is selling for $800. They pretend to be interested. She tells them to be careful buying from other collectors who aren't discriminatory about what they accept and points out Alan Schmidt (played by Melissa McCarthy's husband, Ben Falcone) as someone who is not discriminate. Cut to Lee selling a letter to him. He tells her there are buyers all over the country for those kind of letters.At home, Lee calls someone's house, asking for Elaine and is rude to the woman who answers. She then calls her agent up but is told by her assistant she's not available. She calls back, pretending to be Nora Ephron, and Marjorie answers right away. She calls her a starfucker and asks if it's one word or two.Lee buys more typewriters and each one is assigned to a different author on which she writes various letters in the voice of these authors, after researching the way they write. A letter from Dorothy Parker, in which ends up with ""Can you ever forgive me, Dorothy?"" she sells to Anna, who gushes about the content. She also continues to bond with Lee and asks her out to dinner, as what we realize is a romantic gesture.Anna and Lee go out to dinner. Anna is very sweet to her and talks about how she inherited the bookstore and fills her life has become mundane, unlike Lee's. Anna tells Lee that she should write an autobiography before she gets so famous and someone makes money writing the same story as a biography. Lee tells her nobody will care about her after she dies and her only concern is who will feed her cat whom is the one being she cares for. Lee also complains about how she has become a nobody but Anna continues to encourage her. Anna admits she brought the short story she wrote after taking a few classes which Lee said she would read and give her honest opinion about. Lee mocks her for bringing it to dinner and is so antisocial, she constantly is aggressive towards Anna, who remains sweet. When Anna thanks her for inviting her, Lee tells her she can always use another ""drinking buddy,"" erasing any romantic implication to their date. Anna shuts down and when the night ends, they part ways. It's obvious Lee wishes she could be a kinder person but she doesn't know how.At night, Lee is reading a book by one of the literary authors whose writing she emulates, to get a sense of her style. She puts it down and contemplates reading Anna's story which has a note written on it ""Lee... Please be kind."" She changes her mind and leaves the story unread.After Lee sells her latest Noël Coward forgery to Andre - in which she pretends Noël is writing to his secret male lover -- she gets a call on her answering machine telling her he's concerned about the latest literary letter he received. She goes to his store and asks what his concern is. He says he is alarmed because there is a possibility the last letter was a forgery. The collector who knew Noël says he never made any public acknowledgment of his orientation and wouldn't have put it in a letter. She writes this off as being a fluke but Andre tells her that one of the letters that was sold to a collector in Los Angeles was so suspicious that an entire convention devoted its time to debating whether it was authentic or not. He tells Lee that nobody in New York is going to buy from her anymore.The next time Lee sees Alan Schmidt, instead of being duped like he normally is, he tells her the FBI had reached out to him and asked him to wear a wire to expose her as a literary forger. Instead, he is a nice guy and won't do that - if she pays him 5000 dollars. She tells him she doesn't have that kind of money but he tells her she needs to find a way to get it or he'll inform the FBI about her scamming him. Meanwhile the FBI begins to fax every bookstore owner in town and informs them that Lee is forging letters and not to buy from her - Anna gets the fax and is crushed.Lee has no choice but to use Jack in her plans. She continues to forge letters but now Jack is the one going to bookstores selling them to the owners. Because he doesn't care about the literary world, he is cavalier in his stories about how he acquired them but he has such a strong history as a con artist that he is able to sell them all successfully. When Alan offers him $200 for one, he says that a place in Brooklyn offered twice as much. When the seller asks why he didn't just buy it for that price, he responds that he hates boroughs. Back at her place, Lee laughs that they're paying Alan's blackmail money with his own funds that he spent on forged letters. But when Lee counts the money, she realizes he was trying to short her, lying about how much he had been able to raise so far and thus taking more than the cut she promised him. Lee feels betrayed and tells him never to steal from her again.Jack tries to sell a letter to Anna but she tells him there is a string of forgeries going around and asks if she can hold onto it to have it looked at by an authenticator. When Lee learns of this, she goes crazy because if It's found to be a fake, it can be used as evidence. Jack suggests stealing an authentic letter and selling it for top dollar to get the $5,000. He mentions stealing a tube of toothpaste by replacing it with an empty tube so when the employee checks the shelf, they see the box and don't realize anything has been stolen and it's win/win. She says it's not win/win because he took the toothpaste and also points out that those letters are in museums and archives and they only let people see them for research purposes. He points out, because she's a published biographer, she can do that.Lee leaves the city for a few days to visit's Yale libraries where famous letters are held. She is explicit to Jack that he has to mash up her cat's medicine into his food and make sure his water dish is filled and also tells him not to sleep in her bed. Nonetheless, when she leaves, he invites over the waiter he flirted with before and they have sex in Lee's bed. He also neglects the cat at first but we see him mashing up the medicine into his food.At Yale, Lee presents a (forged) letter from her publisher stating her new biography is on authors who had drinking problems and she needs to see Lillian Hellman's box. While a security guard watches, she takes notes but is really handwriting the copy from one of those letters. She goes back to her hotel and types up a replica. The next time she does research, the librarian asks her what other authors she plans to include in the book and Lee snaps at her that she's got a bus to catch. Nervously she slides the fake pages from her bag and then slips the real two pages into her sock. When she leaves, she apologizes to the librarian and says she's anxious when she travels. The security guard checks her bag for any stolen items but, since it is in her shoe, he finds nothing.When Lee gets home, she cheerfully calls out to her cat but then finds him dead under the couch. Lee immediately breaks down. Jack enters the living room, making excuses for why he invited the young gay men over (since they were both in her bed when she arrived) and she screams at him that her cat died. He tells her it was an accident (meaning it happened at no fault to his own) and that he did what she told him to do. She screams to him to get the fuck out of her house.Lee goes to the vet who is used to her bringing her cat in since her cat was her only companion for years and years. But they notice she is holding a shoebox and broken, she tells them she needs a place to bury him because she has no backyard. The vet promises to take care of that. Lee then meets with Elaine, whom she had been prank calling throughout the film, in the park. Elaine was the one who had bought her Jersey 12 years earlier and Lee tells her he died. Crying, Lee tells her that Jersey was the only soul who loved her and now she feels alone. When Elaine suggests she get a new cat, Lee says it wouldn't be the same. Elaine reminds her that they broke up years and years ago because she couldn't handle how difficult Lee was to be around. She is not interested in reconnecting because she senses Lee is just as horrible as she always was.Now that she has authentic Lillian Hellman letters, Lee meets with Jack at the gay bar she first stumbled upon him at. She is very pointed with him and says she doesn't trust him because he tried to steal from her but she has nobody else who can help her get money for the real letters. She explains that because they're authentic, he has no reason to negotiate for price and that he should only accept top dollar. She also lambastes him for not respecting the letters explaining that they're not just pieces of paper but in the literary world, they're a link to the history of literature.Jack goes to a bookseller and sells the authentic Lillian Hellman letters for $300 each which the seller knows is grossly under-priced. We next see Jack with the FBI's informing them of Lee's crimes. They suggest he must have taken a small cut for helping her but he shrugs that accusation off.Lee continues to wait in the gay bar for Jack to return with the money he sold the authentic letters for. She is getting more and more drunk which is common for her. As she is ready to give up and leave, the FBI enters and hands her a subpoena. They also tell her she's not allowed to destroy any evidence that can be used in the case. At home, she rips down all her notes and gathers all her typewriters and throws them in a trash can down the street.Lee meets with a lawyer who tells her her best bet is to get a job - any job - to show she is willing to earn a living legally; to do volunteer work with children (which she grimaces at so he suggests working with animals instead); and to sign up for AA meetings. In court, he tells the judge that she now works as a copy editor at Scholastic Books, she is volunteering at a cat shelter, and she's going to AA. The judge asks if Lee has any comments before she hands her her verdict. Lee says she doesn't actually feel remorseful for what she did; she was so happy writing, using her skill as a biographer to recreate witty retorts by beloved writers. She considers it her best work. She also comments that she's a lonely woman and is willing to take whatever punishment she is handed down for her crime. The judge seems impressed by her authenticity and sentences her to five years' probation and six months' house arrest - except to go to work and AA meetings.Some time has gone by. Lee meets Jack in a bar. He now looks sickly and has to walk with a cane. He also has been given probation for assisting Lee in her crimes. She admits that she is supposed to be at an AA meeting but has still slipped out to meet with him and to drink. At home, she realizes she wants to write again and the topic will be about her own experiences forging letters - the first time she's writing about herself, as Anna suggested, instead of about someone else. She wants to include Jack in the book and wants his permission. They discuss his illness - it's implied he has AIDS and Lee tells him he did fuck his way through Manhattan - and he tells her she can write about him if she makes him 29 with great skin.Now using a computer, new technology for the early '90s, instead of a typewriter, Lee begins writing CAN YOU EVER FORGIVE ME: MEMOIRS OF A LITERARY FORGER. She also has a new kitten that looks like Jersey.One day, Lee is walking past a bookstore when she sees one of her forged Dorothy Parker letters in the window. She goes inside and asks how much the owner is selling it for. He tells her it's $2,000, framed and mounted. She asks how he knows it's the real deal. He says anyone who knows Dorothy Parker's voice knows that it's really her. Lee goes home and writes a forged letter as Dorothy Parker, with Dorothy's caustic wit, saying she's writing from the grave and telling him what her final thoughts were after being cremated. The bookshop owner receives the letter and realizes he has a forgery on display in his window. He goes to the front and removes it but, after studying it over and realizing how clever the writing is, slips it back in the display.During the credits, we get updates on the people in the story. We're told Lee had forged 400 letters and that two of her fake letters made it into a 2007 biography on Noël Coward until they were finally removed in later reprints. Jack Hock died in 1994 and was taken in by a gay men's shelter at the end of his life. We're also told that Nora Ephron gave Lee a ""cease and desist"" letter to keep her from impersonating her on the phone. And that Lee's book, Can You Ever Forgive Me?: Memoirs of a Literary Forger, was praised by the New York Times.The film is dedicated to the memory of Lee Israel who died in 2014."

Tells the story about a teen who comes into possession of a new laptop and finds that it may have been stolen. He discovers the previous owner may be watching every move he makes and will do anything to get it back. Writer-director Stephen Susco's sequel to 2014 desktop thriller Unfriended stays true to the genre. A group of young adults who convene on Skype for a weekly board-game night are terrorized online by a group of mysterious hackers after one of them steals a laptop filled with snuff films and decides to pilfer $10 million worth of Bitcoin. Matias O'Brien is working on a new laptop he has acquired, originally belonging to someone named Norah C. IV. He begins working on Papaya, an app he is making for his deaf girlfriend Amaya: the app listens to the user's voice and posts their words on the screen. However, Amaya is upset because the app only makes it convenient for her to understand him, but not for him to understand her. Matias keeps getting messages for Norah from someone named Erica. He gets on a Skype video call with his friends - tech wiz Damon, conspiracy theorist and YouTube-personality AJ, DJ Lexx, and couple Serena and Nari - and becomes frustrated with the computer constantly restarting. Serena and Nari reveal that they just got engaged. Serena wishes she told her mom sooner because her mom is on life support due to brain cancer. Matias discovers that Erica is actually Norah. As he had taken the laptop from a lost and found bin at a cyber cafe, he prepares to return it. He sees a message for Norah about payment they received for a video. Curious, he converses with this mystery person.. Using a laptop he secretly stole from a cybercafé's lost and found, Matias O'Brien communicates with his hearing impaired girlfriend Amaya DeSoto over a Facebook call. Matias shows Amaya the progress he made with his software program 'Papaya,' which translates speech into ASL videos. However, Amaya remains disappointed that Matias spent time on a shortcut instead of directly learning sign language to speak with her properly. The call drops and Matias is unable to get Amaya back.Matias participates in a webcam game night with his friends Damon Horton, AJ Williams, Lexx Putri, Serena Lange, and Serena's girlfriend Nari Jemisin, all of whom are in different locations. While the six friends remotely play Cards Against Humanity, Matias works on reconnecting with Amaya as well as dismissing repeated messages sent to a Facebook account registered to 'Norah C. IV.'To everyone's delight, Serena and Nari announce that they got engaged. The news is tempered by the revelation that Serena's mother is still in the hospital suffering from cancer.With Matias' laptop plagued by persistent technical problems, Damon recommends scanning the hard drive for hidden files. Matias finds a massive archive of videos collected from various surveillance cameras and hacked webcams organized by address.Amaya finally calls back. She and Matias discuss their communication issues.Facebook user 'Erica Dunne' sends repeated messages to the Norah C. IV Facebook account until Matias finally responds. The person on the other end reveals that he is not actually Erica Dunne, but the man whose laptop Matias stole. Matias ultimately confesses that he stole the computer and tells the man he will return it to where he found it.Before the laptop can shut down, Matias receives a message from 'Charon 68' asking to discuss a custom job in a secret online location called 'The River.' Matias looks up 'Charon' to discover he was the mythological ferryman of Hades who escorted the dead across the river Styx. As the other friends finally see what is happening on Matias' screen, Matias admits that he stole the laptop because he wanted a better computer to complete his Papaya program. Matias realizes he stole the computer from 'Charon 4,' as 'Norah C. IV' spells his name backwards. Matias also discovers that Charon 4 has a cryptocurrency account containing ten million dollars in bitcoin.Seemingly believing he is speaking with Charon 4, Charon 68 commissions a snuff video of a victim dying from trephination. Matias immediately turns off The River.Matias digs deeper into the hard drive to find a folder labeled 'Contributions.' The six friends are shocked when Matias finds apparent snuff videos of a woman named Agatha chained up in a warehouse as well as a woman named Samantha drowning in an acid bath. Charon 4 intentionally shows part of his face to the camera in the most recent video depicting his kidnapping of Erica Dunne, whose Facebook account was used to contact Matias.Matias reestablishes contact with Amaya's computer, but Amaya's roommate Kelly greets him instead. The other feeds go dark and Amaya's screen begins glitching as Charon 4 enters the apartment and kidnaps Kelly. Charon 4 tells Matias that he will release Kelly if he gets his laptop back, but will kill her if Matias warns Amaya about what is happening. Charon 4 also threatens to kill Amaya if Matias tells any of the other friends or if anyone disconnects from their webcam game session. Charon 4 explains that Matias must find a way to make Amaya come to him so that Charon 4 can follow her to Matias' location.When the other feeds come back, Matias tries explaining to his friends that he has been working on an immersive horror game and everything they witnessed was part of an elaborate prank. Although they have numerous questions, Matias eventually convinces everyone that he fabricated everything. After much imploring, Matias also convinces Amaya to come to his place just as Charon 4 instructed.While game night resumes for everyone else, Matias verifies that 17-year-old Erica Dunne is a legitimate missing person. Acting on an idea from Damon, Matias drains the ten million dollars from Charon 4's bitcoin account. Matias tells Charon 4 that he will only return the money if Erica Dunne returns home safe. Charon 4 warns that The Circle of Charons will never allow what Matias is asking.Suspecting that Charon 4's account was hacked, The Circle forcibly pulls Matias into The River and demands that he recite their code to prove his identity. Fearing that they will both be killed if The Circle discovers his laptop was stolen, Charon 4 shows Matias his face and tells him what to type.The Circle demands to know why the bitcoin account was suddenly drained. Posing as Charon 4, Matias claims he was merely switching to another form of cryptocurrency. More Charons join the anonymous group call as Matias is questioned.Having suspected something was off about the videos Matias claimed weren't real, Nari confirms that Erica Dunne really is missing. Meanwhile, the other friends notice that Lexx is away from her computer. A YouTube video suddenly plays on everyone's screens showing a Charon pushing Lexx off a building's roof.Because Charon 4 hacked Amaya's phone to monitor Matias, Matias directs Amaya to take the subway so that her signal will be lost. During the service interruption, Matias frantically explains that everything the friends have witnessed is in fact real. Matias further explains that to keep everyone safe, they must pretend as though nothing is wrong when Amaya's signal comes back.Once the Cards Against Humanity ruse resumes, Damon gains admin access to Matias' laptop to hack the computer from his London location. Pretending to leave for a different reason, Nari makes her way to the subway to meet a friend on the LAPD.Charon 1 hacks AJ's YouTube channel. Charon 1 splices a series of voice clips into a threat that he phones in to 911.

A Charon pushes Nari in front of a subway train, although Nari manages to pull the Charon with her. Serena is then murdered in her home.Damon threatens to expose The Circle's cabal as he continues downloading the files from Matias' laptop for evidence. The Circle has Damon watch as they edit the Erica Dunne kidnapping video to put Matias' face over Charon 4's. Damon realizes that The Circle planned for the laptop to be found all along so that they could frame the friends for the Charon crimes. Charons plant Erica Dunne's unconscious body in Matias' apartment after Matias leaves to look for Amaya.A Charon infiltrates Damon's London flat and hangs him. The Charon then forges a suicide note confessing that the friends committed the murders.Matias then gets a call from Amaya outside an unfamiliar location asking where he is, saying he changed the meeting spot. Matias realizes the Circle has hacked his messages to make Amaya go to the factory from an earlier video. Before he can warn her to run away, the Circle hack his phone and launch the Papaya app, making it tell her to go inside. The call is forcefully hung up, and it cuts to a camera feed inside the factory. Matias watches Amaya get attacked by a Charon, presumably to torture or kill her for another video. Broken, Matias asks the Circle why they did all of this, and they repeat a clip of him earlier saying ""After all, it is game night"", revealing that this is simply entertainment to the Circle members.The Circle members launch a poll to decide Matias's fate. The camera switches as Erica Dunne wakes up in Matias's apartment and goes to the computer, begging for help. She pulls a cork out of her forehead to reveal the hole in her skull from trephination and freaks out before the video cuts off. A camera feed of Matias in the road is added as the poll finishes with the Circle deciding his death. As he looks at his phone, he is run over by a Charon in a large van. With their job done and their crimes pinned on Matias and his friends, the members of the Circle at each death scene go to their cameras and take off their masks, smiling, including Charon IV (whose apparent anger and paranoia demonstrated to Matias earlier in the film were clearly just an act to keep the game going), as it is revealed that the audience's point of view was actually from a Charon's computer.Alternate ending (a.k.a Buried Alive)
In the second ending, Matias texts Amaya to meet him in a familiar spot; where he filmed a video of them hiking and sharing a kiss. He arrives at the site and finds a hole dug in the ground with an open casket, before a Charon knocks him out.Later Amaya arrives and the hole has been filled. She calls Matias and his ringing phone wakes him up. He realizes that he has been buried alive and tries to text Amaya about his predicament but the Circle changes all of his messages to: ""I wish I could sign better."" When he attempts to video chat, the Circle pixelates his mouth so Amaya cannot read his lips. Amaya gets mad and hangs up, leaving Matias to die as he runs out of air."
Early Man,2018,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4701724/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Set at the dawn of time, when prehistoric creatures and woolly mammoths roamed the earth, Early Man tells the story of Dug, along with sidekick Hognob as they unite his tribe against a mighty enemy Lord Nooth and his Bronze Age City to save their home. An asteroid collides with the prehistoric Earth, causing the extinction of the planet's dinosaurs, but sparing a tribe of cavemen living near the impact site. Finding a roughly spherical chunk of the asteroid that is too hot to touch, the cavemen begin to kick it around and invent the game of football. Many years later during the Stone Age, a young caveman named Dug (Eddie Redmayne) lives in the village with the chief Bobnar (Timothy Spall) and many other cavemen such as Asbo, (Johnny Vegas), Gravelle (Gina Yashere), Treebor (Richard Ayoade), Magma (Selina Griffiths), Barry (Mark Williams), Grubup (Richard Webber), Thongo (Simon Greenall) and Eemak (Simon Greenall). One day, Dug suggests to Bobnar that they should try hunting woolly mammoths instead of rabbits, but Bobnar brushes him off.. It's the Neo-Pleistocene age, somewhere near Manchester. England is currently a badlands of sparse plants, volcanoes, and extremely brutal cavemen who spend their days warring with each other over the slightest provocation. Then, a massive asteroid crashes into the land, striking and killing the last two dinosaurs and causing a shock-wave of dust that buries all the cavemen in the area. When the smoke and dust clear, the impact has made a huge valley in the middle of the badlands, and in the center of the valley is what's left of the meteor, now polished smooth by the friction of the atmosphere into a spheroid shape. The cavemen dig themselves out of the dirt and go down to investigate, find out the object is too hot to touch, and start playing 'hot potato' with it. Eventually they start kicking it instead of tossing it around, and after it cools off, they realize this is a fun game and start adding rules and goalposts and referees. Thus, the game of soccer/football is born.Fast forward several ages. The valley, perhaps because of the meteor impact, has become the only truly fertile ground in the area, with the rest still a wasteland. Dug, a young and ambitious caveman, and his pet Hognob (who is a warthog who acts like a dog), are busy gathering fruit for the tribe, well before anyone else is up. They hear the footsteps and trumpeting of a mammoth in the distance, and hurry back to wake the others. The tribe is a motley group of not-too-bright cavemen and cave-women, but they act as a family and care deeply for one another, even accepting one member who has painted a face on a rock and thinks it's really a person and talking to the rock with him as if it's real. Dug tries to convince his chief that if they band together they could take out larger prey like a bison or a mammoth, but the Chief is very safety-conscious and also doesn't have much faith in the intelligence of his tribe, so he insists they stick to rabbits as they always have done. Dug continues to try to convince him, believing the tribe is capable of being more and doing more. The Chief takes him to a rock of old cave drawings of their ancestors kicking a football around. None of the cavemen know what a football is - it seems the sport has been abandoned - and they assume it's an image of their ancestors hunting small animals. He tells Dug that their purpose is to hunt small things, and after a quick morning prayer of thanksgiving for the fertile land they are blessed to live in, they set out and catch a rabbit, bringing it back and celebrating with drums and dancing around the campfire.As they are celebrating, Dug tries once more to convince his chief the tribe has more in them than just being simple rabbit hunters, and reminds him a single rabbit isn't very much food. Before the chief can argue, there is a sound of heavy footsteps. The cave tribe stop their music and dancing, and go out to investigate. A huge mammoth coated in bronze armor thunders through the trees, followed by two others who start destroying the cavemen's village with huge 'wrecking balls' made of bronze tied to their heads. The armored 'drivers' of the mammoths seem to neither notice nor care about the cavemen running around, any more than if they were animals. Dug's tribe flees to the badlands before they are killed, but Hognob is still barking at the intruders and Dug goes back to rescue him. Both end up falling in a ditch, and the Chief starts to go back for him, but sees a large tree fall and assumes Dug and Hognob were killed by it, sadly retreating with his tribe.Hiding under the tree in the ditch. Dug and Hognob watch as a pompous balding man descends from one of the Mammoths in a mechanical dumbwaiter. This is Lord Nooth, the governor of a nearby Bronze Age village. He looks around the wreckage of the cavemen's village and starts picking up rocks, pointing out to his men that there is bronze ore in them. He instructs his men to begin digging deeper into the caves to mine the ore. When one man asks what they will do about the natives, Nooth callously says the Stone Age is over and that they will have to make do in the badlands until they die out. This infuriates Dug, who grabs a spear and tries to kill Nooth. He leaps out of the ditch, but one of the swinging wrecking balls catches him in mid-air and he falls into a cart, unconscious. Hognob returns to the rest of the tribe alone, mourning Dug, also thinking he will be killed.Unnoticed by the Bronze Age soldiers, Dug is taken back to their village in the cart. Wrapped in a blanket to disguise his bearskin clothes, he wanders around the more modernized village, which in fact turns out to be a massive city perched high on a plateau above a river of lava. The only grass in the place is inside a large castle and arena which dominate most of the landscape - the rest is a dusty, bare city with people selling their wares out of tents. Dug discovers such things as sliced bread, bronze pots and pans, and other modern things his people have never seen. One seller, a young lady named Goona, berates him for messing with the bronze wares she's selling. When he tries to explain he doesn't know what Bronze is, she is shocked. However, before they can converse further, a gong and a chant from a high tower signals all the people of the city to the arena. They have to pay 50 gold pieces to be allowed to enter - Dug, who has no money and is caught up in the crowd, is pushed by before he can pay. He has guards chase him for skipping out on paying, and running through the dungeon-like passages under the arena, finds his way into a room where a man is taking a shower. He steals the man's clothes and armor and comes back out in disguise, but other men in the same uniform grab him and, mistaking him for their comrade, bring him out into the arena with them.Lord Nooth comes out of the castle at one end of the Arena and demands to know who will challenge his champions, and a group of painted, bearded viking-like men roar out that they will. Lord Nooth's soldiers mock them, and Dug braces himself for a battle. However, it soon becomes apparent that the 'sacred challenge', which the people of this city take extremely seriously, is actually a football match between two rival Bronze Age cities. Dug is made the goalie, but he has never seen or played football before, and his teammates keep yelling at him for his mistakes. It isn't until a football hits him in the head that Dug has a flashback to the paintings on the rock the chief showed him, and realizes they are of his tribe's ancestors actually playing this game he's stuck in. He tries to emulate an image from the rock and do a back-flip kick, but scores an own goal. The crowd boos, and the man whose clothes he stole - the real Goalie of Lord Nooth's team - appears, exposing Dug as an impostor.Lord Nooth is furious that Dug would invade the hallowed ground of their arena, but Dug retorts that Nooth's soldiers did the same for his home so he has a right. Nooth callously repeats the sentiment he expressed earlier that there is no place for Early Man on this earth, and orders two of his personal guards to torture and execute Dug. Dug retorts by stealing a trident and puncturing the football, and loudly challenging Nooth's team to a football match. Nooth initially refuses, because of the scandalous nature of letting cavemen into their arena, but when his adviser makes an offhand comment that the vulgar masses would pay to see such a scandalous spectacle, the greedy Nooth realizes he could make a fortune and, assuming his specially trained team can't loose, accepts the challenge. The stakes are high, however - if Nooth's team loses, they forfeit their right to the rich bronze mine in the valley. If Dug's people lose, not only do they lose the valley, they lose the right to live on the outskirts in the badlands and will be Nooth's slaves working in the mines until they die. Dug is granted only one football to practice with, and returns to his tribe, who are delighted to see he survived. However, they are less than thrilled when he tells them of the bargain he has struck with Nooth, as none of them even know what football is.Dug reminds his people of the paintings, and it dawns on them that if their ancestors could do it, they might have a chance. The Chief is the only pessimistic one of the bunch and he soon is proved right - his people are terrible. He himself doesn't even participate, just watching and trying to convince Dug to go back to Nooth and call off the match. Eventually, one hungry tribe member tries to kill a massive duck-monster and angers it, and it chases them, stepping on and destroying their only ball. The chief orders Dug that night to call it off, because they have no hope. Dug considers it, but looking down at the beautiful valley that he calls home an imagining never seeing it again is just too much for him, and he sneaks back into Nooth's city to try to steal some more footballs.Meanwhile, Queen Oofeefa, the ruler of the Bronze Age cities in that area, has found out about Nooth's deal through her spies. She is livid, being more perceptive than Nooth and realizing that Dug wouldn't have made the challenge if he thought it was as hopeless as Nooth has assumed the situation to be. She warns Nooth via message bird that he had better not lose so vital a match. Nooth's adviser also tells him if they lose, Nooth will likely be removed from his role as Governor of the city and coach of Real Bronzio, the football team he has put together and trained to be champions. Nooth is more concerned about the revenue he will lose, but he scoffs at the notion that Real Bronzio could lose to a bunch of what he calls ""brutes"".Dug infiltrates the stadium/castle a second time. He and Hognob start searching for the storage area. After being baffled by his first experience of a glass door, tripping on a wet floor sign and falling down the stairs noisily to the turf, Dug is knocked unconscious by the impact. Hognob is about to go down and rescue him, but then Lord Nooth calls out from the castle to demand what the noise is, assuming Hognob is his butler Stefano. Hognob hurries in and gives Nooth a massage, hoping that will distract him. Nooth doesn't look around at any point, so the deception goes unnoticed, at least for the moment.When Dug comes to, he hears a voice and realizes he is not the only one who has sneaked into the arena. Goona, the pan-seller he met earlier, who was also in the arena the day he challenged Nooth, sneaked in after he did and is practicing her penalty shots. She is clearly an excellent footballer, and Dug watches in admiration. However, when he moves nearer to get a closer look, he steps on something and she hears. He tries to flee, but trips, and she catches up to him. When Goona meets him, however, she reveals that she is extremely impressed by Dug's dedication to his tribe's cause, and approves of his challenging Nooth. She practices every night in secret. Her dream has always been to play for Real Bronzio, but as Dug already observed, the team has only male players, and Nooth wants to keep it that way, having the same dislike of women that he does of cavemen.Dug offers Goona a deal - if she will come help him train his tribe, he will let her play on their team. Goona leaps at the chance and even helps him to get some footballs from the storage closet. The two are discovered and use some of the balls to knock out guards, fleeing up the stairs and through Nooth's palace. The timing is perfect, as Nooth just turned around and discovered that it was Hognob and not Stephano massaging him. They rescue Hognob and they hurry out of the city, back to the badlands.In the morning, Dug introduces Goona to his tribe. They are all happy to meet each other and hopeful of what her experience can do for them. She warns them what they're up against, telling them of each player's strength. However, she explains their one great weakness is that they do not see themselves as a team, each player focusing on his own stardom and quick to berate or belittle the others. Dug's team is a family, and Goona believes that if they can sharpen their skill and get the Real Bronzio team to turn against each other, they have a reasonable chance of winning. She then uses the fact they have no training facility but just the badlands to work with to her advantage, training them using rocks, lava runs, and bones. Even Chief, skeptical at first, starts to enjoy himself and get up hopes as he watches his tribe's great enjoyment and dramatic improvement. Chief himself plays goalie, and also becomes good at it. Hognob wants to play, but Dug isn't sure if that's a good idea, and makes him sit it out. The cavemen continue rigorous training, create their own uniforms and even tame the giant duck to help them in their training. Queen Oofeefa's spies watch all this and she becomes seriously worried.Nooth's miners discover the pictures of the cavemen's ancestors playing football, and this shakes Nooth's confidence considerably. Furthermore, Oofeefa's message bird comes to him and gives him a serious dressing down for having agreed to something as risky as the football match, warning him he'll be in serious trouble if they lose. Nooth still believes his people can win, but reasons a little extra assurance won't hurt. His men examine the paintings more closely, as well as several more they found down the mine that Dug's people don't know about, and make a startling discovery which Nooth thinks he can use to get Dug to call off the match. He has his men kidnap Dug and drag him to the mine.Nooth forces Dug to look at the pictures, which show that Dug's ancestors did indeed invent football and play it all those years ago, but gave it up and threw their football in the river after they realized that other tribes were learning to play and beat them every time they played together. This shakes Dug to the core, as he has all along held to the hope that they have innate ancestral abilities to play football. Nooth whispers a deal to Dug, then abandons him deep in the mine to think it over. Dug has horrifying visions of his people enslaved, whipped, and dying in the mine, blaming him for it. By the time Hognob tracks him down, Dug decides he just can't risk their losing, and he runs out of the mine to accept Nooth's bargain. Hognob, afraid of what Dug will do, goes and gets the Chief, dragging him down the mine. Chief sees the pictures, realizes what Dug has gone to do, and is horrified.In the arena, the crowds have gathered tenfold to watch the game. Nooth is charging double fees for admission, which angers many, but they pay it because they want to see the match. Oofeefa herself actually makes an appearance, stealing Nooth's throne and making him stand to watch the match. However, Nooth is confident, as he has struck a deal with Dug. When the ceremony begins at the start of the match. Dug, instead of saying the ceremonial words, announces a scripted response fed to him by Nooth, in which he forfeits the game and offers the valley and his sole service as a mine slave to spare the rest of his family. Oofeefa and the crowd are disappointed, especially when Nooth announces there are no refunds and that everyone must go home.Suddenly, there is a loud roar, and the giant duck flies in, with the entire caveman team (still called ""the Brutes"" by Nooth and the Bronze Age people, even on the scoreboard) on his back. Dug tells the Chief what he's done, but the Chief tells him there is no way they are quitting, after Dug has pushed them to become a greater and stronger tribe than they ever were before, and reminds him their ancestors are dead, and don't matter right now. The Chief believes they are good players and have a chance. Thus inspired by his formerly-pessimistic Chief's confidence, and the eagerness of his tribe to at least give it a go, Dug recants his surrender and the match begins. Nooth is irritated but not too worried. Queen Oofeefa is very displeased but decides to watch and see what happens.Much to everyone's shock, Dug's tribe scores a goal within the first twenty seconds of play. The Real Bronzio team counters with a goal of their own and Nooth reassures the Queen that the one goal from the cavemen was a fluke. However, Dug takes Real Bronzio's goal as a further challenge and demands his team play harder. They score two more goals, one of which is scored by Goona. Recognizing her as one of their own, and starting to be impressed by the caveman team, the Bronze Age crowd begins cheering for her and the others. Nooth is disgusted when he realizes that Goona is a girl, but when he expresses this he realizes that Oofeefa disapproves of his discrimination and he takes out his frustration on his team, threatening them with quite literal death if they don't get their act together. Real Bronzio has, as Goona predicted, dissolved into a bunch of bickering and backbiting, but they take the threat seriously and play on, getting another goal of their own.Nooth decides enough is enough and makes an excuse to go down onto the arena. He knocks out the referee and then dresses in his outfit, announcing he is the new referee. He then orders his team to hurt Dug's team as badly as possible. Even the Bronze Age audience realize the duplicity, and liking the sport for its fair nature, are disgusted. Oofeefa herself is shocked and disgusted as the Real Bronzio players are forced to injure Dug's team, and no fouls are called. However, when Dug steps in front of a Bronzio player right at the last couple seconds of play, a penalty is called by Nooth, to the absolute outrage of the onlookers. Chief is taken off the field, too injured to continue playing, and a penalty kick is called. As he is being carried off to recuperate from his back injury, Chief tells Dug that he's sorry for having held him back all these years Dug has wanted to do greater things, like hunt mammoths instead of rabbits.The Bronzio player lines up to make the kick but there is no goalie. Dug finally decides to put Hognob in the game, but they are certain that the match is over - it is tied at 3 goals apiece and Real Bronzio's team never misses penalties. Even Oofeefa, who has now become impressed by Dug, and totally disillusioned with Nooth, looks sad at this prospect. However, Hognob blocks the penalty kick, but just barely. It ricochets high into the air. The Real Bronzio team all leap after it at once and get tangled together in doing so. Dug's team, however, works together to rocket Dug high up in the air, and he kicks the ball into the other goal, thus winning the match 4-3 in the last seconds. The stadium goes absolutely wild with cheers, and a horrified Nooth flees in the melee, hoping no one will notice. The Bronzio players are stunned, some of them weeping, thinking Nooth will punish them. However, the cavemen all go to their opponents and help them up from where they have fallen, shaking their hands and telling them they played well. The captain of Real Bronzio is touched, and returns the favor, telling Dug his team gave them a great match. Oofeefa descends from the throne and tells Dug that he and the other Cavemen, through their teamwork, have reminded her and the people what the sport was really about - a good time to be had by all and played fairly. This is something they had forgotten.Nooth attempts to gather as much money as he can and flee in the mascot's costume, but is stopped by the duck, who shakes him and scatters bronze coins everywhere, before dropping him to the ground where he is arrested and carried away. Oofeefa then presents Dug and Goona with the trophy, and the team celebrates. She then orders Dug and his team to leave the arena, and to return home to the valley. Dug and Goona are carried off by the rest of the team in triumph.Some months later, a new painting has been added to the rocks, of Dug and his team carrying the trophy home. Goona has decided to live with Dug's tribe, but using her bronze-tipped arrows instead of a stone spear like the rest when they go hunting. They go after a large shadow, thinking it's a Mammoth, but then the shadow roars at them and becomes the shape of a dinosaur-like creature and they flee. As it turns out, it's the rabbit they tried to catch and eat at the beginning of the film making shadow puppets to spook them, and he giggles. Images in the credits show that the members of the Real Bronzio team have befriended the cavemen, coming to visit and join in their campfire celebrations after hunts."

She calls the police but they do nothing when they see the signed release. After physical altercations with a patient and a staff member, Dr. Hawthorne says she is being kept for seven more days. Another patient, Nate Hoffman, gives Sawyer an introduction to the place. Highland Creek is running a scheme to milk health insurance claims for profit. They trick people into voluntarily committing themselves as long as the patients' insurance companies continue to pay; when insurance claims run out, the patient is ""cured"". One day, Sawyer sees David Strine, her stalker, working as an orderly under the assumed name George Shaw. She has an outburst and is restrained. Her outbursts result in the repeated use of restraints and sedation.. The film opens with the voice of David Strine (Joshua Leonard) telling a woman that he loves seeing her in blue, as she was wearing that color when he first met her, and now he wants to feel the same way he did when he first met this woman.Sawyer Valentini (Claire Foy) works as an over-the-phone salesperson somewhere in Pennsylvania. She thinks she sees David walking into her workplace, which frightens her. Sawyer lives alone and has one work friend named Jill (Sarah Stiles), but she regularly talks to her mother Angela (Amy Irving) who lives in Boston.Sawyer goes on a Tinder date that night and straightforwardly tells her date that he will get what he wants, but after that, he is to never contact her again. Sawyer takes the guy to her apartment where they start to make out, but she has a panic attack and locks herself in the bathroom.Sawyer visits a counselor at a facility called Highland Creek to discuss her issues. She was stalked by David for two years, and it left her unwell, with occasional thoughts of suicide. The counselor suggests that Sawyer sign up for extra counseling so that she may have someone to talk to about her issues.After finishing the paperwork, Sawyer is unwillingly brought to a room where she has her belongings taken and is forced to undergo exams. Sawyer realizes she is being committed involuntarily for the next 24 hours. She attempts to call the police, only for the nurse to tell her that the cops get calls like that frequently.Sawyer is brought to a room where she meets other patients like Nate Hoffman (Jay Pharoah) and Violet (Juno Temple), the latter who pesters Sawyer and threatens to cut her hair off while she sleeps with a shiv she made. Sawyer attempts to leave the room and is approached by a patient named Jacob (Raul Castillo). He tries to touch Sawyer, so she knees him in the groin. When the door opens, Sawyer sees an orderly that she thinks is David, so she slaps him before she is restrained and sedated. Meanwhile, police officers do arrive to the facility, but they leave before they find out about anything.The next morning, Sawyer goes to see Dr. Hawthorne (Gibson Frazier), who tells her they are keeping her there for the whole week after her acts of violence against Jacob and the orderly.Sawyer is forced to take medication for her outbursts. To her horror, one of the orderlies is David, using the name ""George Shaw"". She attempts to convince the others that David is not who he says he is, but this causes her to get restrained. When she sees David again later, he apologizes for potentially offending her while also showing her a piece of mail belonging to Angela.Sawyer finds out that Nate has been keeping a cell phone and speaking to an unknown person on the other end. She convinces him to let him use it to contact her mother to let her know what's been going on. Angela travels all the way from Boston to confront Hawthorne and Highland's administrator, Ashley Brighterhouse (Aimee Mullins). Miss Brighterhouse insists that the work they are doing at Highland is impressive and that Sawyer can leave when she's all better. Angela vows to do everything in her power to get her daughter out.Angela is staying at a motel when she gets a knock on the door from someone claiming to be a maintenance man. It's David.Nate informs Sawyer that the practices at Highland Creek are basically an insurance scam, where they convince the insurance companies that the patient is unwell, allowing them to keep them there for extended periods of time. Nate says he is in there to kick an opioid addiction. As they become closer as friends, Sawyer tells Nate her history with David. She worked in a hospice for David's ailing father, who suffered from Alzheimer's. After he died, David began to harass Sawyer, claiming his father would have wanted them to be together. David would send countless texts and calls until Sawyer blocked him. It progressed to him sending her flowers at work and even breaking into her house to place a blue dress there. It got to the point where Sawyer filed a restraining order against David, as well as having an officer (Matt Damon) tell her what to do in order to make sure David can't find her.Nate is later assaulted in the bathroom by David and taken to the basement where he tortures Nate and sends a picture to a phone that Sawyer acquired. She screams when she sees the picture and tries to tell the other orderlies, but they won't believe her. David later kills Nate by overdosing him with Fentanyl.After more violent outbursts (including throwing coffee at Violet), Sawyer is sent to the basement and put in solitary confinement. She is visited by David, who is still delusional in thinking that Sawyer may still love him. He offers to take her to a cabin where they can be together. Sawyer then berates David and tears him down, calling him pathetic over his obsession with her and not finding anyone else to go after. This drives David to tears.On the outside, a woman is jogging through the park with her dog when they come across a hand buried in the dirt. She calls the cops, and it is later revealed that the victim is the real George Shaw.Back at Highland asylum, David brings Sawyer food and coffee. He once again tries to propose the cabin idea to her. She tells him to get another woman down there and have sex with her in front of Sawyer. David becomes uncomfortable with the idea until Sawyer suggests bringing Violet. He does so and nearly rapes Violet until Sawyer steps in. She pretends to act intimately toward Violet but is really just going for her shiv. Sawyer stabs David in the throat and makes her escape, leaving Violet in there. Sawyer watches as David snaps Violet's neck. Sawyer escapes from Highland but is quickly knocked out by David.Sawyer wakes up in the trunk of David's car. She smells something foul and opens a bag next to her. She finds that it is Angela. Sawyer cries for her mother and takes her cross necklace. She manages to escape the trunk, but David stops the car and follows Sawyer into the woods. Meanwhile, the police return to Highland after ID-ing Shaw's body. Reporters arrive on the scene as well, and it is revealed that Nate was an inside man for a news team to do a report on the activities going on at Highland before he got killed. Still, Brighterhouse maintains that their practices are completely ethical. The police investigate the place and find sufficient evidence to arrest Brighterhouse.David catches up to Sawyer in the woods and fractures her leg by whacking it with a hammer. He takes her unconscious body further into the woods. He lays down next to her and tries to talk to her lovingly. Sawyer turns out to be conscious, and she pulls out her mother's necklace and stabs David in the eye before going for the shiv again and slicing David's throat finally killing him.Six months later.Sawyer is having lunch with Jill, who mentions that Sawyer got a promotion. Sawyer then overhears a man having a conversation with a friend about a woman he loves. She believes it to be David, and she grabs a knife before approaching the man from behind. The man turns around, and Sawyer realizes it's not David. Horrified at what she was about to do, Sawyer runs out of the restaurant... realizing that even though David is dead, she will never be free of his influence."

Beautiful Boy,2018,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1226837/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Based on the best-selling pair of memoirs from father and son David and Nic Sheff, Beautiful Boy chronicles the heartbreaking and inspiring experience of survival, relapse and recovery in a family coping with addiction over many years. After he and his first wife separate, journalist David Sheff (Carrell) struggles to help their teenage son (Chalamet), who goes from experimenting with drugs to becoming devastatingly addicted to methamphetamine. Directed by Felix Van Groeningen (The Broken Circle Breakdown), and based on Sheff's bestselling memoir ""Beautiful Boy: A Father's Journey Through His Son's Addiction"". Journalist David Sheff (Steve Carell) is in the office of addiction expert Dr. Brown (Timothy Hutton). He explains that he's not there for an article - he's there because he doesn't know his son anymore - he's a drug addict, doing multiple drugs but most recently crystal meth, and he needs help.Flashback to one year earlier.David and his wife Karen (Maura Tierney) live in San Francisco with their two young kids Jasper and Daisy and David's son from his first marriage, Nic (Timothee Chalamet). One night, Nic doesn't come home. David calls his ex-wife, Nic's mother Vicki (Amy Ryan). The two get into a heated argument about Nic and his behavior. Two days later, Nic returns home, hungover. With his behavior getting alarming, David goes to see a drug rehab counselor, who says their program has an eighty percent success rate. David enters Nic into the program, and the two hug and exchange the word ""everything"" to each other.After some time in rehab, Nic tells David and Karen that he wants to stay on at the rehab center's extension program, a halfway house, and not go to college right away. Later, David gets a call that Nic has not returned to the halfway home. He angrily wants to know why no one is looking for Nic, but is told that their job at that point is not to locate him, but they will be there if he should return. They say relapse is part of recovery. David takes it upon himself to find Nic, eventually locating him in an alley in the rain. Nic vomits inside David's car, and David enters him back into rehab. When he and Karen bring him back, he demands to know the full extent of Nic's drug habits, learning just how many drugs his son is using.Later on, Nic is doing better and tells his dad he wants to go to college. David is excited and drops Nic off at school. Again, they exchange ""everything""s. It goes well at first, and Nic even starts dating a classmate. While at Thanksgiving at his girlfriend's, Nic finds pills in their bathroom and takes them. He begins doing hard drugs again at school, his relationship falling apart. When he next comes back home, he asks if he can borrow David's car in order to go to a narcotics anonymous meeting. Instead, he goes out and scores. The next morning, when the two young children get into a fight because Jasper thinks Daisy stole the money out of his piggy bank, David confronts Nic asking if he stole the money. Nic gets aggressive and denies it, but David realizes he's using again. David says he shouldn't have let Nic go to school, he wasn't ready - but Nic refuses any more treatment and runs away.Caught up to the beginning of the film, Dr. Brown explains that crystal meth is extremely addictive, and that no matter what number he was told, the likelihood of someone overcoming an addiction is closer to eight percent. While searching for Nic, David goes through intense experiences - buying and using cocaine to try to understand his son's experience, and meeting and buying a meal for a young addict girl for some insight. Finally, he hears from Nic, but when they meet, Nic is erratic and high, and says he's clean but needs a few hundred dollars. David refuses to give him money and tries to get him to come home with him, but Nic flees, completely irrational and unreasonable.Later, David receives a call from a hospital in New York telling him Nic has overdosed. David flies to New York only to find Nic checked himself out against doctor's orders, but as he is on his way to fly back to San Francisco, he hears from Nic. He meets him at a diner, and Nic tells him he wants to get clean. In a flashback to when David first sent Nic to stay with his mother for the summer, we learn where ""everything"" came from - when Nic was sad to leave, his father assured him he loved him more than everything in the world, and they repeated it back to each other.David speaks with Vicki, and they decide Nic will go to Los Angeles to live with her and continue treatment there. Nic is very successful - he graduates college, has a good relationship with his sponsor, Spencer (Andre Royo), and is fourteen months sober. Around this time, he drives down to San Francisco for a visit with David and Karen. He gets along well with his younger siblings, but when he returns late from an NA meeting, David makes him pee in a cup for drug testing. Nic understands why, even though he promises he's clean. After he leaves his dad's house, Nic grows anxious and uneasy. He calls Spencer telling him he's having a hard time. Spencer insists he come over for dinner that night, but instead, Nic goes downtown and runs into his old friend from rehab Lauren (Kaitlyn Dever). The two score hard drugs together, take them, and have sex.Vicki calls David and tells her that Nic is missing. The two begin blaming each other and have a screaming match on the phone. David once again packs a bag to look for Nic, but Karen tells him she needs him to stay home. When David says he needs to make Nic better, Karen shouts at him that he can't - he can't fix this. Later, while his family is out, Nic and Lauren break into their house. When the family returns home, they flee out the back, but Nic's brother spots them. David and Karen go in different directions, and when Nic takes off in his car, Karen gets into her car and chases after them for miles. She eventually loses them and breaks down crying.When Lauren overdoses, Nic calls an ambulance, and though the EMTs are able to save her, he is left alone. He calls David, and tearfully begs to come home, he doesn't want to go to rehab but is willing to come home. David stays firm and tells him he can't do that; he can't take care of him; Nic needs to call his sponsor and take care of himself. He wishes his son luck and lets him go. Time passes, and Nic is still missing. Vicki calls and begs David for help finding Nic, but David can't do anything anymore. Vicki is sure he will be dead soon if they don't do anything, but David has to distance himself.David and Karen begin attending al-anon meetings to deal with their situation. Nic overdoses again, nearly dying. David comes to the hospital to see him. He takes Nic, who is very weak, on a walk outside, and the two sit on a bench together. Nic collapses in his father's arms, hugging him tightly. David rubs his back as the two look to an uncertain future.The post-script tells us that though it is a constant struggle, Nic has been sober for eight years."

Boy Erased,2018,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7008872/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The son of a Baptist preacher unwillingly participates in a church-supported gay conversion program after being forcibly outed to his parents. The Eamons family's lives center on their evangelicalism, on patriarch Marshall (an associate Baptist pastor), and on only offspring, eighteen-year-old Jared, a freshman at a Christian college. Initiated by an unfounded accusation, Marshall and his wife Nancy send Jared to a conversion therapy assessment camp under the direction of Victor Sykes, the aim of the camp to decide on the next step of the appropriate conversion therapy. Accompanied by Nancy staying at a nearby hotel, Jared willingly goes in knowing his own internal feelings regardless of what his parents have been told about him in that half truth accusation. Jared's recent past leading up to this moment is told in flashback, an outwardly straight-laced existence of that centered on the church and the long-term ""natural path"" of marriage - which thus included Chloe, a girlfriend in high school - and children. While Jared does his best to adhere to what is asked of him to tell his truth, that truth may set him on a path to what he needs to do for himself, the question then becoming whether he will be allowed to pursue that path, especially if it goes against Victor or his parents.—Huggo Childhood videos of a sweet, innocent boy (real life footage of the film's star Lucas Hedges) play. The boy now grown, Jared, is a teenager sitting in church while his dad, Marshall Eamons (Russell Crowe), gives a sermon about how nobody's perfect. Jared's mom, Nancy (Nicole Kidman), is cheerful as she listens to the sermon while Jared gets the attention of a young lady nearby. We flash forward to shortly after when Jared, now 18, is being driven by his mom to some location. He puts his arm out the window to simulate surfing the air and his mom tells him not to do that. When he asks why, she says that a kid's arm was once taken off by a truck driver that way. He relents and rolls up the window.Jared gets to a facility where he has to sign in and also give up all his belongings until his mom returns to get him at 5 PM. Michael, an effeminate employee of the clinic, is rather sharp with him regarding him having to give up his belongings (including cell phones which were becoming common in 2004, when the story is set) and tells him that he has to delete anyone from his phone that will be a problem. They will dial numbers at random to verify that he has, so he'd better be honest about it. He takes Jared's journal and says it will have to be reviewed by Victor Sykes, who is in charge. Jared is given a tour of the facility and sees many young people in different rooms, all in various forms of therapy. At orientation, all the incoming teenagers and young adults read the rules out loud, one at a time - females are told they have to wear bras at all times; men are told can't make physical contact with each other except for the briefest of handshakes. Nobody can go into a bathroom without any staff member supervising them. It becomes clear the clinic, called Love in Action, is a gay conversion program.Victor Sykes (Joel Edgerton, also writer/director) gives a sermon to the group. He holds up a dollar bill and tells them that even if he crumples it, it still has its value. Even if he rips it, you can tape it together - it will have a scar but still have value. He considers their homosexual feelings to be sins and a choice they made. He gestures towards a robust teen, Cameron, and points out he plays football though he wasn't born a football player - he chose to play football - and likewise he chose to have homosexual thoughts. Among the other students are Gary (played by musician Troye Sivan) and Jon (played by Xavier Dolan). Jon enters late and we learn he has done the program before and has been forced back - when we first meet him, he has a scratch on his nose and later he has a black eye, alluding to an abusive father. There is also a young woman named Sarah who seems very shy and nervous about being in attendance.The group is told that they have to make a sort of family tree and list all the hardships people in their family have faced. which is a direct line to why they are having homosexual thoughts. Among the list is homosexual/same sex attraction, drugs, alcoholism, gang affiliation, criminal behavior, and use of pornography. Jared makes his tree but can't think of a single thing to attribute to any of his relatives except suggesting that maybe his Uncle Chris is an alcoholic. Victor stops by and notes that his family's lack of toxic behavior is the sign that Jared is truly the son of a preacher. He encourages him to consider his Uncle Chris as an alcoholic since Jared has put a question mark next to the one and only affliction he felt was applicable.We flashback to Jared in high school. He is living a normal life in his Texas high school. He is on the basketball team (but only plays for five minutes) and dates a cheerleader. His dad, revealed to own a Ford dealership in town, grants him a new Ford vehicle for his upcoming birthday. Jared takes his girlfriend to the lake with friends and they have a fun night out. When he drops her off at home, they kiss in the car. She pressures him to do more, but he suggests maybe they should wait. She points out that they're going to college soon.In present day, Jared goes to collect his belongings and returns back to the hotel with his mom. He realizes that pages of his journal have been ripped out. Michael, the bitchy ""ex-gay"" employee, tells him journaling isn't allowed and Victor will have to evaluate the material to see if it's suitable to have written.Outside, Jared meets Jon, who says he had done the therapy before and is being forced to participate again. Jon has a scratch on his nose and explains his saluting people as a purposeful way to avoid male contact.That night, Jared and Nancy go out to dinner and he passes Sarah in the hall, staying at the same hotel with her parent. At the restaurant, Jared asks her if any of their relatives had any problems on the list; she tells him their family has always been ""normal"" and after reading the list, laughs about the idea that they could be related to someone with the kinds of problems listed. At night, she jokes that she was once in prison because of her gang affiliation and drug problems, showing her sense of humor and relationship with her son.The next day at Love in Action, Victor mocks the term LGBT (Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender) and the idea of inclusion for people with various sexual orientations. The group is introduced to an older man with a lot of tattoos named Brandon (played by Flea from the Red Hot Chili Peppers) who tells the group that he doesn't relate to their afflictions (same sex attraction) but he's guilty of a lot of others - implying he was a drug addict and alcoholic - and that his commitment to God had turned his life around. He says that all the counselors there were once like them, and that's when Jared learns that Victor is actually an ""ex-gay"" (shocking because he comes off so homophobic). Brandon evaluates the men on their masculinity and points out that some are sitting with crossed legs, which is not manly. The young men are next lined up outside and evaluated on the way they stand - telling them they have to put their hands on their hips so it forms the strong shape of a triangle. He berates one boy for having his hands turned inward on his hips. He then has female student Sarah line the boys up in terms of masculinity based on how they come off, using her instincts as to who is the least masculine. Cameron, the boy who was applauded earlier for being a football player, is placed at the very end of the line. Brandon berates him nonetheless and makes him feel like he is not masculine enough.The boys are then forced into a batting cage to try to make them more manly. One very small and fey boy is afraid of the ball, yet Victor demands he get close to where the balls are being loaded - one hits the boy in the helmet and he is knocked down. When Jared goes up to bat, he's the only one who is able to hit the ball with ease, which impresses Victor. Each group member has to make a Moral Inventory list of impurities they've suffered. Jared ponders what to write down.At Love in Action therapy, each student/client is required to get up in front of class and give a speech about all their impurities. Called up, Sarah nervously tells people that she ran away from home and stayed with a girl who ""put her mouth on, touched"" and can barely explain that she is referring to intercourse by adding ""my vagina."" It's obviously very painful for her to talk about this in a way where she has to be apologetic and ashamed, but Victor blows off her struggle with a congratulatory response.Afterward, seeing how wounded this public disclosure has left her, Jared tries to console Sarah but, left raw, she absolutely wants to be left alone. An outside ruckus draws everyone's attention. The boy who was beaned by a ball in the batting cage is being removed from the facility by his angry parents, who've paid $3,000 for the course where his son was put in danger and could have had a concussion. Afterward, Victor Sykes hotly admonishes everyone against talking about therapy outside of therapy.Back at the hotel with nothing to say to his mom, Jared writes down Henry's name in his Moral Inventory page.We flash back to Jared starting college. As he struggles to move a lot of heavy boxes, a young man, Henry (Joe Alwyn), assists him and helps him to his room. Henry takes an intense liking to Jared and the two go jogging together, the loser to attend the other's church. One night, Jared and Henry are in Jared's dorm while Jared's roommate is out of town. At Jared's invite, Henry decides to stay the night and goes to sleep on the top bunk. Later, Jared hears Henry tossing and turning and asks if he's having trouble sleeping. Henry climbs down and gets into bed with Jared. There's mutual but cautious attraction at first, but Henry soon climbs unexpectedly atop Jared and begins to rape him, covering Jared's mouth to muffle his screams. This goes on for a while until neighbors, beating on the wall, tell them to be quiet. Henry gets off of Jared, breaks down, admits he has a problem, and confesses that there was a guy at his church (whom Jared met earlier) that Henry'd done ""bad things"" with. (It is later implied he had sodomized that guy, too - not that they were in a consensual relationship).Now a victim of rape and crying in shame, Jared sits distracted in his classrooms and begins blowing off Henry. Henry, infuriated and nervous that Jared will tell authorities what he's done, calls Nancy, pretending to be a counselor at the school, and tells her that her son seems to be a homosexual and she should have cause for concern.Jared is forced to come home where Marshall confronts him about this and Nancy stands by. Jared explains it wasn't a counselor but another student who had admitted to raping someone at his church and made the call because he was afraid Jared would report it. There is still the lingering question of whether or not Jared has had homosexual feelings. After he takes some time, he finally decides to be forthright to his parents and admits that he has had thoughts of men. Both parents seem very distraught by this information.That night, two men come over and have a chat with Marshall. When Jared inquires about this, Nancy tells him that they are people from the church who were asked for advice on the situation. One of them, a pastor, has had a son in the same exact situation over ten years earlier, and they suggest Marshall respond in the same fashion -- to put Jared into gay conversion program. When Jared is asked if he wants to change (his homosexuality), he sees his mom's desperation and replies, ""Yes."" They all pray together.Jared is sent to a doctor (Cherry Jones) to give blood because his dad wants to check his testosterone levels. The doctor says she is a lover of God but also went to medical school and knows that they're not going to find anything except that Jared's a healthy teenage boy. She asks about his sexuality but he skirts the issue, now determined to not disappoint his mother and father.Victor discusses a story by Jared he read and ripped from his journal, a fictional love story about a boy and a girl. Victor asks if Jared secretly meant the two characters to be both boys. Jared says it's just a story for college. Victor tells him that colleges assign books like Dorian Gray and Lolita to students and he thinks it's not the right place for Jared to be right now. Jared always expected the gay conversion therapy to be a very short term thing but he starts to realize he might be forced to stay at the housing instead of returning to school.In therapy, client Gary gives a speech about how he had been living in sin by committing sodomy over am entire year, but now he's ""awakened"" to his sins and thanks everyone, especially Victor, for helping him get back on the path to righteousness.While riding again with his mom, Jared puts his hand out the window to surf the rush of air. She tells him again how she's nervous (that a truck will come by and take off his arm) and he tells her he knows that's never happened. Nancy admits that moms just worry about their kids and want them to be safe. Lying for that reason is a good thing.Growing distant from her at dinner, Jared decides to go on a late night run. While on the street, he passes an advertisement with a sexy male model. He touches the image then throws something at it, breaking it and shouting ""FUCK YOU,"" angry at having feelings for men.Back at the hotel, Jared finds Nancy reading his program book to understand more about what he's going through. In his Moral Inventiory list, he scratches out Henry and writes ""Zavier.""In flashback back to college, Jared meets Xavier at an art school ""God Vs. Science"" exhibit. Xavier is a handsome young Viennese man and the two go back to Xavier's place after the show and discuss the belief of God. Xavier asks Jared if he believes in the devil and then wonders if he considers Xavier the devil (because he senses that Jared is attracted to him). Xavier promises to prove that God will not smite him. He crosses to his bedroom. stays clothed, and sits on the bed. (The scene ends here.)In therapy, Cameron, the boy praised for being a football player, is chosen to do an exercise where he has to talk to an invisible chair as if it was his father and tell him why he hates him - the implication being that hatred of a father is why a man has sexual feelings for other men. Cameron struggles with this, reluctant to call his homosexual yearnings ""my sins"" rather than ""my problem. Coming to his defense, Jared volunteers to do the exercise in his place, but Victor shoots this down and says it's Cameron's task. He then embarrasses Cameron for struggling. Victor releases the class for a break, all but Cameron, who has to stay seated in the chair until he's ready to tap into his anger and show it convincingly to everyone. Sympathetically, Jared squeezes Cameron's shoulder as he passes.On the break, Gary (sporting a black eye) tells Jared that everyone saw his shoulder squeeze and that it violates the rule against touching other men. It's best if Jared abides by the rules and for all to succumb to what is being demanded of them. Jared says they're all struggling to make this work and that he's having a tough time, just like Gary. Gary claims he's fine, but Jared says it doesn't seem that way.Jared, winding up in am institute bathroom by himself, sees Victor outside the window, sneaking a cigarette while nervously looking around, apparently afraid he'll be caught. Brandon finds Jared and scolds him for being in a bathroom unattended. Jared tries to leave but Brandon encourages him to pee as planned. Pee shy, the stream comes off intermittently and Brandon says it sounds like he's using Morse code, asking ""Are you sending me a message, faggot?"" Jared says nothing in response, too afraid to say anything.Outside, Jon tells Jared that he has to ""lean into"" what is being requested of him by the staff or else they will decide that he, like Sarah, has to be housed (in an adjacent building) where he'll have to stay for a year instead of leaving daily like everyone else at 5:00 PM. He should get back home and then figure out what to do next, which could mean walking away from everything and everyone he knows.On the phone, Jared tells his dad he wants to leave, but Marshall tells him to find the strength and commitment inside himself to stick it out. Jared complies. The next morning, Nancy finds a note from Jared saying he's walking to the center and will meet her at 5:00.At Love in Action, the counselors stage a funeral for Cameron. Cameron's family attends, crying over a coffin and pretending that Cameron has died by ""Satan's wishes."" Victor asks Cameron if that's what he wants then invites others to come and ""strike this demon down."" Cameron's dad steps forth, takes a Bible, and beats Cameron with it to exorcise his demons, being very aggressive with how hard he hits Cameron. Cameron's sister is next invited to step forth and have a whack. Jared steps outside to avoid seeing more and to think about this. Jon grabs his arm to compel him to stay; Jared looks at this and both realize that Jon has broken his long-standing practice of not touching another male. While outside, Jared spots Sarah (as she does him). She looks isolated, friendless and trapped. It seems evident that Jared must fall into the program in order to make it through and out.At the next therapy session, Victor says he feels invigorated and asks Cameron how he feels. Cameron says he feels great with the true presence of God in his heart.Flashback: Jared and Zavier lie in bed together, fully dressed but looking at each other, lightly caressing each other's face.It's Jared's turn to give the inventory of his past sins, so he talks about being with Xavier. As he relays this to the class, Victor tells him he is leaving something out. Jared denies he had any other ""gay"" experiences, but Victor tells him his father told him about Henry. Jared says that's not applicable (since it was actually rape), but Victor insists he had slanted the truth to protect himself (upon explaining the situation to his father) and that he needs to stop lying. Jared tells him he isn't lying. He could make something up and say what Victor wants to hear, but then he WOULD be lying, and the whole purpose is to denounce sins. Noting his anger, Victor forces him to parlay that into the exercise where he yells at his invisible dad in the empty chair. Victor encourages him to tell his dad why he hates him and Jared says he doesn't hate his dad. This doesn't assuage Victor, who points out Jared is angry. Yes, Jared is angry, but at Victor, not his dad. As Victor refuses to believe this and keeps insisting Jared is lying to himself, Jared gets fed up and storms out of the room, saying that everyone there is crazy.Jared, chased by Victor and followed by the rest of the class, bursts into the administration area to retrieve his things from the storage unit where they keep the bins with everyone's belongings. Michael, the flamboyant staff member, chases after Jared but Victor tells Michael to let the counselors handle it. Jared runs to the bathroom, with Victor in pursuit, and asks Victor to give him a minute. From a stall, Jared then calls his mom with his retrieved cell phone; fortunately she picks up right away and he tells her, sobbing, that she needs to come get him. Jared then goes out in the hall and says his mom coming to pick him up and they can't keep him anymore. He is pursued and Jared says that if Victor puts his hands on him, the entire class is there and they will be witnesses. When Nancy arrives, Victor and other counselors are holding Jared down while they recite prayers. Nancy is locked out but can see her son through the window in the door. Victor tries to get her to come back later but she refuses and demands they open the door. Compelled, Cameron steps forward, shoves Victor aside, tells them to let Jared go, then guides Jared to the door. They finally unlock the doors and Nancy takes Jared out into the parking lot, pursued by Victor. As Victor tells her she's ruining the boy, she fires back and points out that he's not a legitimate counselor nor qualified to educate or psychologically evaluate, and she should have known better than to give him authority over her son. As she drives away, she shouts, ""Shame on them, then says, ""and shame on me, too.""Jared waits for his mom at an empty restaurant while she has a phone conversation with his father. She returns and tells him his father wants him to go back to the center. While this sinks in, she explains that she had sat idly by while the men decided what would happen to Jared. She now needs her husband to sit by while she makes a decision. Jared returns home but his father has resentment towards him. At church, his dad gives a strong sermon about how you can show up at church but it doesn't make you a Christian, focusing his gaze at Jared. The rest of the congregations shouts ""amen"" to this but Nancy shoots a look of disgust at her husband and clutches Jared tightly.Sometime Jater as Jared packs, the doorbell rings and Nancy asks Jared if he knows Cameron (the football player given a fake funeral who ushered Jared to freedom). Jared wonder in surprise if Cameron's at the door, but Nancy tells him she just learned from police that he had killed himself and the officers have come by to ask questions of him about Love in Action. He answers there questions but has no interest in talking with his dad.Four years later.Jared is now living in New York and has a lot of friends. He is a writer and working on an article. His mom emails him that she was right - he clicks on a link and it's an article about a kid who had his arm ripped off while sticking it out a car window. He Instant Messages her, asking if she's read the article. She has and is proud of him. He then asks if his dad has read it but she changes the subject, asking if he's coming for Thanksgiving. He doesn't drop the subject and says it's important for his father to read about his experience with the gay conversion therapy. She says he'll read it on his own time. When he learns that she's staying with his aunt, he wonders what is happening with their relationship. Nancy says it's only temporary, but it's obvious her relationship with Marshall is strained because she remains supportive of their son and he has not.When Jared next returns home, his dad is out and he asks his mom about their marriage. She says she knows that she has love for God and love for her son and the two don't conflict - for her father it's not that simple. That night, Jared waits on the patio for his dad and then asks him to read his article from the New York Times and tells him there are talks of him turning it into a book. Marshall is cordial but definitely doesn't exhibit any signs of unconditional love - it's clear he still wants his son to ""choose"" not to be gay anymore.One night, Nancy comes into the room with Marshall and gives him a folder - he opens it up and finds the article. He begins to read. When Jared and Marshall are next seen, it is at the Ford dealership Marshall owns. Marshall says he has a present for Jared. He suspects it will be a Ford vehicle, like when he was in high school, but it's actually an expensive pen that Marshall uses for sermons and says he wants to give it to him, ""from one writer to another."" Jared tells him he's gay and that will never change and he thinks they should stop forcing a relationship if it results only in small talk and no connection. Marshall admits he is disappointed he won't have grandkids and also that the dealership won't be Jared's - explaining he always pictured him taking over the family business. Even though Marshall still has issues with him, they seem to find a peace between the two of them.In the end, title cards reveal that the inspiration for Jared, Garrard Conley, now lives with his husband in NYC. The man who inspired Victor Sykes left Love in Action in 2008, and now lives in Texas with his husband. It also informs the audience that, in 36 states in the country, it is still legal to force a minor into gay conversion therapy, which has affected 700,000 people."
Hotel Artemis,2018,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5834262/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Set in riot-torn, near-future Los Angeles, 'Hotel Artemis' follows the Nurse, who runs a secret, members-only emergency room for criminals. On June 21, 2028, a riot breaks out in Los Angeles over the affordability and availability of water after it is privatized. Taking advantage of the distraction, a four-man crew of brothers Sherman and Lev and miscreants Buke and P-22 rob a bank. Unable to break into the vault, they steal from hostages at the bank, realizing that they were mainly staff of the wealthy sent to deposit valuables into the vault. Lev takes a male hostage's fancy pen despite being warned by the man not to. During their escape, an encounter with the police leaves P-22 dead and Buke and Lev critically wounded. They make their way to the nearby Hotel Artemis, a hotel/hospital that only treats criminals, run by Jean ""the Nurse"" Thomas. The Hotel only treats members who are paid-up in advance, so Sherman and Lev are allowed in while Buke as a non-member is kicked out by Everest, the Nurse's assistant. At the Hotel are two other guests. Code names for all guests are assigned based on the suite they are occupying. Sherman is code-named Waikiki, and Lev is code-named Honolulu. The other guests are code-named Acapulco, and Nice. The Nurse gets word from criminal Crosby Franklin that his father Orian ""The Wolf King"" Franklin, is en route and in need of immediate medical attention. Meanwhile, Waikiki catches up with Nice, who has moved on to work internationally while Waikiki has remained Stateside. When he reveals the pen his brother stole during the robbery, Nice explains that the pen is a mobile safe, and unlocks it to show it contains precious diamonds, saying they belong to the Wolf King, and reminding Waikiki that the Wolf King kills anybody who steals from him. To make matters worse, a wounded police officer named Morgan arrives outside begging for medical attention from Thomas.. Los Angeles, June 21st, 2028. While the streets are being torn apart by riots, the Nurse (Foster), who runs a clandestine hospital for criminals in the penthouse of the Artemis, a closed old hotel, has a rough night dealing with troublemaker clients: thieves, assassins, someone from the past and the one who owns the place and the whole city. Los Angeles, June 21, 2028A deadly riot has broken out over the city. Four thieves, led by Sherman (Sterling K. Brown), take advantage of the chaos by robbing a bank. They have to flee before they can open the vault, but Sherman's brother Lev (Brian Tyree Henry) steals what appears to be an ordinary pen from a teller. After blowing a hole through the wall to escape, they are found by four armed officers who exchange fire with the crooks. One of them is killed, Buke (Kenneth Choi) gets shot in the neck, and Sherman's brother is shot multiple times before they kill the guards. Sherman grabs his brother and heads to get help.The thieves go to Hotel Artemis, a secret hospital for criminals run by Nurse Jean Thomas (Jodie Foster). Sherman and his brother scan their wrists with their membership chips implanted, but Buke is denied because his won't scan. After cursing out Jean for this, she brings in her large assistant Everest (Dave Bautista) to take Buke outside. Buke tries to fight Everest, but he overpowers him and forces him to stay outside as the riots are getting closer.Nurse Jean tends to Sherman and his brother, giving them the respective code names of Waikiki and Honolulu. She treats their wounds and also tries to replace Honolulu's liver after it has sustained severe damage. He is put on life support.In other parts of the hotel are Acapulco (Charlie Day), an arms dealer who is there because someone tried to rip his face off, and Nice (Sofia Boutella), a French assassin who purposely hurt herself to get close to a target. He tries to intimidate her until Waikiki/Sherman, who has something of a history with Nice, intervenes. Acapulco tries to be a tough guy and threaten Waikiki, but neither of them are buying it from him.Nurse Jean receives a call from a man named Crosby Franklin (Zachary Quinto), who demands that she treat his father, the owner of the hotel. He and his goons are on their way with the man in order for him to get medical assistance. Meanwhile, the power grid continues to go out as a result of the authorities handling the riots, so Everest has to keep switching the power back on.As the riots are growing more intense and violent, a cop named Morgan (Jenny Slate) is outside the hotel calling for Jean and begging for help, addressing her as Mrs. Thomas. Everest tries to talk Jean against letting her in, but she feels she might know Morgan. Jean grabs a framed photo of a little boy and brings it outside to show to Morgan, who identifies the child as Beau. As they try to pull Morgan inside, a couple of punks try to steal Jean's bag, but she tries to give them a few valuables. The punks are then shot by armed police officers who attempt to go after Jean until Everest shows up and beats them all to death.Back inside the hotel, Jean treats Morgan's wounds, and we learn that Beau was Jean's son who supposedly died from an overdose as a young man. After she gets better, Morgan leaves the hotel.Waikiki chats with Nice, and she reveals to him that the pen that Honolulu took is actually a portable vault containing yellow diamonds valued at $18 million that belong to a notorious criminal called The Wolf King (Jeff Goldblum). Waikiki takes the pen to his brother and shows him what's inside. He wants both of them to leave, but Honolulu is still on life support, so he says he is okay if Waikiki leaves without him. Waikiki then uses a 3D printer to make himself a gun, despite the rules against having a weapon in the building.The Wolf King and his goons arrive with Crosby and his own gang. Wolf King has an injury that needs treatment, so Jean reluctantly treats him. After fixing his wound, Wolf King reveals that he had Beau killed after he stole a car from him. Jean considers killing him in retribution, but killing patients is against the rules of the Artemis.Knowing that Wolf King is in the hotel and since he is a target for her employer, Nice kills the power at the hotel just as Acapulco is trying to catch a helicopter ride out of there. This causes Honolulu's life support to go out, and Jean cannot save him, so he dies. Acapulco's ride then flies away due to potentially being compromised. Nice finds Wolf King's room and slits his throat with a broken piece of glass. She confirms the kill to her employer using a recorder implanted in her eye. Moments later, she runs into Waikiki, who knows what she did, although she expresses remorse for Honolulu's death. Acapulco then shoots Waikiki and nearly goes for Nice until Waikiki fights him and sticks Acapulco's head in the 3D printer, which impales his head and kills him.Nice goes to fend off Wolf King's guys, as does Everest. Waikiki and Jean attempt to escape the hotel until they are found by Crosby, who has found out his father has died. Crosby attacks Waikiki, until Jean throws him medical sealant that he uses to blind Crosby, and then Jean kills him by injecting him with baby elephant tranquilizer.Waikiki and Jean make their way out, but Jean decides she has to stay to help others now that Wolf King and Crosby are dead. Waikiki parts with her on good terms before he heads off to Vegas to a different hotel called The Apache. Everest, having survived his encounter with Wolf King's mob, turns the lights back on at the Artemis, and Jean heads back inside.The mid-credits scene show that Nice has also apparently survived as she runs through the shadows."

He goes pick of his semi-wayward, evacuation-reluctant brother, Afghanistan veteran turned handyman Breeze, and lock up his place. Breeze is called to the local Treasury facility, which destroys used bank notes in bulk, to repair the electric system. In fact it's taken over by a team of crack hackers and armed thugs whose perfect plan goes pear-shaped as maverick armed car trucker Casey Corbyn, stuck due to the storm forecast, just changed the access code. She escapes and is hunted own by the fiends, teaming up with Will and his ideally equipped vehicle, while sheriff Dixon's department proves in league with the gangsters.—KGF Vissers In the year 1991, Alabama is being hit by Hurricane Andrew.

Will knows how strong the storm will be and thinks everyone is underestimating it.Treasury agents Casey Corbin (Maggie Grace) and Connor Perkins (Ralph Ineson) are stuck in traffic on the way back to the Treasury building.

As they head there, three criminals - brothers Clement (Jamie Andrew Cutler) and Xander (Jimmy Walker, plus Jaqi (Moyo Akande) - are installing something to a tower as they see the trucks driving by.Casey is being forced to handle the old money that is heading to the shredder after an incident in Utah that left someone dead, which she feels responsible for. Meanwhile, her co-worker and friend Randy Moreno (Christian Contreras) brings in tech specialists Frears (Ed Birch) and Sasha (Melissa Bolona) to handle a tech issue. The generator then goes out, so Moreno has Casey go out to find Breeze (now played by Ryan Kwanten), who is able to fix it.Will prepares to leave town but then turns around to go look for Breeze, who is a former Marine that now has a repair shop.

Will convinces Breeze to help him board up the windows to his place.Clement and Xander pull up to the gates of the Treasury building before they and a bunch of other guys from their crew start to fire upon the guards and burst in. Moreno tries to handle things, but Frears and Sasha are part of the crew, as is Perkins, who was an inside man that is leading this operation. Frears and Sasha are hackers who messed with the building's shredder so that up to $600 million would pile up, which is what the crew plans to steal. Unfortunately for them, the codes to the safe containing the money has been changed, and only Casey knows the new code. Perkins sends his goons out there to find her while they end up taking the rest of the workers hostage.Casey finds the Rutledge brothers and asks Breeze to go back with her to fix the generator.

Dixon and Xander chase after them through the streets as the rain is coming down hard. Will stops the vehicle and plants it to the ground, causing the villains to crash into it and tumble away. Casey goes over to their car and steals their guns.The two drive by the tower that the crooks bugged. They plan to take it down even though there are Category 4 winds blowing. Will goes up the tower to bring it down but he starts to get blown away while managing to hang on to a wire. Perkins drives by the scene and notices them. He tries to go after them with Jaqi and another goon, but Jaqi ends up driving into a gas station where she dies in an explosion. Dixon and Xander also show up to make trouble. Will manages to hook the tower to his car, and Casey starts to pull so it can come down, just as the crooks nearly have the codes they need to unlock the safe. Perkins, Dixon, and the other goons start to shoot at Will and Casey as they try to unhook themselves. They succeed and get out of there.Breeze attempts to break the hostages free, only for Frears to turn on the electrical current on the gate to prevent him from doing so.Perkins returns to the building to inform Clement that Xander didn't make it. Dixon and his squad of corrupt cops show up with his intention to try and take over the operation. Perkins disagrees and shoots Dixon dead before prompting the other corrupt cops to join him so that they can live and keep some money.Will and Casey hide out in the only mall in town. He is upset with her because she won't give up the codes so easily because he thinks she is just trying to get her old job back, but she is trying to use it as leverage because otherwise the villains will kill off hostages if she lets them get the money. Casey contacts Perkins to let him know where they are after they let her and Will speak to Moreno and Breeze. Perkins sends some goons to the mall to find them. Once the bad cops come in with Breeze, Will and Casey hold themselves onto a wire as they shoot at the skylight, causing the goons to get sucked out into the storm.

Clement also survives it and is found by Perkins, and they find Casey and take her with them. Breeze then shows up on his boat to save Will.Casey is brought back to the Treasury building where she watches Perkins shoot Moreno dead after all the trouble she caused them. Casey is forced to give up the codes, allowing the villains to take the whole $600 million and stash them separately in three semi-trailer trucks.Will and Breeze go back to Breeze's place to get some guns. They know that the thieves are heading toward the eye of the storm, so they proceed to head there to get Casey and stop them. On the trip there, Will apologizes to Breeze for blaming him for their father's death.The brothers catch up to the trucks as they get away from the storm. Casey is in a truck with Clement and another goon. Casey fights Clement, who shoots the driver. She manages to shoot Clement and have him thrown out of the truck.

Based on David Levithan's acclaimed New York Times bestseller, Every Day tells the story of Rhiannon (Angourie Rice), a 16-year old girl who falls in love with a mysterious soul named ""A"" who inhabits a different body every day. Feeling an unmatched connection, Rhiannon and A work each day to find each other, not knowing what or who the next day will bring. The more the two fall in love, the more the realities of loving someone who is a different person every 24 hours takes a toll, leaving Rhiannon and ""A"" to face the hardest decision either has ever had to make.—MB ""A"" is a traveling spirit who wakes up in the body of a different male or female teenager, every day. One day, ""A"" wakes up in the body of Justin, the neglectful boyfriend of Rhiannon. At school, Rhiannon approaches ""A"" (as Justin), and she convinces ""A"" to skip school with her. As the day goes on, ""A"" falls in love with Rhiannon, as she confides to Justin her troubled home life, following her dad's mental breakdown that almost resulted in her family losing their home. Rhiannon, in return, feels a rekindled love for Justin, seeing as he has seemingly changed into a more thoughtful and caring person than he was before. The next day, Rhiannon finds that Justin has reverted to his old, careless self, and doesn't even remember the day before. Meanwhile, waking up in the body of Amy, ""A"" masquerades as an exchange student in order to be close with Rhiannon.. The movie starts with Justin (Justice Smith) waking up in bed and setting his smartphone alarm to 11 pm and 1150pm.The scene cuts to a high school where the main character, Rhiannon (Angourie Rice), is talking about how she's been texting her boyfriend Justin a lot and he never texts back. She sees Justin and runs up to him, asking him why he didn't respond to any of her texts, and apologizing for texting so much. He hesitates for a second before answering her. Rhiannon tells him she wants to play hooky, skip school, and just spend time with him today. They skip school and have a great day in the aquarium, playing on the beach, and just generally having fun.As they're getting ready to go home, Rhiannon tells him about her father; she's never talked to anyone about her father before. She tells Justin that one day he came home and told them he'd gotten a big promotion; booked an entire theater for the family so they could celebrate; then it turned out instead of a promotion, he'd been fired and had a meltdown. Now, her father spends his days painting, and her mother has to work two jobs. Justin listens and is sweet.Justin drives her home, and Rhiannon tells him it was a perfect day. He hesitates and tells her that not every day is going to be like this. She stops him and tells him she wants to end today on a good note. They kiss, and she tells him it's so much better kissing him when he doesn't smoke. He tells her he'll keep that in mind.The next morning, a redheaded girl wakes up and looks behind the wall. She says ""Amy"" under her breath, and sets her smartphone alarm for 11 pm and 11:50pm. At the high school, Rhiannon sees Justin. He's standing by his car, smoking a cigarette. Amy (Jeni Ross) comes up to her and taps her on the shoulder, explaining that she is new to the school and wanted to ghost someone for a day. She asked if she could ghost Rhiannon. Rhiannon agrees.In a lab class, Rhiannon introduces Amy to her friends Rebecca and Alexander (Amanda Arcuri and Owen Teague). Justin comes into the classroom looking for her and asks her if he'd gotten drunk yesterday. She tells him no, and asks him doesn't he remember. He unhappily tells her yesterday was a fog, and now he has a ton of homework he has to make up. He reminds her to go to a weekend party, tells her bye and leaves. She's upset that he had such a different reaction to yesterday. Amy notices and tells her she doesn't think her boyfriend treats her right. She reaches up and tucks a stray hair into Rhiannon's ear. Rhiannon's still upset, so she tells Amy to shadow Alexander for the rest of the day and goes.Scene cuts to a boy, Nathan (Lucas Jade Zumann), waking up, and setting the alarm for 11 pm and 11:50 pm. He goes to his computer and searches for an address on the map. At the party, Justin is having fun and neglects Rhiannon. Nathan walks up to her, and they start having fun dancing. Justin notices them dancing and goes to claim Rhiannon. Nathan reassures him that he's gay, so he's not a threat. Then he suggests he's attracted to Justin, who looks a little creeped out and quickly excuses himself. After Justin leaves, Nathan asks Rhiannon if she'd like to go somewhere quiet to take a break from the party. They find a quiet spot, where Nathan then asks Rhiannon why she's with Justin. She says he's her type and describes that as ""tall, slim, nice shoulders, has a connection."" They talk for a long time, and Nathan ends up leaving late.The next day, Rhiannon's friend is telling her about how a boy, Nathan, was found parked on the side of the highway and was now claiming he'd been possessed. Justin asks why she'd been hanging out with someone crazy like that. Rhiannon gets a text from a strange number asking her to meet, alone, at a coffee shop, saying they'd explain everything. She decides to go because of what happened with Nathan.At the coffee shop, a girl shows up and tells her that she was Justin the day they spent at the beach, and Amy the following day, and Nathan yesterday. Rhiannon is freaked out and disbelieving.The following day, she gets another text from the same number, asking her to meet again. This time, it's a large Asian boy who's waiting for her. He gives her more details, and she starts to believe. He tells her he wakes up every day in a different body, always near the last body, and introduces himself as A. He doesn't know if he has parents, or where he's from. This has been his life (waking up in a different body) for as long as he's remembered. He spends half his time as a girl and tries to leave as little a trace as possible. He shows her an Instagram account he maintains that he says shows the faces of most of the people he's woken up in.Later, she goes to visit Nathan at a church. Nathan tells her he was possessed by the devil and tells her about the Instagram account. No one believes him because he didn't have time to download any pictures before the password was changed. He recognizes her picture from the Instagram (A had posted a picture of her and ""Justin/A"").At school the next day, Rhiannon meets A (as a girl), where A explains he ran out of time to delete the calls and Instagram from Nathan's phone, which is why Nathan thinks he was possessed. Rhiannon believes now and is upset that A kissed her as Justin. A tells her he'd never felt that way about anyone until he met her and that's why he acted so differently that time.In Justin's bedroom later that day, Rhiannon asks Justin about their relationship. He asks her what she means, and she says she wants to know what he feels about their connection. Justin is nonplussed.The scene cuts to Rhiannon meeting A in a library. Now he's a black guy named George. They talk more, and Rhiannon gets closer to A. They lean in for a kiss when they're interrupted by George's mother. A whispers to Rhiannon to run, and she escapes.The next day, A wakes up in Rhiannon's body. He's excited and can't stop smiling, which her sister Jo notices. At school, Justin approaches her, and A blows up at him, telling him he doesn't appreciate her. A storms off, and then after he cools down, he's a little afraid of what Rhiannon will think tomorrow. A goes to Rhiannon's dad's studio and asks her dad why he paints. Her father replies that it's who he is. A writes a letter detailing what happened that day.The next morning, Rhiannon wakes up. She finds Justin at school and tells him they need to take a break. He is upset at being dumped and leaves. She then finds A and tells A/female that she broke up with Justin and remembers what happened the day A was her. She tells A that he should let people keep more of the memories of that day he was in their bodies.The scene cuts to Rhiannon riding in a truck with a guy. They are going driving to her uncle's vacation cabin, which is a three-hour drive away from home. They have a romantic day, and then A leaves with the truck. He promises to come back tomorrow. The next day, it rains, and she waits there all day. A never shows up. Rhiannon has to call her mother to ask her to pick her up from the cabin.A wakes up in another body and realizes that the boy, Michael's, is supposed to be flying to Holland that day. He panics because if he ends up in Holland, that is where he will wake up tomorrow. He calls Rhiannon and asks her to rescue him. Rhiannon comes for him in her sister's car, knocking off the driver's side mirror while trying to escape Michael's mother. Rhiannon is upset that A left her alone at the cabin when he'd promised to come back. A explains he couldn't come because the girl whose body he woke up in was getting a lung transplant that day, and he hadn't woken up until the evening. He also wasn't allowed near any cell phones.Rhiannon is in the car with her sister Jo, who asks her what's going on. Rhiannon tries to tell Jo about A, but Jo doesn't believe her. Jo tells Rhiannon she doesn't care what sort of weird poly-amorous thing Rhiannon is doing, just leave her car out of it (Jo's mad about Rhiannon breaking the car mirror). At school, Rhiannon's friend Rebecca asks her about the rumors she heard of Rhiannon hooking up with a random guy who left her in the woods without a truck. Rhiannon blows up at Rebecca. Later that day, Rhiannon sees A, who's now occupying a suicidal girl's body (Kelsey). A tells Rhiannon that Kelsey has planned out her suicide in detail, and will probably try to kill herself as soon as A leaves her body. Kelsey's father works late and won't be home in time to stop Kelsey.Rhiannon urges A to ""push back"" and try to stay in Kelsey's body long enough for the father to come home. The scene cuts to Kelsey's father coming home, and Kelsey (A) telling her father she needs help.At school, Justin's friends are calling Rhiannon a slut. Rhiannon ignores them and meets A in the girls' locker room. A tells her he can't be with her after school this time because it's the girl's anniversary dinner with her boyfriend. At home, Rhiannon sees her mom and tells her that dad's changed, but so has she, so please can the two parents grow closer again.A wakes up in Alexander's body (Rhiannon's lab friend), and tells Rhiannon what a great guy the real Alexander is. Rhiannon asks A to try to stay in Alexander's body for a while. A agrees, and there's a montage of days where Rhiannon and Alexander/A are having fun at school, kissing, holding hands. Rhiannon makes up with her friend Rebecca, who tells her she always thought Rhiannon and Alexander were perfect for each other.Alexander's phone shows three missed calls from ""mom,"" but A ignores it to be with Rhiannon. At night, Rhiannon and A are at Alexander's front door, and Rhiannon decides to come in. They enter the house where they see a huge ""Happy Birthday Alexander"" sign, and Alexander's family seated at the table with a cake, obviously having been waiting for him.Alexander's mother goes up to see him and tells him that his aunts and she had spent the whole day cooking his favorite foods for him, at his request. She tells him he hasn't been himself lately, spending all his time with Rhiannon, and they love him but he should not to take his family for granted.The next day, A meets Rhiannon and tells her to meet him that night at Alexander's house, as Alexander's family is going to be out of town that night. Rhiannon happily agrees, not noticing that A is quiet and seems like he wants to tell her something. That night, A tells her their relationship has to end, but that the real Alexander is perfect for her. Rhiannon is upset, but A tells her that it's not right. Alexander has a family who loves him, and it's not fair to Alexander for A to keep occupying his body. A also tells her their relationship is blocking Rhiannon from finding the right guy for her. A tells her to imagine what her life would be like 10 or 20 years from now when he could be waking up in a married man's body. He tells her that she will always be his first and only love, but he can't give her a normal life. Rhiannon finally accepts that she can't be with A, but wants to treasure the last three hours together.At the end of the night, they are cuddling in bed, and Rhiannon asks if Alexander will remember what's happened. A tells her he will, to an extent. It's almost midnight, and A goes to sleep. Rhiannon kisses him, and then quietly leaves Alexander's bedroom.The next morning, A wakes up as a rich black girl, Katie, and goes driving out of Katie's house. It's a new day.At school, Rhiannon is putting things away in her locker, when Alexander comes up to her. He has a locker near hers. They put their things away in their lockers, and then Alexander asks Rhiannon, has anyone ever told you that you have a nice smile. Rhiannon flashes back to her first date with A (as Justin) when A told her she had a nice smile. The movie ends with Rhiannon and Alexander smiling tentatively at each other and walking down the school hallway together. The implication is that they will end up together."
Leave No Trace,2018,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3892172/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A father and his seventeen-year-old daughter are living an ideal existence in a vast urban park in Portland, Oregon when a small mistake derails their lives forever. Will (Ben Foster) and his teenage daughter, Tom (Thomasin Harcourt McKenzie), have lived off the grid for years in the forests of Portland, Oregon. When their idyllic life is shattered, both are put into social services. After clashing with their new surroundings, Will and Tom set off on a harrowing journey back to their wild homeland. The film is directed by Debra Granik from a script adapted by Granik and Anne Rosellini.—Bleecker Street After living off the grid in Oregon for years, traumatized military veteran Will (Ben Foster) and his teenage daughter, Tom (Thomasin Harcourt McKenzie), are picked up by social services and forced to integrate back into society. While Tom begins to connect with others and thrive, Will struggles and attempts to avoid his demons by escaping back into the wild. Directed by Debra Granik. Based on the novel ""My Abandonment"" by Peter Rock. Will, an Iraq War veteran suffering from PTSD, lives with his 13-year-old daughter, Tom, in a public park outside Portland, Oregon. They live in almost total isolation, only entering town for occasional food and supplies. Will makes their money by selling his VA-issued painkillers to other veterans. After Tom is accidentally spotted in the woods by a jogger, officers arrest them and place them into social services. They are given food and a house on a Christmas tree farm in rural Oregon, on the condition that Will abides by the rules of the home owner and social services. Will begrudgingly begins to work on the settlement packaging pine trees, while Tom begins school and interacts with local kids her age in a 4H club. Will feels oppressed by others' presence and tells Tom they are returning to the woods. She follows reluctantly. An emotionally broken veteran and his teen daughter have lived off the grid for many years on illegal national park land in Oregon and survived well, and happy. One day, they are found by park police and re-homed. He tries his best to make it work, taking a job on a Christmas tree farm, trading his labor for housing, but feels more comfortable working with the animals than the humans. She wants to stay, she's made a friend, sees what life is like in the ""real"" world, and wants to grow and evolve. Freedom calls him, and they disappear to another state to find peace again until he falls and is barely alive when found. While he is rehabbing his leg, she has the biggest decision of her life to make.—kateann1027 Will is a veteran with PTSD. Homeless by choice and withdrawn from society, his life is both comforted and complicated by the fact that he is raising his daughter as a single dad. When the curtain goes up we find them living in the woods near Portland, Oregon. His daughter, Tom, is about 14 and doesn't remember her mom. They tend a small garden, cook mushrooms, and keep their canvas shelter patched against leaks. Once a month they trek into Portland to shop for necessaries with Will's disability check. Will teaches her all the survival skills he knows, including how to bug out and hide so as not to get ""burned"" by the park rangers for squatting on public lands. Nevertheless Tom is seen one day and they soon get burned and turned over to Social Services.
We cringe with Will as he sits down to take the intake exam, 435 questions to assess his psychological state. He tries but stops answering when the computer-voiced questions get too close. On the other hand Tom does well as the lady social worker soon discovers that she not only reads better than most kids her age but that Will has been a loving and responsible parent in spite of the circumstances.
The social workers reunite them and place them in a vacant house where Will is expected to work at the local Christmas Tree farm. We smile as he is instructed on how to prune a young pine to a perfect point on top to meet the expectations of California customers. Meanwhile Tom meets an older boy who is framing his own tiny house. She takes a liking to his pet rabbit as he describes the floor plan of his trailer-sized home. He invites her to the local 4H club where she learns some rabbit handling skills. Whether Tom feels any attraction to this nice young man is totally left up to our imagination. (Happily there are no sexual encounters anywhere in this film apart from the concern of the various strangers they meet as to Will's intentions toward Tom.)
Tom likes it in their new home but Will is restless. He says that this is not really our house, our food, our furnishings, much less our life. You have to cooperate, he explains, like showing up at church, to keep on their good side. One day he tells Tom to pack only the stuff she needs and they make a break for it, eventually hitching a ride with a trucker who drops them off at a logging road up in Washington State. They spend a freezing night covered in branches and find a vacant cabin the next morning, where they break in and help themselves to some canned food.
Will leaves Tom in the cabin while he heads downhill to find a store to get more groceries, but he never makes it. The next morning Tom finds him injured and unconscious by a stream. She gets help from a family that is camping nearby where a former Army medic nurses Will back to health. The family provides them with a trailer to live in for the time being in their little settlement of old, run down RVs.
Tom likes this new found community of fellow misfits and refugees from civilization and learns some beekeeping skills from the wife of the medic who tended Will's foot . Tom helps her fill a rucksack with supplies for someone who lives alone in the hills as a hermit. Periodically the woman hangs the rucksack from a tree and comes back later to retrieve the empty bag.
Will is determined to leave this little community as soon as his foot heals. When the day finally comes and Tom finds him packing, she confronts him with the realization that whatever is wrong with him is not wrong with her and that she no longer wants to keep on picking up stakes and obediently following him to the next camp. Will realizes the truth of what she says, but knows that for himself things will never change. They part ways.
We know that Tom will be all right but feel sorry that Will, a prisoner of his tortured memories, chooses a hermit's existence. The curtain comes down as Tom hangs a rucksack from the tree one day, presumably for the hermit father she will always love."

Vaseegaran has created new human robot Nila which can understand human feelings better. The cell phones in the city start to disappear from everywhere. A creature in the form of bird creates havoc in the city causing destruction. Vaseegaran believes it to be the fifth element force and decides to get Chitti back in action. When Vaseegaran traces the location of missing cellphones with help of Chitti and Nila he finds that its not the fifth force but a human force done by late professor Pakshi Rajan.—alex.mjacko@gmail.com When mobile phones start mysteriously flying out of the hands of people in Chennai, Dr Vaseegaran and his android assistant Nila are called in for help. The city is under a threat from the supernatural powers of Pakshirajan, a deadly winged monster seeking revenge on mankind for harming birds with mobile radiation. Dr. Vaseegaran is forced to reassemble his robot 2.0, the upgraded version of Chitti to fight against Pakshirajan and save the world.—Santhosh Eight years since Chitti's disassemble, a distraught man commits suicide at a cell tower surrounded by gray skies and dying birds. The next day, several possessed cellular devices take to the skies with a hive like behavior, controlled by an entity not seen before. Dr. Vaseegaran, a reactivated Chitti, and robotic assistant Nila take it upon themselves to find out what the hostile spirit wants and how to put a stop to him.—Almultimavenger It has been eight years since the events of the first movie, Enthiran, in which Chitti is disassembled after his corruption. His creator, scientist Dr. Vaseegaran builds a female android named Nila (Nice Intelligent, Lovely Assistant) and shows her to a group of college students. Shortly after the presentation, one of the college student's cell phone starts to hover in midair, throwing him off his bike. When he tries to grab it, it displays a sparrow on the screen and takes flight into the upper atmosphere. The city of Chennai is thrown into chaos as each and every mobile device in it abruptly flies into the sky. A scientific council led by Home Minister S. Vijay Kumar discusses the nature of the phenomenon. Despite suggestions from the council, Vaseegaran finds it hard to believe the cause is another nation's technology nor alien forces. He explains that the phones are restricted to Chennai and have not crossed the troposphere. A phone company minister at the police station confirms that all the phones are switched off at once, the mass behaving like a hive.Phone retail store owner Jayanth Kumar is seen driving home with an enormous swarm of sentient phones following him. Before he goes to sleep he's interrupted by an audio of his employee telling him that the new shipment of phones they ordered after the chaos has arrived, in his household. The phone swarm reveals itself and traps Kumar in the room, displaying birds on their screens and enter his body, causing him to explode. Police arrive at his house the next day thoroughly confused by the nature of his death as there are no signs of human struggle. Nila and Vaseegaran find scattered minerals and electronic parts of mobile phones. It's revealed that hours before Kumar's murder, his shipment of phones were driven to the rest of the swarm and disappeared. Vaseegaran calls his girlfriend Sana to bait his phone to the rest of the swarm. Him and Nila follow the phone and track it's electromagnetic trail to a small village. They find the swarm active, which manifests as a giant bird's talon. Nila saves Vaseegaran from being killed and the swarm departs.At the council Vaseegaran heavily recommends reactivating his creation, Chitti, to combat the new threat. A member of the council, Dhinendra Bohra,strongly goes against Vaseegaran's plan and explains the destruction Chitti caused eight years prior when he was reprogrammed by his father, whom Chitti murdered. S. Vijay Kumar vetos the plan and decides to have military protection at cell shops and towers. Dhinendra blames Vaseegaran for his father's death and makes it clear that he won't forget. Telecom company owner Manoj Lula is angered at the situation impeding his buisness and complains to telecom minister Vaira Moorthy about it. Lula drives home but the swarm crashes his car and chases him into the forest, where it crushes him to death. The phones shape into a giant bird of prey and take flight.Moorthy is paranoid the next day and has military aid protecting his house. The swarm of phones assault the military at a cell phone tower construction zone and destroy all vehicles and structures. Not long after, Moorthy's phone breaks into the house and inserts itself into his body. Moorthy is admitted into the hospital and Vijay Kumar comes to see him. Moorthy is killed and his phone ruptures through his skin and escapes. A terrified Kumar calls up Vaseegaran and tells him to rebuild Chitti immediatly. It's revealed that Vaseegaran has already retrieved Chitti's old body from a technology museum and is upgrading him with new powers and abilities. Kumar explains that he will hold responsibility for Chitti's actions.The bird attacks the city the following day and dodges the military's defense. A newly built, stronger and faster Chitti battles the bird and leads it outside of town while driving an armored truck. He triggers an explosion when the bird eats the truck and destroys it. The phones now reform into a smaller bird and proceed to attack Chitti, who's low on battery. He crawls to the space station's generator and recharges, but the bird can't enter through the satellite antennae of the station and becomes shocked back. The bird retreats and Chitti shows Vaseegaran the data later. Chitti deduces the nature of the entity to be an aura, specifically a collected mass of negatively charged electrons. Chitti explains that the aura of a living animal will be positively charged and a deceased being will be negatively charged. A scientist at the space station states that they send positive charged signals to search for extraterrestrial life, meaning that the negative charged bird was incapable of entering the stream. Vaseegaran builds a photon synthesizer that emits positive signals at the target, hoping it will contain the entity. Upon analyzing footage of the attack, Vaseegaran sees that a human face shows up on the bird. Nila gives Vaseegaran information on all unusual cell phone related deaths that occurred recently. It turns out that a day before the phones developed this behavior, a man committed suicide just the day before at a cell tower.Vaseegaran, Nila, and Chitti drive the A.I.R.D bus carrying the synthesizer to the village where the phones rest. The bird comes to life and tries to destroy the machine, but Chitti guards it and the majority of the aura is contained in the device. The partially destroyed bird manifests as an egg and hatches into a humanoid figure. Vaseegaran recognizes him as the deceased ornithologist Pakshi Rajan. Chitti tries to convince him to stop attacking, but Pakshi refuses and tries to destroy the machine. Chitti asks why he's doing all this and what Pakshi has against humanity. Pakshi takes him to a dilapidated house, in which a flashback reveals that it was his home and sanctuary for a number of birds he cared for. He tells his student about how a sparrow revived him when he was born still, and since then he has been passionate for birds his whole life. But most recently, since the popularity of modern mobile phones the population of birds in India have been in decline. Pakshi recognizes that radiation from mobile devices is messing with bird's abilities to navigate and think, driving many individuals to insanity and sickness. He holds seminars and protests regarding this but is quickly dismissed and mocked for his concern. He talks to Lula about this, who kicks him out of his office for wasting his time, holding importance to his business and money. Pakshi's own friends turn on him as the demand for cell phone usage removes their land for business when they're unable to farm, with the decline of bird populations leading to overpopulating insects eating too much crops. Over time, one by one all the birds in Pakshi's sanctuary and in the wild, even newborn chicks suffer trauma and pain before death. A heartbroken Pakshi talks to Moorthy and angrily accuses him of the events that have occurred, that there's no reason to hold the lives of birds below humanity when they're the reason for their society's existence. Moorthy retaliates stating that they follow their laws and uphold their business, despite Pakshi previously realizing that the companies have increased radiation standards illegally to increase profit and consumers. Pakshi files a court case but the companies turn their radiation down just before inspection and the case is denied. Pakshi becomes distraught and cries at his bird's graves. He becomes bitter and fantasized murdering every ignorant person who has killed the majority of birds through their hobbies. He becomes depressed and hangs himself at a phone tower. His spirit is awoken by the radiation emitted from the tower and absorbs the souls of all the deceased birds in the city, also absorbing their pain. His spirit transforms into a vengeful aura overwhelmed by grief and begins going on killing sprees against the public.After listening, Chitti sympathizes with Pakshi's pain but explains that killing all those people won't change anything. Pakshi states that the people are too ignorant and careless to understand how their usage of technology is destroying the nature around them. He vows to kill every human whom has contributed, but before he can escape Vaseegaran traps his soul in the neutralization device. Vaseegaran, Chitti, and Nila are applauded by the council for their heroic efforts and an issue is placed by Kumar that an army of 500 Chittis will be donated to the military to protect the nation. Dhinendra becomes jealous of Chitti's victory and breaks into Vaseegaran's lab to release Pakshi's spirit. Pakshi regains control over the phones and possesses Vaseegaran to prevent Chitti from thwarting him. Pakshi, now in his human form has superhuman strength and starts killing people in the city again. Chitti refrains from stopping his own creator and Pakshi dismembers him. Nila breaks into the police station and upgrades Chitti to his 2.0 evil alter ego who won't hesitate to kill Vaseegaran if he has too.Pakshi imprisons eighty thousand people at a soccer stadium and kills Dhinendra, who was present at the game by dousing him in radiation. Chitti breaks into the stadium and summons his army. He and Pakshi shapeshift and battle furiously, but when Chitti is depowered, Pakshi creates several bird drones to tear his army apart. Before he can destroy Chitti, a microbot of Chitti's creation named Kutti interrupts him. He and hundreds of Kuttis, mounted on doves threaten to hurt them if Pakshi doesn't stand down. They self destruct and destroy the drones. After Chitti shoots Vaseegaran, Pakshi leaves his body. The Kutti bots lead Pakshi to the space station and trap him in the signal streams, where Chitti overwhelms him with positive charge and destroys his aura. Vaseegaran recovers in the hospital and explains to a visiting Kumar that Pakshi's violence was wrong but his words were true, and that humanity had no right to bathe in the luxuries of the world at the cost of animal's lives. If they remain careless both nature and technology will turn on them like Pakshi has. Kumar puts forth an order to protect what remains of the bird populations and Chitti starts a relationship with Nila.In the end credits, Vaseegaran's phone transforms into a Kutti bot who enthusiastically greets him."
Stan & Ollie,2018,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3385524/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Laurel and Hardy, the world's most famous comedy duo, attempt to reignite their film careers as they embark on what becomes their swan song: a grueling theatre tour of post-war Britain. The true story of Hollywood's greatest comedy double-act, Laurel and Hardy, is brought to the big screen for the first time. Starring Steve Coogan and John C. Reilly as the inimitable movie icons, 'Stan and Ollie' is the heartwarming story of what would become the pair's triumphant farewell tour. With their golden era long behind them, the pair embark on a variety hall tour of Britain and Ireland. Despite the pressures of a hectic schedule, and with the support of their wives Lucille (Shirley Henderson) and Ida (Nina Arianda)--a formidable double act in their own right--the pair's love of performing, as well as for each other, endures as they secure their place in the hearts of their adoring public. With their golden era long behind them, Laurel and Hardy embark on a variety hall tour of Britain. Despite the pressures of a hectic schedule, the pair's love of performing, as well as for each other, endures as they secure their place in the hearts of their adoring public.—Anonymous Both Steve Coogan as Stan Laurel and John C Reilly as Oliver Hardy give performances that bring back to life these two masters of Comedy. Coogan, not known as a serious actor, turns out a truly inspiring performance as Stan Laurel, portraying Stan as the more forceful member of the partnership and John C Reilly as Ollie, who is quite submissive, this is a complete reversal of the film portrayals of the duo, where Ollie is a 'know it all' and Stan is a dim wit. The film is a fictional story based on their 1953/1954 UK tour and what would ultimately be their last tour together, mainly due to Ollie's deteriorating health. The recreation of famous scenes from the original Hal Roach, Laurel and Hardy films, is remarkably accurate and a joy to watch. The 1953/53 Tour was very demanding on the duo and at times it seems that they were actually starting to dislike each other and that the tour would eventually fold and they would return to the US However things progressed from originally performing their show to half empty provincial theatres to performing at sold out large City theatres. They film recreates the duo performing scenes on stage from Laurel and Hardy's films, singing and dancing and of course slapstick. A good tribute of the biggest comedic film stars of the early years of talking pictures by two fine actors of the modern age.—bc1968 Laurel & Hardy, the world's favourite comedy double act, set out on a variety hall tour of Britain in 1953. Diminished by age and with their golden era as the kings of Hollywood comedy now behind them, they face an uncertain future. As they set out, crisscrossing the country, attendances are disappointingly low. But they've always been able to make each other laugh and as the charm and beauty of their performances shines through their audiences laugh too, and they re-connect with legions of adoring fans, old and new.The tour becomes a hit, but Laurel & Hardy can't quite shake the spectre of Stan and Ollies past; and long buried ghosts, coupled with Oliver's failing health, start to threaten their precious partnership. A portrait of the most tender and poignant of creative marriages begins to unfold as the duo, aware that they may be approaching their swan song, try to rediscover just how much they mean to each other."

Action Point,2018,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6495770/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A daredevil designs and operates his own theme park with his friends. D.C. (Johnny Knoxville) is the crackpot owner of Action Point, a low-rent, out-of-control amusement park with dangerous rides. Just as D.C.'s estranged teenage daughter Boogie (Eleanor Worthington Cox) comes to visit, a corporate mega-park opens nearby and jeopardizes the future of Action Point. To save his beloved theme park and his relationship with his daughter, D.C. and the Action Point staff risk everything to pull out all the stops.. The film starts with an old man named D.C. Carver (Johnny Knoxville) taking care of his granddaughter Rudy. D.C.'s daughter Boogie (Susan Yeagley) is doing to a wedding and is leaving Rudy with D.C. since she has a broken foot. The two watch TV and see an ad for a theme park called Magic Land, which Rudy thinks looks fun. D.C. tells her that he owned the best theme park ever in his younger days.Flashback to decades earlier when D.C. ran Action Point, a middle-of-the-road theme park with a staff of bozos like Benny (Chris Pontius), Stiv (Conner McVicker), Ziffel (Johnny Pemberton), and Four-Finger Annie (Brigitte Lundy-Paine). They don't do their job well, and the rides are pretty unsafe. A land developer named Knoblach (Dan Bakkedahl) wants to buy Action Point for his own gains, but D.C. refuses to sell.A young Boogie (here played by Eleanor Worthington-Cox) arrives from New York to visit D.C. for the summer. He wants to connect with her again despite not seeing her for so long, and also him being estranged from her mom for so long. Boogie likes the park and most of the staff, even seeing Benny as an uncle.A new theme park is opening nearby and threatens to steal customers away from Action Point. D.C. hatches a crazy idea to bring more people in by making the park as unsafe as possible without having someone kill themselves. They remove the speed limit from the fast rides, removes brakes from another ride, and they set up a ""petting zoo"" with animals like a deer, a raccoon, and a squirrel. After Knoblach stops by again and witnesses the debauchery, he starts to send his douche-bag son Travis (Matthew Peterson) to spy on the park. He is rude to a patron named Mia (Camilla Wolfson) until Benny comes to her defense. The two begin a relationship from there.In another attempt to drum up business, D.C. and the crew go to the town hall in disguise to pretend to boycott the park so that people will come due to the controversy (and promise of free beer). The plan works as dozens of young folks come from around town to screw around and get into trouble. However, an inspector shows up and determines that none of the animals in the petting zoo fall under a protected species, and therefore the park must be shut down. D.C. is pissed until they lure a nearby bear that loves beer into the park, thereby managing to find an animal that is protected, and letting them stay open.D.C. takes Boogie with him and the crew as they drive at night to a local news station where Mia works to try and leave a video for them to air. Benny sneaks in and tries to leave the tape, but someone working for the station arrives with his young mistress, and they go up to the tech room where Benny is, and they start to have sex. Benny keeps quiet until the man ejaculates on his hand, leading Benny to run out screaming before the group hightails it out of there. The video later turns out to be a commercial for Action Point, which once again succeeds in drawing in customers.A lawyer sent by Knoblach arrives to serve D.C. papers deeming the park unsafe after Travis injures himself on one of the rides. D.C. starts to realize the park may really be done.While D.C. tries to keep business afloat, he neglects Boogie and fails to take her to a concert for The Clash that she had been looking forward to. Boogie goes out with the park crew where they drink and wind up in trouble with Travis and his goons until the police arrive to sort them out. D.C. goes to pick up Boogie, and she pukes out the car. She is pissed at him for being negligent and decides she wants her mother's boyfriend to legally adopt her.D.C. ultimately relinquishes the right to the park over to Knoblach and his lawyer as a crowd of angry park-goers form behind the gate. D.C. signs the papers, but since the park is now in Knoblach's hands, D.C. isn't responsible for anything that happens. With that, he opens the park one last time, letting the crowd run loose and wild, tearing the place down, drinking merrily, and even letting the bear loose to scare Travis. One of the park's regular patrons punches Knoblach in the face and knocks him out cold. At the end of the day, the park is practically destroyed, but D.C. is happy that it went out like this.Boogie is about to return home for the summer, but D.C. offers to drive her back himself so that they can take a road trip and stop in Austin to check out The Clash. Boogie hugs him and says yes, while Benny and Mia decide to join them as well.Back in the present, after enduring a number of injuries that happened throughout the rest of the movie, D.C. finishes telling Rudy the story.

An exhilarating mix of dark comedy, white-knuckle action and dramatic intrigue, Gringo joyrides into Mexico, where mild-mannered businessman Harold Soyinka (David Oyelowo) finds himself at the mercy of his back-stabbing business colleagues back home, local drug lords and a morally conflicted black-ops mercenary. Crossing the line from law-abiding citizen to wanted criminal, Harold battles to survive his increasingly dangerous situation in ways that raise the question: Is he out of his depth - or two steps ahead?—Amazon Studios In the Chicago offices of Promethium Pharmaceuticals, co-presidents Richard Rusk and Elaine Markinson receive a call from a company employee, Harold Soyinka, who claims he has been kidnapped in Mexico and that his abductors are demanding a ransom of five million US dollars. One day earlier, Harold, Richard, and Elaine arrive in Mexico where they meet Sanchez, head of Promethium's Mexico plant. Unbeknownst to Harold, it is revealed that Sanchez has been selling Promethium's latest product, medical marijuana in the shape of a pill, to a Mexican cartel. Promethium has decided to cut them off to avoid harming their upcoming merger. Later that evening, as Richard, Elaine and Harold have dinner, Harold secretly records Richard's and Elaine's conversations while he is away from the table. He learns from the recording the merger plans, which would result in Harold losing his job. That night, he also discovers that his wife is having an affair and wants a divorce. Sanchez informs cartel leader Villegas about them getting cut off by Promethium; Villegas maims Sanchez and, believing that Harold is Promethium's boss, orders his capture.. In the offices of a pharmaceutical company called Promethium, we see the CEO Richard Rusk (Joel Edgerton) being interrupted from having sex from behind with his co-boss Elaine Markinson (Charlize Theron) by a phone call. Richard answers to hear his friend and employee, Harold Soyinka (David Oyelowo), crying for help, claiming he has been kidnapped in Mexico and that his abductors are demanding a ransom of $5 million.We go back to two days earlier where Harold is merely a mild-mannered rep for Promethium, living in Chicago and married to Bonnie (Thandie Newton). He meets with his accountant, who tells him that because of Bonnie's reckless spending, they are broke. When he gets to work, Harold is told by Richard that the two of them, plus Elaine, are going to be flying to Mexico to handle business involving a company merger, although Harold doesn't know that it's supposed to be a merger. Richard makes an allusion to a study he read on a gorilla being fed carrots when he wants bananas as a means for Harold to be convinced to go through with this so he will eventually be rewarded. Harold goes into Richard's office and finds a file on his computer that he copies to his own drive.Elsewhere in the city is a guitar shop run by Sunny (Amanda Seyfried) and her boyfriend Miles (Harry Treadaway).

Harold later gets the brothers to help him make a phone call. He calls Richard but is actually pretending to be kidnapped in exchange for the ransom, but Richard and Elaine cut him off because they are having sex in the bathroom, although they believe their business with the cartel is catching up to them and they are genuinely terrified.

Collin, whose felony was largely a matter of unexpected circumstance, wants to do the right thing and lead a straight life.

As a young New York couple goes from college romance to marriage and the birth of their first child, the unexpected twists of their journey create reverberations that echo over continents and through lifetimes in Life Itself. Director and writer Dan Fogelman (""This Is Us"") examines the perils and rewards of everyday life in a multi-generational saga featuring an international ensemble including Oscar Isaac, Olivia Wilde, Antonio Banderas, Annette Bening, Olivia Cooke, Sergio Peris- Mencheta, Laia Costa, Alex Monner and Mandy Patinkin. Set in New York City and Carmona, Spain, Life Itself celebrates the human condition and all of its complications with humor, poignancy and love. Life Itself is a generation-spanning story about love and loss that begins by following Will (Oscar Isaac) a screenwriter spiraling after his pregnant wife, Abby (Olivia Wilde), leaves him. His struggles affect his daughter Dylan (Olivia Cooke), who grows into a troubled young woman in New York City. Her life intertwines with that of Rodrigo (Alex Monner), a traumatized young man who grew up on an olive plantation in Spain. The decisions made by their ancestors ripple through the decades to bring them together.. Chapter One - The Hero (narrated by Samuel L. Jackson)The film starts with Samuel Jackson attempting to introduce us to the hero of our story. He first shows us a handsome gay man, Henry (Jake Robinson), as he is talking to his therapist, Dr. Cait Morris (Annette Bening). Sam is unimpressed with Henry's story, so he moves the focus to Cait. Afterwards, Cait is walking down the street when Will Dempsey (Oscar Isaac) tells her he's a big fan. Cait smiles in gratitude...and then she's hit by a bus. Sam then breaks the narration and appears physically to suggest that since Cait is the hero that she'll be fine... except for the blood pouring out of her head.This all turns out to be part of an ""unreliable Samuel L. Jackson narrator"" script that Will is working on in real life, and another narrator continues the story from there. Will then goes to get coffee and starts singing obnoxiously in front of everyone after adding alcohol and xanax to his coffee. He goes to therapy to see Cait, as he has been doing so since his wife Abby (Olivia Wilde) has left him.Flashbacks show Will and Abby's married life. She was a big Bob Dylan fan, and they had a dog named Fuckface (seriously). Abby was shown to be very pregnant before their marriage ended.Will tells Cait about Abby's history when she asks him to talk about Abby. Abby's mother and father met in college while she was eating a PB&J sandwich. Abby lived with them for seven years until they perished in a horrible car accident that left her father decapitated. She would go on to live with her Uncle Joe (Bryant Carroll), who was physically and sexually abusive to Abby until she got a gun from a friend and threatened to kill him if he ever touched her again, and she shot him in the knee to prove that she's not kidding. Abby found herself in college when she met Will, and he made the bold move to ask her out. Less than a year after they start dating, the two go to a Halloween party dressed as Vincent Vega and Mia Wallace (and they even recreate the adrenaline needle scene), and Will asks Abby to marry him. Abby has some conditions, specifically about wanting a dog before kids, but she agrees to marry him. They later meet Will's parents Irwin (Mandy Patinkin) and Linda (Jean Smart).On another occasion, Abby goes to Will to talk about her school thesis paper, and she wants to make it on the unreliable narrator, and how life is the ultimate unreliable narrator because of how tricky and surprising it can be.In the present day, Will wonders to Cait just how it went wrong with Abby. Cait mentions that Will was institutionalized following Abby leaving him. Cait asks Will to tell her about what happened on ""that day"". Will and Abby had just had lunch at his parents' house. They were walking down the street as Abby told Will that they were having a girl. Abby gets distracted as Will tells her he's a big fan, and Abby is struck by a bus. Inside, a little boy named Rodrigo Gonzalez (Adrian Marrero) watches as Will frantically tries to revive Abby. She died, but the baby survived. Will still blames himself for what happened. On impulse, Will pulls out a gun and blows his brains out in front of Cait. She runs away screaming to get help.Chapter Two - Dylan DempseyThe narrator mentions how Will and Abby's daughter Dylan (Kya Kruse) was born of death and tragedy, and these just seemed to follow her growing up. After being taken in by Irwin and Linda, Dylan loses Linda at age 6, and then Fuckface dies when she is 7. After Linda's funeral, Dylan asked Irwin if he would die. The two of them imagine the right things to say one another, with Dylan wanting to express her desire for a great life, and Irwin wanting to be honest with her, but they just keep it simple.On her 21st birthday, Dylan (now played by Olivia Cooke) is getting ready to go out. Her relationship with Irwin is a little more hostile, but she is shown to still care about him. She goes to a venue where she and her band, PB&J, are getting ready to play. Dylan tries to play a song and describe her feelings toward it regarding her mother, but some dickhead in the audience keeps telling her to take her shirt off until she throws a beer bottle at him. The band plays the song to an excited crowd.After the show, Dylan is making out with one of her band mates. Another girl records them, and Dylan gets up to take her phone and stomp it on the ground. The girl confronts Dylan to demand that she get her another phone, and Dylan responds by punching the girl in the face and fighting her until she gets pulled off. Dylan leaves the venue.Dylan sits down on a bench to smoke a joint. She passes out momentarily and dreams that she watches her mother's final moment. Dylan wakes up crying with the bus in front of her.

He brings in one man, Javier Gonazlez (Sergio Peris-Mencheta), for a drink. Saccione tells Javier a story of how his father was an Italian man who did not allow any Spanish being spoken in his home. He later impregnated Saccione's mother and essentially shunned the two of them. After he died, Saccione took advantage of the fact that his father left no will, and so he took his father's money and now owns the land. Saccione wants to be friends with Javier, but Javier prefers to keep the relationship professional, stating that he wouldn't have taken his father's money. Saccione offers Javier a place to stay so that he may oversee some of the land. Javier agrees.Javier goes to see his beloved girlfriend Isabel Diaz (Laia Costa), who works as a waitress.

He presents Rodrigo with a globe, and the boy takes an interest in seeing New York. Saccione tells Isabel how he feels it is late in his life to find the kind of happiness that Javier has, and he feels bad for intruding on their life, but Isabel assures Saccione that Rodrigo likes him. However, Javier disapproves of Saccione's visits and gives the globe back to him.Javier then decides to take Isabel and Rodrigo to America to see New York City.

Rodrigo watches the whole scene and becomes traumatized.Back home, Javier and Isabel struggle to take care of Rodrigo since he can't sleep and still feels the effects of what he's seen. They invite Saccione to come back and help the boy, and it works. Saccione teaches him English and helps him get better. Javier sees this and becomes envious, feeling that Isabel and Rodrigo love Saccione more than they love him. He confronts Saccione and asks if he loves them both, and he says yes, but he feels guilty about it. Javier makes the decision to leave, even though Isabel insists that she loves the life that she has with Javier. Isabel stays with Saccione, but she makes it clear she won't love him the way she loves Javier.Chapter Four - Rodrigo GonzalezRodrigo (now played by Alex Monner) grows up to go to school in New York.

At one point, Rodrigo travels back home when Isabel gets sick with cancer. Rodrigo wants to come back and stay with his mother, but she tells him ""Enough is enough"", and with that, they say goodbye.The narrator takes us to what is the most important day in Rodrigo's life. He wakes up with Shari, who says she is pregnant. Rodrigo becomes worried, even as she continues going on about it casually to the point where she almost gets hit by a cab until Rodrigo pulls her out of the way, but she doesn't notice and keeps talking. Shari then says it was just an April Fool's prank, but Rodrigo breaks up with her right then and there.Back in Spain, Isabel knows her time is running out. Saccione wants to call Rodrigo, but she doesn't want to say goodbye to him twice. Javier then arrives for the first time in years. The narrator reveals that Javier asked Saccione to write letters to him to update him on Isabel and Rodrigo. Javier spends one final moment with his wife.Rodrigo goes back to his dorm room and gets a call from Saccione that Isabel has passed away. Distraught, Rodrigo goes for a run throughout the city. That's when he runs by Dylan crying on the bench. He asks her if she is okay.Chapter Five - Elena Dempsey-GonzalezIt is then revealed that the narrator is Elena (Lorenza Izzo), Dylan and Rodrigo's daughter. She is telling a group of people in a book store the story that led to her life right now. Elena tells the listeners the last thing that Isabel told Rodrigo, and we see her saying it in English. She tells her son that although life may bring us to our knees, if we look hard enough, we will find love.Elena concludes her story by saying how one moment shaped her whole life, and that every bit of her has some of her mother, her father, and her grandmothers.The last is a brief clip of Will admiring a pregnant Abby."

Gosnell: The Trial of America's Biggest Serial Killer,2018,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3722234/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A movie about the crimes and trial of Kermit Gosnell, an American doctor and abortion provider who was convicted of killing three fetuses and the involuntary manslaughter of a woman who died during a procedure. This police/court room drama is based on actual information on Dr. Kermit Gosnell (played by Earl Billings) who for decades ran a Philadelphia inner-city abortion clinic. In 2010, Philadelphia Police Detectives Wood (Dean Cain) and Stark (Alfonzo Rachel), with DEA and FBI agents, raid the clinic for evidence of illegal prescription drug sales. They are shocked by the clinic's filthy conditions, bags of aborted fetuses in hallways, and fetal body parts stored in a refrigerator. Interviewing clinic workers, they learn: patients are given anesthesia by untrained assistants; one patient died on the operating table from an anesthesia overdose; abortions were performed on babies older than 24 weeks; and some babies were delivered alive, after which Dr. Gosnell cut their spinal cord with scissors. The detectives take the bagged bodies to the coroner and bring the situation to the attention of DA Dan Molinari (Michael Beach). An Assistant DA (Sara Jane Morris) agrees to prosecute the murder case. Getting a warrant, they search Gosnell's home for missing files and other evidence and discover a large amount of cash (the required method of payment for Gosnell's services). In 2013, the DA's office brings Gosnell to trial on murder charges. Gosnell hires an experienced defense attorney (Nick Searcy, who also directs the film) who defends Gosnell as performing a service to minority women. The DA's prosecutor obtains compelling testimony and photos from one of Gosnell's young assistants. The jury deliberates for 10 days before offering their verdict.—Judith O. Philadelphia Police detectives raid the Gosnell abortion clinic and find bags of aborted fetuses in the hallways. An Assistant DA decides to prosecute when she learns of a patient's death from improper anesthesia and the death of several babies born alive. Testimony from a clinic employee helps the jury decide on a verdict.—Judith O. This police/court room drama is based on the true story of the trial of Dr. Kermit Gosnell, an MD who for decades ran a West Philadelphia inner-city abortion clinic. The action begins in February 2010 when Philadelphia police detectives, joined by federal DEA agents (Drug Enforcement Agency) and FBI agents, make a drug raid on the Gosnell clinic looking for evidence of the sale of illegal prescriptions for controlled drugs. During the raid, the police detectives are shocked by the clinic's extremely unsanitary conditions, bags of aborted fetuses left in hallways, and fetal body parts stored in containers in a refrigerator and freezer. The detectives later learn that the State Department of Health had not inspected the clinic for years, ostensibly at the direction of the Governor so as not to interfere with women's reproductive rights. (Para) The DEA and FBI agents are concerned only about evidence of the illegal prescription sales, but the detectives refer the situation at the clinic to the District Attorney's office. An Assistant DA agrees to prosecute. Returning to the clinic crime scene, they learn that boxes of files have been removed. Obtaining a warrant to search Dr. Gosnell's home, they begin looking for the files and additional evidence. They find a large box with rolls of cash, which was likely the cash payments made by the clinic's patients. (Para) The detectives question current and former clinic workers about the clinic practices. They learn of the death of one patient on the operating table from a drug overdose and of untrained assistants giving patients anesthesia. No nurses or MD anesthetists work at the clinic. The detectives discover other violations of law, including abortions performed after the fetus/baby is 24 weeks old. Questioning clinic staff, they learn that some babies were delivered alive, after which their spinal cord was cut with scissors by Dr. Gosnell. The detectives take the stored bodies to the coroner's office, and the coroner determines that several of them had live births. (Para) A freelance investigative blogger provides additional information that helps the police and the prosecutor. She is the only journalist or member of the press in the nearly empty courtroom as the trial begins in March 2013. Dr. Gosnell has hired an experienced, forceful and effective defense attorney, who defends him for performing a service to poor and minority women seeking to terminate their pregnancies. The prosecutor obtains compelling testimony and photos from one of Gosnell's young assistants and brings in actual evidence from the clinic. (Para) After 10 days of deliberation, the jury convicts Dr. Gosnell of one count of third-degree murder in the death of one patient and three counts of first-degree murder in the deaths of three babies who were born alive then killed by cutting their spinal cord. The jury also convicts Gosnell of 21 felony counts of performing illegal late-term abortions and 211 counts of violating Pennsylvania's 24-hour consent law. The judge sentences Gosnell to three life sentences to be served consecutively with no possibility of parole."

"Juliet, Naked",2018,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5607096/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Annie (the long-suffering girlfriend of Duncan) has an unlikely transatlantic romance with once revered, now faded, singer-songwriter, Tucker Crowe, who also happens to be the subject of Duncan's musical obsession. Annie (Rose Byrne) is stuck in a long-term relationship with Duncan (Chris O'Dowd) - an obsessive fan of obscure rocker Tucker Crowe (Ethan Hawke). When the acoustic demo of Tucker's hit record from 25 years ago surfaces, its release leads to a life-changing encounter with the elusive rocker himself. Based on the novel by Nick Hornby, JULIET, NAKED is a comic account of life's second chances. Annie Platt moved back from London to her English seaside town of Sandcliff when her father became ill. Following his death, she reluctantly stayed to take over his job as curator of the local historical museum, at which she remains largely out of inertia. Since moving back, she has been in a long term relationship with Duncan Thomson, who moved to town for his job as a lecturer on movies and television at the local college. Annie quietly accepts the third that Duncan has brought into the relationship: American Tucker Crowe. Duncan considers Tucker the preeminent alternative rocker who never received his proper due. After Tucker released what Duncan considers his seminal album, ""Juliet"" - the songs stemming from a relationship with a woman named Julie - Tucker dropped off the radar completely. Duncan, who maintains a fan website and hosts a podcast for the few hundred dedicated Tucker Crowe fans, does research and speculates on what happened to Tucker, Duncan considering himself the expert on all things Tucker Crowe. The divide between Duncan and Annie concerning anything Tucker widens when Duncan receives one of the early studio recordings from ""Juliet"", which has been coined ""Juliet, Naked"". Duncan considers ""Naked"" revolutionary, while Annie considers it trite, arguably only because of Duncan's adoration of anything Tucker. This divide leads in part to Duncan falling into the arms of his new fellow lecturer Gina, who is more pro-Tucker than Annie, and Annie herself finding solace in someone she meets online through discussion of ""Naked"" on Duncan's website: Tucker Crowe himself. Beyond Duncan's infatuation, Annie ends up really being able to talk to Tucker about their struggles, which includes the reason why he dropped out of sight and the complicated nature of his life now. Her new friendship with Tucker may have a profound effect on her life, despite the unusual aspect of Duncan's infatuation with him.—Huggo"

Shoplifters,2018,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8075192/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"On the margins of Tokyo, a dysfunctional band of outsiders are united by loyalty, a penchant for petty theft and playful grifting. When the young son is arrested, secrets are exposed that upend their tenuous, below-the-radar existence. A Japanese couple stuck with part-time jobs and hence inadequate incomes avail themselves of the fruits of shoplifting to make ends meet. They are not alone in this behaviour. The younger and the older of the household are in on the act. The unusual routine is about to change from care-free and matter-of-fact to something more dramatic, however, as the couple open their doors to a beleaguered young girl. The reasons for the family's habit and their motivations come under the microscope.—aghaemi After shoplifting from a store, Osamu and his son run into a little homeless girl shivering with cold. At first glance, Osamu's wife is not quite keen to take her under her wing, but she eventually feels sorry for her. Despite eking a living from shoplifting, the family is happy until an unforeseen incident unveils a secret that puts their bond to the test. Couple Osamu and Nobuyo, their adolescent ""son"" Shota, and Nobuyo's ""sister"" and ""mother"", Aki and Hatsue, live together in Hatsue's small and isolated house in Tokyo. Although Osamu and Nobuyo have legitimate blue collar jobs, and Aki works as an exotic dancer of sorts in a men's club, they largely exist on Hatsue's deceased husband's pension and through shoplifting whatever they may need, in addition to Nobuyo stealing from her employer. Osamu's outward belief is that if something is in a store and no one has yet bought it, it doesn't actually belong to anyone and thus shoplifting is not stealing from anyone. Osamu and Shota do the bulk of the shoplifting of their day-to-day goods, their shoplifting M.O. which they have perfected to pat routine. On their way home after a shoplifting run, they spot a five year old girl who they have routinely seen huddled outside what they assume is her house, she as usual looking scared and malnourished. This day, they decide to take her home with them, in the process over time learning that she is Juri, an abused child. Ultimately, Osamu and Nobuyo decide to keep her, eventually changing her name to Lin and cutting her hair to make her look different after they discover two months after the fact that her abusive parents are finally looking for her. As Shota ends up being Lin's most frequent companion in he not attending school - Osamu and Nobuyo who have told him that only children who don't have the luxury of being taught at home need to go to school - he involves her in his routine shoplifting, the only life he knows. This new situation of Lin in their lives has the potential to bring this makeshift family come tumbling down around them as each person begins to question their past actions. If this figurative house does come crashing down, the alternative may not be better in the options of what is one's choice versus what is one's circumstance, the latter quite often biologically-based.—Huggo After one of their shoplifting sessions, Osamu and his son come across a little girl in the freezing cold. At first reluctant to shelter the girl, Osamu's wife agrees to take care of her after learning of the hardships she faces. Although the family is poor, barely making enough money to survive through petty crime, they seem to live happily together until an unforeseen incident reveals hidden secrets, testing the bonds that unite them."

The Sisters brothers have been sent to retrieve the formula from him, which he expects they will do by means of torture before killing him.

Hired to chase down Hermann Kermit Warm, an elusive prospector holding a pivotal secret, the lawless assassins embark on a challenging quest in peril-laden territory, unaware that greed and the prospect of immense riches will soon turn the tables on them. As two worlds collide between Oregon and San Francisco, can a change of heart threaten the mission's success?—Nick Riganas Set in the American West in 1851, brothers Eli and Charlie Sisters are gunfighters hired by a wealthy businessman, known as the Commodore. He tasks them to kill a man named Hermann Warm.John Morris, a private detective, has been engaged by the Commodore to track Warm down and hand him over to the Sisters brothers. Morris finds Warm traveling by wagon train to California with the Gold Rush and befriends him. They travel to Jacksonville where, unbeknown to Warm, Morris has arranged his rendezvous with the Sisters brothers. Warm finds Morris' handcuffs, realizes his true intentions, and threatens him at gunpoint, but Morris overpowers him. Warm reveals that he is en route to find gold using a chemical formula of his own invention; the Sisters brothers have been sent to retrieve the formula, most likely by torturing Warm before killing him. Refusing to allow an innocent man's murder, Morris frees Warm and the two leave Jacksonville. On the road toward San Francisco, Warm reveals that his ultimate plan is to create a utopian society, free from greed and other social ills in Dallas, Texas.Meanwhile, the brothers' pursuit is plagued by misfortune. A grizzly bear attacks their camp and mauls a horse, Eli almost dies from a venomous spider bite, and Charlie is repeatedly drunk and too hung over to ride. When they discover Morris' betrayal in Jacksonville, they follow the pair to Mayfield. At Ms. Mayfield's hotel and brothel, she denies having seen Warm and Morris, but offers the brothers a warm welcome. A sympathetic prostitute warns Eli of an impending attack, and he attempts to leave with a drunken Charlie, but they are cornered by gunslingers hired by Mayfield. The brothers kill the gunslingers and interrogate Mayfield as to Warm's and Morris' whereabouts, before murdering and robbing her.In San Francisco, Charlie and Eli argue about continuing their hunt. Eli wishes to retire but Charlie angrily rejects this idea. The next day, Charlie reveals that he has found a claim staked in Morris' name a few days' ride away. Eli agrees to complete the hunt as their final job.On the way to the claim site, the brothers are ambushed and captured by Warm and Morris, who are then attacked by Mayfield's men sent before her death to claim the formula for herself. The four men team up to kill Mayfield's men, after which Charlie and Eli agree to help Warm and Morris find gold in exchange for half the takings. Warm and Morris decide to prospect together and create a phalanstère in Dallas. Working to dam the river, the new partners develop a camaraderie. Eli reveals to Warm that Charlie killed their abusive, alcoholic father when they were young, and that Charlie's short temper and violent tendencies put him in danger, so Eli reluctantly took up their present employment to protect him.The dam is completed, and Warm explains that when his chemical formula is added to water, it causes gold ore to glow briefly, but is extremely caustic. The men pour the formula into the river and begin gathering the gold. When the glow begins to fade, Charlie panics and tries to add more formula, but spills the undiluted substance onto his hand and into the river. Eli rushes out of the river to restrain Charlie, while the undiluted formula badly injures Warm and Morris. The next day, Warm succumbs to his injuries while Morris shoots himself to end his suffering.Eli takes Charlie to the nearest town, where a doctor amputates his arm. Hired guns sent by the Commodore arrive and demand their surrender. Eli shoots them, and he and Charlie decide they must kill the Commodore. They arrive in Oregon City to find that the Commodore has died. During the brothers' visit to the Commodore's open casket, Eli punches the Commodore's corpse to verify the Commodore has indeed died. The brothers return home to their mother; though initially suspicious, she welcomes them in."

Based on the story, the film includes interviews with the foursome who attempted the bizarre heist. Starring Barry Keoghan, Evan Peters, Blake Jenner, Jared Abrahamson and Ann Dowd. The storytelling frequently jumps between interviews with the real people portrayed in the film and the events themselves performed by actors. In 2003 in Lexington, Kentucky, Spencer Reinhard is an art student who feels his life has no meaning, that he needs something exciting, even if tragic, to happen in his life to inspire greater artistry. Warren Lipkais a rebellious student on an athletic scholarship, though he does not care much for sports and is only pursuing the education to please his family. After Spencer is given a tour of Transylvania University library's rare book collection, the two friends begin to plan to steal an extremely valuable edition of John James Audubon's The Birds of America and other rare books. Warren travels to Amsterdam to meet some black market buyers who express interest in buying the books. Upon returning to the US, he informs Spencer that they could make millions of dollars, much to their excitement.. There was nothing in their backgrounds that would suggest that the introverted art student, Spencer Reinhard, and his rebellious best friend, Warren Lipka, would have the guts to attempt and execute one of the most audacious art heists in US history with the help of partners-in-crime, Eric Borsuk and Chas Allen. Driven by the need to spice up their dull, predictable, and ordinary lives in Lexington, Kentucky, and in the process, make millions, the quartet of amateur robbers summons up the courage to break into the library of Transylvania University to steal a rare first edition of John James Audubon's Birds of America, and once there, throw inCharles Darwin's scientific theory, On the Origin of Species. However, lacking resources and previous experience, the boys' make-or-break scheme is on a collision course with disaster.—Nick Riganas In 2003, four Kentucky college students attempted to steal millions of dollars in rare books from the school library. The young men all hailed from comfortable upbringings, and were primarily motivated by wanting to feel special.

Upon returning to the U.S., he informs Spencer that they could make millions of dollars, much to their excitement.Realizing that pulling off the heist will require more people, they enlist the help of childhood friends Eric Borsuk, who helps provide the logistics, and Chas Allen, who will be the getaway driver. They prepare for the job, learning that the only person guarding the books is the special collections librarian, Betty Jean Gooch.On the day of the robbery, they disguise themselves as elderly businessmen and enter the library. After noticing that there are too many people in the special collections library for the job to succeed, they abort the heist and retreat. Three of the conspirators want to give up, but Warren calls the library asking for a private appointment the next day.They drop the elaborate disguises. While Spencer acts as a lookout, Warren and Eric enter the library dressed as businessmen. Warren clumsily tases the librarian and makes Eric help tie her up and gag her.

All four manage to escape with two of the rarer books.They take the books to Christie's auction house in New York to get the authentication of value that Warren had said the Dutch buyers required. Spencer is told he has to return the next day and leaves his cell phone number with an assistant. In the van outside, Chas berates everyone for their stupidity, and they return to Lexington with the books. Shortly after, Spencer realizes that the police will be able to trace them from emails they used in setting up the heist as well as his cell phone number.The thieves show signs of great stress as they try to lie low: Warren attempts to shoplift from a grocery store; Spencer gets into a car accident; and Eric starts a bar fight. Inevitably, the FBI raid their homes and arrest them. Movie titles show they each were sentenced to seven years incarceration.After prison, the real-life robbers express their regret, noting how much pain they have put their families through.

Eric lives in California as a writer, and Chas has become a fitness coach in Los Angeles. Warren has re-enrolled in college and studies filmmaking in Philadelphia.

Some will succumb to the nightmare. Others will finally wake up. Susie Bannion is a young American ballerina who travels to Berlin to study dancing at Madame Blanc's Markos Tanz Company, one of the world's most renowned schools. On her first day, one of the students who had been recently expelled from the school is murdered. As this appalling happening does not seem to be an isolated occurrence, the brilliant new student soon begins to suspect that the school might be involved in the homicide. Her mistrust heightens when Sarah, one of the girls at the school, tells her that before she was killed, Pat confided to her that she knew and guarded a terrifying secret.—Domingo Alvarez Young American dancer Susie Bannion arrives in 1970s Berlin to audition for the world-renowned Helena Markos Dance Co. When she vaults to the role of lead dancer, the woman she replaces breaks down and accuses the company's female directors of witchcraft. Meanwhile, an inquisitive psychotherapist and a member of the troupe uncover dark and sinister secrets as they probe the depths of the studio's hidden underground chambers.—tlyonga American modern-dance prodigy Susie Bannion leaves behind her repressive upbringing and moves to a divided 1970s Berlin to join a world-renowned all-female dance company led by charismatic choreographer Madame Blanc. Unbeknownst to all but the most senior members, the company is run by a coven of witches, whose magic could empower Susie or destroy her.—mrosesteed Against the backdrop of violent political unrest in a perpetually gloomy 1977 Berlin, sheltered Mennonite and ambitious dancer Susie Bannion arrives at the prestigious Helena Markos Dance Academy, right after the mysterious disappearance of a troubled student. In high hopes of joining the legendary choreographer Madame Blanc's all-female dance troupe, Susie does exceptionally well at the audition, as whisperings of an unholy trinity of witch-mothers--Mater Suspiriorum, Mater Tenebrarum, and Mater Lachrymarum--threaten to blemish her proud achievement. Before long, yet another ballet girl goes missing. Could the Markos Tanz Akademie be a den of ancient witches?—Nick Riganas The movie is set in 1970s West Berlin during the German Autumn. The real-life events (the hijacking of an airplane by the PLAF and imprisonment of members of the RAF are reported on in the background).A teenage girl named Patricia (Chloë Grace Moretz) runs through the streets of Berlin to her psychologist's office. She is met by her psychologist, an old man named Josef Klemperer (Tilda Swinton, credited as Lutz Ebersdorf). Patricia claims that the instructors at her dance academy are witches and have been trying to take her body. Dr. Klemperer is clearly skeptical. Patricia then runs out of the office, leaving a bag of her belongings behind.Meanwhile, American dancer Susie Bannion (Dakota Johnson) gets off of a train in Berlin. She walks to the dance academy and says that she has been invited by famous dancer Madame Blanc (Tilda Swinton) to audition. She begins auditioning before two of the other instructors and, from several rooms away, Madame Blanc senses Susie's presence. Madame Blanc appears to teleport into the audition room to watch Susie. As Patricia has ""left"" the academy, they decide to admit Susie into their program.Later that night, the instructors meet. It turns out that they are, in fact, a coven of witches. The witches hold a vote on whether to replace their leader Mother Elena Markos (Tilda Swinton again in a third role) with Madame Blanc. Mother Markos is not in attendance, and its mentioned that her body is ravaged by disease. The majority votes for Mother Markos to maintain her leadership even though her plans led to the loss of Patricia. The witches note that Mother Markos has ordered them to try to complete the ritual they had been conducting on Patricia with another student.Susie meets fellow dancer Sara (Mia Goth), a teenage English girl who helps her move into the Academy. Susie learns that the dance academy has been open for ages, even throughout World War II, and all the students get free room and board. Susie displays immense raw talent and also, appears to intuitively respond to the powers of the witches.The instructors introduce Susie to the other girls and claim that Patricia left them to join the revolutionaries (like the RAF). A dancer named Olga (Elena Fokina) breaks down and says that the instructors are lying. As Olga leaves the academy, Madame Blanc asks Susie to dance a part and appears to somehow imbue her hands and feet with a kind of light. Susie launches into the role, unaware that her dance moves injure Olga, who has been trapped in a secret room. By the end of the dance, Olga's limbs are completely splintered and contorted, and Olga is barely alive. The other witches impale Olga with meat hooks and drag her down a secret passageway. Later on, the witches observe what Susie's dance did to Olga, how Susie couldn't have been aware of it and carried over more of their intention than they thought she would.During one practice, Susie begins dancing while Mother Markos is hidden below the dance floor (all we see is Markos' clawed hand beneath the dance floor). Markos deems Susie a perfect vessel for her to switch bodies with and orders Madame Blanc to begin preparing Susie for a ritual to take Susie's body for herself.Meanwhile, Dr. Klemperer begins reading Patricia's diary that was left in his office. He learns more about Patricia's theories that the instructors are part of a coven. All witches work in service of three ancient witches - Mother Lachrymarum, Mother Tenebrarum, and Mother Suspiriorum. According to Patricia, Mother Markos believes that she is Mother Suspirorum and she seeks a new body to maintain eternal life. Though Dr. Klemperer thinks Patricia's witch talk is pure superstition, he theorizes that the instructors are part of a dissident group. He calls the police and reports that Patricia has gone missing. The police go to the dance school but are put under a spell by the witches where they hallucinate seeing nothing suspicious at the school (in reality, at least one is in a coma and a few of the most nasty witches are shown being abusive). Shortly thereafter, we learn that Dr. Klemperer's wife (intimated to be a Jew) disappeared during World War II, and Dr. Klemperer has long wondered about her fate.Sara and Susie begin investigating Patricia's disappearance, learning that the instructors have eliminated all trace of Patricia (and Olga) having ever attended the school. Sara and Susie also grow closer, with Sara comforting Susie when Susie has nightmares that are given to her by the coven. Patricia reveals that she had nightmares too for about three weeks when she arrived, before she could sleep properly.At the same time, Madame Blanc begins bonding with Susie. She learns that Susie was raised in an Amish household and disobeyed her family by attending Madame Blanc's dance recitals when she toured the US. Susie's mom is dying, and Susie's mom tells the local clergy that her only regret in life is giving birth to Susie. Madame Blanc gives Susie private lessons, teaching her to overcome her dance limitations (and possibly transferring skills from other dancers into Susie). Madame Blanc and her supporters also grow more wary of performing the ritual demanded by Mother Markos.Dr. Klemperer approaches Sara and warns her that she is living with dangerous people (and confides in Sara about Patricia's suspicions that the instructors are witches). Though Sara initially refuses to listen to Dr. Klemperer, she eventually begins digging deeper. One night, she finds a hidden passage. She follows it down to a room filled with ancient relics and steals one of the witches meat hooks. She also witnesses the coven engaged in a ritual before fleeing back to her room. The next day, Sara visits Dr. Klemperer and tells him that all of Patricia's suspicions were correct and she gives him the meat hook she stole. The witches become aware of Sara's actions and also decide to punish Dr. Klemperer for his interference by making him a witness to their ritual to transfer Mother Markos into Susie's body (stating that the horrors of the ritual will drive him mad).The students prepare to put on a recital that appears to double as a pre-transfer ritual. Susie, of course, is the lead dancer. The night prior to the performance, Madame Blanc appears in Susie's room, and the pair has a telepathic conversation wherein Susie deduces that Madame Blanc loves her (like a mother). One of the supporters of Madame Blanc commits suicide in guilt and/or fear of what they are about to do to Susie.The night of the performance arrives, and Sara decides to search the catacombs beneath the school while everyone else is at the recital. Dr. Klemperer attends the recital. In the catacombs, Sara finds Patricia alive but in a withered condition (as though the witches have been stealing her life force). Sara also finds Olga having been driven mad and her limbs missing. As Sara flees, she steps into a hole conjured by the witches, and her shin is shattered (the bone literally sticking out of her skin). Some of the witches come for Sara, heal her leg, and put her in a trance so that she goes back into the recital. As the climax of the performance nears, Madame Blanc is told that the transfer will take place that night. At the climax, Sara's shin splinters again and the crowd runs out of the school in a panic. Dr. Klemperer is particularly disturbed as he saw that Sara's eyes had changed color and he finally believes that the instructors are witches.The girls (except Sara, who is whisked away) all go out with the instructors to celebrate the recital. All the dancers but Susie are put into a trance. Meanwhile, now fearing the actual power of the witches, Dr. Klemperer tosses the meat hook and all of Patricia's belongings into the river (trying to cut all ties with the situation). He turns around to find his wife Anke (Jessica Harper - who played Susie in the original movie 'Suspiria') standing there. Anke explains that she eventually fled Germany and through a series of circumstances, ended up in England where she remained ever since. The pair embrace and Anke slowly leads Dr. Klemperer to the school where we discover that Anke was an illusion. He is captured by the witches who chastise him for not doing more to help his wife when he had the chance and for throwing their meat hook in the river. They take him down to the catacombs where he will witness their ritual.That night, Susie awakens and follows a spectral light into the catacombs. She arrives to find her entranced peers dancing wildly, Dr. Klemperer weeping in the corner, the instructors in robes, and the hideous Mother Markos awaiting her arrival. Mother Markos is hideous, covered with tumors and boils. Susie descends the steps, saying she is prepared to sacrifice her life... for Madame Blanc. Madame Blanc cries out to Susie that she does not have to do this and that something ""feels wrong."" Mother Markos lashes out at Madame Blanc and severs Blanc's spine and neck. As part of the ritual, Sara is disemboweled while still alive. Mother Markos then demands that Susie kill her own mother (and casts a spell allowing Susie to do so) in order to complete the ritual. While contemplating Mother Markos' requests, Susie asks which of the ancient witches Mother Markos serves. Markos claims she serves Mother Suspiriorum. Susie smiles and reveals that, in fact, she is Mother Suspiriorum and strikes Mother Markos dead (likely for perverting the coven, abusing her power, and falsely claiming to be Mother Suspiriorum).Susie then summons forth the embodiment of Death. Death approaches each witch that supported Mother Markos over Madame Blanc and kills them (the head of each witch explodes when touched). Susie then approaches Patricia, Olga, and Sara and asks what she can do for those sweet girls. They all ask to die, and Susie kills them all in a gentle manner. Dr. Klemperer is then released, and the remaining witches are ordered to clean up the mess they have made.The next day arrives, and everyone acts as though nothing ever happened (the students appear to have had their memories of the prior night's events vanish in sleep). An announcement is made that Madame Blanc will no longer be able to teach at the school (and although Madame Blanc's neck and spine are severed, she still appears to be alive, likely revived by Susie). The remaining witches are clearly in service to Susie/Mother Suspiriorum.That night, Susie appears in Dr. Klemperer's bedroom where he is bedridden. She apologizes for the acts of her witches, stating that their beliefs had been perverted and Susie needed to gather the strength necessary to stop them. In a show of good faith, Susie tells Dr. Klemperer of Anke's fate. While Anke did try to escape Germany, she was apprehended and sent to a concentration camp. There, Anke died from exposure when the commandant forced all the prisoners to stand outside in the freezing cold while a ""census"" was being taken. Despite Anke dying, Susie lets Dr. Klemperer know that she was surrounded by prisoners who cared for her and that her last memory was of her first date with Dr. Klemperer and of his love for her. Susie explains that while many people must feel guilt and shame for their actions, Dr. Klemperer is not one of them.After the credits we observe Susie/Mother Suspiriorum staring at something off-camera and breaking into a smile."

Middle agedRicardo Trogicontinues to recount key periods of his formative years. This time, the year is 1991 and he's a twenty-one year old student in the screenwriting program at UQAM. Arguably, the two items foremost on his mind are having to deal with a genetic issue, and being in love with Marie-Ève Bernard, who he met the year before.

While grappling with religion, mental illness and a tumultuous friendship with French artist Paul Gauguin, van Gogh begins to focus on his relationship with eternity rather than the pain his art causes him in the present. The last two years (1888-1890) in the life ofVincent van Goghare presented, those years spent largely in southern France, most specifically Arles. He is driven by his art and what his art means to him, as opposed to the primary goal of making money, which he does not in not selling any of his paintings and thus being supported financially and emotionally by his brother,Theo van Gogh. As opposed to his friend and fellow artistPaul Gauguinwho has a modicum of success, Van Gogh is seen as less contemplative about his work due in large part to the speed at which he paints and what is seen as the haphazard style of thick strokes of paint on the canvas, but he is arguably more contemplative regardless of how prolific he is. That overall contemplative nature manifests itself more as madness, seeming or real, as demonstrated by an infamous act concerning his left ear.—Huggo During a self-imposed exile in Arles, France, Vincent van Gogh develops his unique style of painting.

A shy, insecure delivery truck driver accidentally arrives on the scene of a major crime and happens to pick up two bags of cash and hide them in his truck. As if interrogation by two tough police detectives isn't enough, the guy, who has a doctor's degree in philosophy which makes his mind mingle with remorse, must get rid of this dirty money. Only the help of a prostitute and a former biker released from jail might get him out of trouble, especially when a gang leader is very eager to get his cash back, or kill whoever is responsible for this mess. However, even the two bumbling detectives are monitoring the case as well.—RealLiveClaude With a Ph.D. in Philosophy in hand, Montréaler Pierre-Paul Daoust, from a working-class background, is an intellectual who believes that being one only gets in the way of happiness, emotionally and/or financially. That's why he feels stuck in a dead-end courier delivery job, and that's why he feels he couldn't make a go of a relationship with his last girlfriend, Linda Demers, or any woman, not knowing how to relate to them in a humanistic manner as opposed to intellectual manner. But that's also why he volunteers for a charity for the homeless. While making his usual deliveries, he stumbles onto a robbery gone wrong. Sensing an opportunity with one of the robbers and the security guard shot dead and the other robber having escaped to tend to his serious injuries before getting caught, Pierre-Paul, on impulse, grabs and abscond with the two large sports bags filled with millions in cash before the police or anyone else arrives on the scene. The business robbed was acting as a front for money-laundering by the Irish-Jewish West End Gang by Vladimir François, the head of his own gang. Not knowing what to do with the cash, Pierre-Paul ends up making associations with two people who fall on the illegal side of the law. One is Sylvain Bigras--nicknamed the Brain--just released from prison as a money-launderer for a biker gang. The other is a woman known as Aspasie, one of the most expensive high-end prostitutes in Montréal; he initially contacts her to spend some of that cash fulfilling his sexual needs, choosing her from her online profile because her name is associated with the world of philosophy. Especially in falling for Aspasie, who is all-professional in her business, Pierre-Paul has no choice within his nature but to believe in human trust in dealing with his new associates. But as the three of them try to figure out how best to deal with the money, they must contend with the police--Detectives Pete La Bauve and Carla McDuff--who suspect Pierre-Paul; La Bauve in particular needs to show his superiority because he's been feeling let-down in his position in life. Vladimir and the West End Gang will do whatever it takes to get their money--just ask young Jacmel Rosabert, the robber who was able to get away and who was only hired to do the job in the first place.—Huggo"

Laxmi makes his peace with it but gets worried on seeing Gayatri using a dirty rag during her periods. When asked about it, Gayatri tells him it's none of his business and he, being a 'pure' human should not interfere in this feminine topic. Undeterred, Laxmi goes to a medical store and buys sanitary pads for his wife which cost Rs.55. When he reaches home and hands it over to Gayatri, she reprimands him and tells him to return it as using such costly napkins meant cutting off milk expenses of a month. Unable to return it, Laxmi, crestfallen, goes to work where a worker gets injured. He immediately applies a pad to the injury despite the others referring to it as 'impure'. In the hospital, the doctor lauds Laxmi's quick thinking and says that it is the cleanest choice to stop bleeding.

While on duty and touring through the waters of the Red Sea, the Chinese Navy receives a distress call that local pirates are boarding a local cargo ship and endangering Chinese passengers and seamen on board. They immediately deploy the 8-person Jiaolong Assault Team as their forward unit to try to slow the progress of the pirates until the heavily armed naval vessels can arrive on the scene. Using the assistance of a forward helicopter and a sniper dispatched as part of the assault team, they make significant progress to stabilize the situation while awaiting the main Chinese fleet on duty in the Red Sea. During the operations, their sniper receives a crippling spinal injury from gunfire and must be replaced. The assault team is praised for their success once the main fleet arrives.Later, when one of the local governments on the Red Sea becomes unstable, orders are given to evacuate local personnel and workers from the mainland. Given the unrest and threats from local terrorist groups working the area, the Jaiolong Assault team is assigned the task of evacuating the Chinese citizens to safety aboard the main Chinese naval vessels in temporary harbor in the area.

As a result, seventeen long years after a botched undercover operation to capture the violent gang leader, Silas, once more, Erin finds herself on the warpath, hell-bent on settling an old score by reopening the long-forgotten case. Now, the ghosts of the past demand retribution, as Silas seems to have picked up where he left off. However, does Erin deserve redemption?—Nick Riganas Erin Bell (Kidman) is an LAPD detective who, as a young cop, was placed undercover with a gang in the California desert with tragic results. When the leader (Kebbell) of that gang re-emerges many years later, she must work her way back through the remaining members and into her own history with them to finally reckon with the demons that destroyed her past. Detective Erin Bell (Nicole Kidman) shows up to a crime scene, ragged and rough. There's a dead shooting victim with a tattoo of three dots on the back of his neck, purple-dye stained dollar bills around him. The cops on the scene say it's their case and tell her scram, but Bell tells them she knows who did it. She returns to her car and sits down, exhausted.At the police station, her boss tells her she's received mail at the precinct. When she opens it, there's a purple-dye stained bill inside. Someone has sent her a message. Angered, she goes to the FBI office to meet her old supervisor, Gil Lawson (Toby Huss). They catch up, and she asks him if he can trace the bill she received in the mail. He wonders if she really wants to go down this path, but he insists. He confirms it's a match. Erin leaves, ready for a fight. We see that she has tattoo removal scars for three dots on the back of her neck.In flashback, a much younger and healthier looking Erin meets Chris (Sebastian Stan). The two of them are being sent undercover to bust up a gang that's committing bank robberies. They go over their covers meticulously, and since they will be posing as a couple, they try out a kiss.Back in present day, Erin contacts a prison to get a meeting with Toby (James Jordan), an incarcerated member of the gang but is informed that he has been given compassionate release since he's dying. She drives out to his home and finds him decrepit and in bed, dying fast. She tells him she wants to find Silas (Toby Kebbell), the leader of the gang. He claims he doesn't know where she is but says he knows where she can find Arturo (Zach Villa), another gang member who's on the run. He won't tell Erin unless she gives him a hand job. She at first refuses but then does, disgustedly. Toby tells Erin that Arturo hides out in a church where he provides free legal advice to the needy, his way of giving penance.In a flashback, we see Silas, a sociopath leader of the gang, forcing Arturo to play Russian Roulette in front of the whole group. At this point, Erin and Chris's pretend romantic relationship has become a totally real one. In the present day, Erin goes to the church but finds it closed. She goes to have a drink and finds her own teenage daughter, Shelby (Jade Pettyjohn) there with her skeevy older boyfriend Jay (Beau Knapp). Erin tries to get Shelby out of there, but Shelby rejects her mother and Erin ends up hitting Jay, getting her kicked out of the bar.Erin goes to her ex-boyfriend Ethan (Scoot McNairy), who Shelby lives with, and tells him he needs to do a better job of getting Shelby under control, but he points out that she's not doing much to help Erin at all. The next day, Erin returns to the church, posing as a woman looking for help with a friend having immigration issues. She is led to Arturo, but once he sees her, he makes a run for it. Erin chases after him for a long while and finally catches him. She says she's not after him, just Silas. Arturo doesn't know where he is but knows who the attorney is that helps Silas keep getting his hands on the money from his robberies.Erin goes to the extremely wealthy home of DiFranco (Bradley Whitford), the attorney. She tells him she knows he's helping Silas, but he mercilessly mocks her, saying it's her fault that Chris and a poor bank teller died in her undercover operation all those years ago. Erin goes to hit him, but DiFranco's security guard comes from behind and beats her viciously in the stomach and takes her gun. Erin crawls into the bathroom, and when the security guard tries to get her out, she gets the jump on him, beating him unconscious, getting her gun back, and marching outside where DiFranco is coaching his son in a batting cage. She pistol-whips him until he's bloody, and he confesses he knows when the drop is going to be. He tells her it's not going to be Silas doing the pickup: it's always Petra (Tatiana Maslany), Silas's longtime girlfriend.Erin goes to the drop and sees the once-beautiful, and vibrant Petra is now completely strung out on drugs. She follows Petra's vehicle, hoping to catch Silas. Her current partner, Antonio (Shamier Anderson) has been continuously trying to reach her, but she brushes him off, saying she's on her own business. She follows Petra and sees her meeting with a bunch of men and putting on masks and loading up with guns - she realizes they're about to commit another bank robbery. She radios it in, pulls a shotgun out of her trunk, and along with two local cops who arrive on the scene, busts into the bank and stops the robbery in progress. A massive firefight breaks out, and Petra is hit in the leg but escapes. Erin allows the police to chase after her in the wrong direction, and follows Petra to another store, where she attempts to handcuff her. Petra fights back, getting in several brutal kicks to Erin's midsection, the same spot where she was beaten by DiFranco's bodyguard. Erin gets the upper hand and throws Petra into her trunk. She gets Petra away and handcuffs her. Petra is detoxing from drugs and begs for Erin to let her go, but Erin leaves her for the police to find - but not before demanding to know where she's planning to meet Silas. Petra tells her she never knows, Silas will text her, so Erin takes Petra's phone.Shelby has ended up in the hospital with a busted hand after getting into an altercation while out at a bar with Jay, so Erin goes to Ethan and tells him she wants him to take Shelby and move out of town somewhere else and start a new life. She promises to get him money - lots of it. In flashback, Erin realizes she is pregnant with Chris's baby. The two of them plan to go through with the robbery and keep some of the money for themselves to get out of the undercover life and the police life. They go over every contingency for how they'll explain it all to the police after it happens.In the present, Erin goes to a storage unit where she has kept a bag of money that has hidden away from the robbery all those years ago. However, when she opens it, she finds much of it has the purple dye over it, rendering it unusable. She screams in frustration. She takes the little amount of the money that is usable and meets up with Jay. She offers him the money to move away and never contact Shelby again. He is disgusted but ultimately accepts the money.In flashback, we finally see the bank robbery. Everything is going according to plan, and the vicious Silas tells the frightened bank teller she better not put any dye in the money she's bagging. The gang leaves with the money, but outside the bank a dye pack explodes, ruining an entire duffel of bills. Silas goes back in to murder the girl, and Chris, despite being able to make a run for it, turns back around to stop him. He identifies himself as an agent, but Silas shoots him and shoots the bank teller. When Erin sees Chris doesn't leave, she is devastated, and takes off driving. Toby is in her car and screams at her demanding to know if she's a cop. To escape him, she crashes her van, incapacitating Toby who she handcuffs. She takes her duffel of money and cries for Chris.Erin has dinner with Shelby, who recounts a memory of being a little girl and being pulled out of school by her mom and taken camping in the middle of nowhere and how erratic it was. Erin tells Shelby that she's sorry for everything, that it's her fault that her father died. Erin insists Ethan is the only father that matters to her. Erin tells Shelby she knows she's been a bad mother and she's sorry, and that she loves her, and maybe someday she'll understand. She kisses her on the forehead and leaves, finding a text from Silas on Petra's phone.Erin goes to meet Silas at the drop point. Silas is amused to see her and asks if she got his message he sent her (the dyed dollar she got at the precinct). Erin shoots and kills Silas, tossing dye-stained bills around him. We see the next day, the police investigating Silas's body - HE was the corpse at the beginning of the film, which is actually also the end of the film. When Erin tells the cops she knows who did it, this time we know it was her. Antonio wants to know what the hell she's been up to, and Erin gives him a note with an address and tells him he'll be able to put it together. She goes out to her car, the scene we saw at the beginning, and sits down. She lifts up her shirt, and she is deeply bruised all over with severe internal bleeding. Dying, she remembers when she and Chris decided to take some of the money. We see more of the scene: Erin is tired of their shitty lives, and she wants to escape. Chris is hesitant, but Erin begs him to do it for her. He agrees. We see another flashback, to Erin and a young Shelby on that camping trip. In the present, Erin looks out at the sky and dies."

Mandy then wanders into the woods and finds a dead fawn, symbolizing the death of innocence. Mandy tells Red of a time in which she was younger and almost peer-pressured into killing a starling. Upon reading a dark fantasy novel, Mandy begins to fear that something evil will happen to her. Upon traveling a road, she passes a truck with its passenger, Jeremiah Sand, eyeing her mysteriously.

Red instead seizes him by the head. Sand screams and even offers him oral sex so that he will be saved. Telling Sand, ""I'm your God now!"" Red crushes Sand's head into jelly before burning the church. He enters his car and drives off, imagining that he is seeing Mandy sitting in the passenger's seat, smiling at him.

Pennsylvania, 1993. After getting caught with another girl, teenager Cameron Post is sent to a conversion therapy center run by the strict Dr. Lydia Marsh and her brother, Reverend Rick, whose treatment consists in repenting for feeling ""same sex attraction.""

She attends Bible study and makes out with her best friend Coley (Quinn Shepherd) after school. At the homecoming dance, Cameron and Coley sneak away from the dance into their car where they smoke weed and start having sex... with Coley fingering Cameron. But they are interrupted when Cameron's homecoming date Jamie discovers them. Ruth finds out, presumably from Jamie, and distraught, decides to send Cameron to ""God's Promise,"" a religious gay conversion camp located in rural update New York for young people who ""struggle with same-sex attraction.""At the camp, Cameron meets the cheerful Reverend Rick (John Gallagher Jr.) who introduces her to her room and her roommate, Erin (Emily Skeggs), whose side of the room is decorated with Minnesota Vikings paraphernalia. He explains she will get decorating and mail privileges later on. He checks her bag, removing a cassette tape she brought, and makes her sign her contract with the facility. The students are known as ""disciples."" That night, Cameron dreams of the first time she had sex with Coley while they were watching a video, but is awoken by the staff's nightly flashlight checks into the room to make sure the disciples are in their rooms.The next day, Erin shows Cameron around the lunchroom and tells her about the other students. Erin is peppy and genuinely believes that God's Promise can fix her. She explains that Reverend Rick once too experienced same-sex attractions, but overcame them. On her first day of class, the director of the camp, Dr. Lydia Marsh (Jennifer Ehle) introduces herself to Cameron, welcoming her to God's Promise.Cameron goes for a run every morning, and one morning spies two other disciples, Adam (Forrest Goodluck) and Jane (Sasha Lane) sneaking into a cellar and smoking weed. Later, she has her first counseling session with Rick and Lydia. They give her a drawing of an iceberg, explaining that the same-sex attraction is the tip, but they need to examine the reasons underneath. They ask her to fill her iceberg out, and she goes and looks at the icebergs of other students, learning about how they ended up at God's Promise. Jane, a free spirit, catches her looking at hers, and tells Cameron to write whatever she thinks they want to hear. Cameron tells her she saw Jane and Adam smoking and asks where she got the weed. Jane tells her she grows it herself and invites her to join them sometime.While on a field trip, Cameron sees Jane steal a music cassette, and briefly decides to do the same - until she sees Erin spot her briefly. She puts the cassette back, but Erin insists on telling the adults, insisting she is doing it for Cameron's own good, trying to help her fight sin. Another disciple, Mark (Owen Campbell), helps convince Erin not to say anything and to keep it between them all. Erin begrudgingly agrees, and Cameron thanks Mark. Cameron begins hanging out with Adam and Jane regularly, going on long hikes. They share stories of their pasts, and Cameron wonders why they don't just leave. They explain that since their families sent them there, they have nowhere else to go - it's God's Promise or be on the streets. They also tell Cameron that Lydia is Rick's sister - she used to be a regular therapist until Rick became her patient zero. They ask Cameron about Coley, and Jane thinks it's unfair that Cameron is punished while nothing happened to Coley, but Cameron defends her.During a sharing group therapy exercise out in the football field, disciple Helen (Melanie Ehrlich) becomes angry because she feels Cameron isn't trying hard enough, which draws Lydia's attention. They press Cameron to talk about Coley, and when Cameron talks about how perfect she was as both a friend and lover, Lydia explains to Cameron that because she wanted to be like her, she confused it with being with her. Later alone, Lydia tells Cameron her success is dependent on her putting more work in.On another field trip, Cameron sneaks away and calls Coley, who asks if Cameron got the letter she sent. Cameron has to hang up before she can find out more. Later, a group of disciples is doing chores, and they change the radio from Christian music to ""What's Going On."" Cameron gets up on the table and leads her peers in a sing-a-long, but they are discovered by Lydia, who orders Cameron to come with her. She gives Cameron her mail, telling her she should read it. Inside is a letter from Coley, where she claims Cameron took advantage of their friendship to try to change her into a lesbian. It is here that Cameron realizes that Coley was the one who outed her and their sexual tryst to Aunt Ruth... not Jamie as Cameron assumed after they were discovered in the backseat of the car by Jamie. Cameron tells Adam and Jane all about the letter and wonders if Coley is right about everything and if she (Cameron) is a messed up person. Jane tears up the letter and tells Cameron to forget about Coley, who was a rat and in denial to her sexual identity. But Cameron is still shaken and calls Ruth in tears, asking if she can come home. Ruth tells her no, that she's doing this for her own good and that she loves her.After that, Cameron starts putting more effort in. She fills in her iceberg and begins working out with Erin regularly to Christian-themed exercise videos. She has a dream where she is making out with her teacher but is shaken awake by Erin, who says she heard Cameron making noises and knows what she was dreaming about. Cameron denies it, but Erin won't back down and then kisses Cameron. The two frantically have sex until climax, but the moment it is over Erin shuts down and retreats to her own bed, telling Cameron she wants to get better.At a group therapy session, Mark, who had been scheduled to go back home at semester's end, reveals a letter from his father who refuses to let him come him. His father writes that he is still too effeminate and an embarrassment to him and the entire family. Mark begins screaming and throwing a fit while Lydia yells at him to calm down. That night, Cameron goes to use the bathroom and finds it covered in blood. The next day, the counselors tell the disciples that Mark tried to harm himself but was found by his roommate Adam and taken to a hospital. One on one, Cameron asks Rick to tell her exactly what happened, and he confesses that Mark used a razor to cut his genitals and then poured bleach on his wounds. Cameron accuses Rick and the staff of not knowing what they're doing and making it up as they go along, and Rick cries and says he doesn't have a good answer for her.An investigator comes to check the conditions at the camp. Interviewing Cameron, he asks if she feels safe and trusts the staff. She says no, and when he presses for actual incidents of abuse, she says that while they may not beat the disciples, teaching them all to hate themselves is emotional abuse.Early the next morning, Cameron, Adam, and Jane get up and have cereal for breakfast. Rick sees them and wonders why they're up so early. They say they're doing a long day hike, and he says goodbye warmly. Once in the woods, they change out of their uniforms and hitchhike a ride in the back up a pick-up truck away from God's Promise. Finally free, the three teens smile and laugh as they head off into the future."

Wild Nights with Emily,2018,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5176580/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Dramatization of the little known side of the writer Emily Dickinson's life, in particular, her relationship with another woman. In the mid 19th century, Emily Dickinson was writing prolifically and in a passionate romantic relationship with her sister-in-law, yet she is still popularly believed to be a fridge recluse. Informed by Dickenson's private letters, this film is a light-hearted, humorous and bold take on the American poet who found herself facing male literacy gatekeepers too confused by her genius to take her work seriously, and instead attracts the attention of an ambitious female editor, named Mabel, who also sees Emily as a convenient cover for her bizarre love triangle. Note: this film is presented out of chronological order in a nonlinear-time line.Set in the 19th century, in her teenage years, Emily Dickinson (Dana Melanie) befriends Susan Gilbert (Sasha Frolova) during a recitation of the Amherst's Shakespeare Society, and during a scene in which they play lovers, a romance blossoms. On a stroll afterward, they kiss. When Emily's parents leave town for a month long trip, Susan stays with Emily for the duration. They continue to spend time together, concealing the romantic aspect of their relationship from others.When Susan gets a teaching job out west, they write countless love letters to each other's while she is away. When Susan returns, Emily is surprised to learn that Susan has been betrothed to Emily's brother Austin (Josh Griswold), which Susan had kept secret from her. Susan apologizes to Emily and explains that it's all part of a greater scheme: Susan cannot financially support herself without getting married, and by marrying Austin they can build a house right next door to Emily and no one will suspect their romance.Twenty years later in the 1860s, Emily (Molly Shannon as an adult) and Susan (Susan Ziegler as an adult) live next door to each other, and Susan's two children, daughter Mattie and younger son Gilbert, deliver their countless notes back and forth between the two houses while continuing to keep their romance a secret from Emily's brother and Susan's husband Austin (Kevin Seal as an adult). Emily shows Susan the poems she has written, some of which are written on scraps of paper and in the margins of recipes, and many of which mention Susan by name. Emily also likes to garden and bake bread for the neighborhood children.During a period when Susan is too busy to speak to Emily, a recently widowed Kate Scott Turner (Allison Lane) travels to stay with Susan. But Kate turns out to be more interested in Emily, and ends up staying at her place instead. Kate leaves suddenly, and Emily tells Susan she wishes she'd had a chance to say goodbye and give Kate the pair of garters she sewed for her. Susan is jealous because Emily never made garters for her. (Note: it is never fully explained of Emily cheated on Susan with Kate.)Emily receives the company of Judge Otis Phillips Lords (Al Sutton), a senile old man who confuses the Brontë sisters (describing the book ""Withering Jane""), falls asleep mid conversation, and calls Emily ""plain"". While on his way out he stumbles, and as the same moment Emily reaches out to help him, Susan walks in, catching them mid-embrace.A little later, Thomas Wentworth Higginson (Brett Gelman) also visits Emily after she writes about publishing her poems. During their three-hour long meeting, he corrects her on what the meaning of poetry is, describes how women's writing is different than men's writing, and even copy-edits one of her poems right in front of her. He tells her the poems are not ready for publication.Some time later in 1880, Mabel Todd (Amy Seimetz) first comes to Emily's house on an invitation to play the piano for Emily, but is surprised when the maid Maggie (Lisa Haas) tells her that she will play alone in the drawing room, and that Emily will remain upstairs to listen to the music while she writes. Mabel meets Austin after moving to Amherst, and they began an affair. They have little shame about it, and frequently appear in public together. They often go to Emily's house to make love, which Emily avoids by staying in her upstairs bedroom. Mabel suggests to Austin that they publish their love letters, but Austin finds that idea too scandalous and tells her to seek for a creative outlet elsewhere.In 1886, Emily suddenly becomes ill and passes away. Her sister Lavinia (Jackie Monahan) asks Susan to wash the body for burial. After her death, Mabel discovers a chest full of Emily's poems and letters, but she realizes that many of the best ones are addressed to Susan. She enlists the help of Austin to erase all the instances of ""Susan"" and replace them with men's names instead.Years later after Emily's work has become successful, Mabel gives a talk to a large group of society women. She tells them that because Emily was such an eccentric recluse, she only saw her face once: in the casket of her funeral. She explains that her poems must have been directed to Judge Otis, and that she added titles to all the poems so that audiences would know exactly what they were about. Emily's niece also gives a lecture about how her aunt and mother were secret lovers, but only three people attend.The film ends with titles explaining that recent technology has revealed Mabel's erasures and shown that the love letters were indeed written to Susan."

Monsters and Men,2018,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7689906/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The aftermath of a police killing of a black man, told through the eyes of the bystander who filmed the act, an African-American police officer and a high-school baseball phenom inspired to take a stand. The film is told in three intertwined stories of three principle characters: Manny, Dennis and Zyrick. The film begins with Dennis Williams (played by John David Washington) being pulled over by police but let go because he is a cop himself. The story switches to Manny Ortega (played by Anthony Ramos) trying to apply for a job, but hesitates on the convicted felon section of the application. Manny lives with his family including wife Marisol (played by Jasmine Cephas Jones), mother and daughter. Manny goes out to hang out with some of his friends when a cop rolls up near their dice game. In an incident very similar to Eric Garner's death, six police officers attempt to arrest Darius Larson, a friend of Manny's who sells loose cigarettes outside a small bodega. While unclear what transpires, a cop fires his gun and kills Darius while Manny is recording the entire incident from his phone.Manny, traumatized by the incident, returns home and re-watches the video. The next day in a newspaper, he sees that cops said Darius was reaching for their gun. While sitting in a park, Manny is confronted by two cops who attempt to intimidate him into not releasing the video. He tells Marisol the truth about the incident and how Darius didn't reach for the gun, but she cautions him to avoid any public disclosure because of his new job. Manny then sees a suspicious black vehicle outside his apartment that leaves when he gets close. Manny checks his apartment to make sure they didn't break in. Not willing to be bullied, he puts his video out on the internet for all to see.He sees the effects of this video in the press and out on the street. But shortly afterwards, he is arrested by the same cops who tried to intimidate him in the park. During his interrogation, they tried to pin a gun to Manny that they found on his friend Victor. The narrative focus then shifts to Dennis Williams via the interrogation mirrored window.Dennis goes out on patrol with his partner. Dennis asks Stacey (played by Cara Buono), a white woman, how many times she has been pulled over this year, and she says none, alluding back to the opening scene. Dennis is then seen interacting in a playful yet competitive basketball game with local kids, in particular Zyrick (played by Kelvin Harrison Jr.), but it is undercut by the fact they spit on the door handle. Danny and his partner are then called in to calm a protest happening at the bodega where Darius was shot by police. They are met with angry protesters shouting at them. Dennis goes home and watches the video of the incident.The next day, his partner Stacey brings up that internal affairs is looking into the case of the shooting of Darius Larson, specifically against officer Scala who was involved. Stacey seems dismissive of the entire incident, but Dennis thinks that reform is necessary and Scala is a bad cop. Later at dinner with friends, the incident of the shooting comes up as an item of discussion. Dennis becomes protective of the police as a whole claiming that they risk their lives, meanwhile Lisa (played by Cassandra Freeman) argues that a man should not lose his life over a cigarette and that Dennis should be part of the solution to get rid of corrupt police. On his drive into the station, he is told about two officers who were shot and killed on duty. During an internal affairs interview, Dennis does not speak out against officer Scala. Later, on Dennis' night patrol, Zyrick, the boy who was playing basketball with Dennis earlier, is detained by some other officers. While Dennis drives by, the narrative shifts to Zyrick who is visibly scared.After being released by the cops, Zyrick returns home where he and his father (played by Rob Morgan) live. The next day we watch Zyrick commute to his private school where he plays baseball. He is told about how recruiting scouts are going to be coming to his upcoming baseball game by his coach. On his way home from school, he sees some cops detaining another young black man on the street. Zyrick comes home and watches the video of Darius Larson getting killed. The next day Zyrick finds Zoe (played by Chanté Adams), who Zyrick has seen passing out fliers. Zyrick asks to help out with community activism and Zoe introduces him to the group that is getting ready for a protest against Darius Larson's shooting. A scout comes to recruit Zyrick at his home, but asks him questions about his character, making a lot of racial assumptions in his line of questioning. The scout indicates that Zyrick will be recruited, leading to the father and Zyrick to celebrate after the scout leaves. Later, Zoe and Zyrick then go visit Manny's home. We find out Manny has been arrested, and Marisol is pregnant with another child.After working out and training, Zyrick hears his teammates talking about the Larson shooting, casually mocking Larson for ""reaching for the gun."" Zyrick returns home to find a celebration in his honor, but he finds the party overwhelming given the protest scheduled that same night. He walks out of the party, and his father confronts him saying that Zyrick has a ticket given his talent. Zyrick nevertheless joins the protest. During the protest, everyone begins chanting ""I am... Darius Larson"" before they sit down and raise their fists peacefully. The cops tell them they will be disbanded by force and soon after the police start using aggressive measures and Zyrick runs away back home. The next day, Zyrick goes to his big game. The final scenes show Zyrick exiting the locker room wearing a t-shirt with the words ""I am Darius Larson"" that Zoe had given him the day before. As he approaches the field, the chant ""I am Darius Larson"" is overlaid in the background, before he takes a knee outside and it cuts to black.(Copied from Wikipedia)"

In the course of their comic and increasingly surreal adventures, Toby is forced to confront the tragic repercussions of a film he made in his idealistic youth - a film that changed the hopes and dreams of a small Spanish village forever. Can Toby make amends and regain his humanity? Can Don Quixote survive his madness and imminent death? Or will love conquer all? In Spain in the present day (people use cell phones, for example), a commercial is being filmed. This must be a major production, on the scale of a movie, and the cast and crew have come in from somewhere else. They speak English.This commercial includes Don Quixote, played by Toby.At a nice restaurant with the others involved in the production, Toby makes the discovery that the student film he made ten years ago, ""The Man Who Killed Don Quixote"", is available on DVD. He buys a copy and takes it to the hotel room where he and Jacqui are having a romantic relationship. They watch the black and white film while getting ready to do something else, but Jacqui is married to one of the people in charge of the production, and the husband is not happy to learn that someone is fooling around with his wife.Also, the black and white film changes to color, so the viewer is no longer watching Toby watch the film, but the events of the film itself. No, actually the viewer isn't, instead watching Toby discover the man who would be perfect for the role of Don Quixote in his film, and old shoemaker named Javier.

Angelica is apparently still alive, but Raul has kept her bedroom the same and mourns her because she has done something terrible.Toby and Javier have several adventures together. One involves a fire that starts by accident which Toby could have put out (though he would have needed a hose or something, and this doesn't even seem like a place that would have running water). Toby was not responsible and yet the cops think he is.Toby's adventures with Javier continue. As Quixote, Javier sometimes thinks Toby is his sworn enemy.Toby and Javier discover Angelica, who explains she became a model and now works for Alexei, a rich man who is described as being like a spoiled child who needs to be entertained ... and like Donald Trump. One of the people in charge of Toby's new production said that, as he hopes to advance his career by impressing Alexei with his spectacular attempt to entertain the rich man in his magnificent castle.And the fake Quixote who shows up and ends up being a highlight of the production?The audience for this spectacle includes Jacqui, and Toby has been struggling with choosing her or Angelica.The tone of the movie changes dramatically at this point. Already the viewer has seen that Angelica is treated cruelly, and yet she claims to be happy because look where she is living. And at long last, Don Quixote is no longer a comic character, but someone to be pitied.There's nothing wrong with the tragic events that follow unless the viewer was looking for straight comedy."

No matter what the cost, Vincent and Anton are determined to cut through America, only to find redemption at the end of their line, not through money, but through family and reconnecting to the land. In this modern epic, Kim Nguyen exposes the ruthless edge of our increasingly digital world. Cousins from New York, Vincent (Jesse Eisenberg) and Anton (Alexander Skarsgård) are players in the high-stakes game of High-Frequency Trading, where winning is measured in milliseconds. Their dream? To build a straight fiber-optic cable line between Kansas and New Jersey, making them millions. But nothing is straightforward for this flawed pair. Anton is the brains, Vincent is the hustler, and together they push each other and everyone around them to the breaking point with their quixotic adventure. Constantly breathing down their necks is their old boss Eva Torres (Salma Hayek), a powerful, intoxicating and manipulative trader who will stop at nothing to come between them and beat them at their own game.—Pierre Even It's late 2011. After securing financing from venture capitalist Bryan Taylor, cousins Vincent Zaleski and Anton Zaleski quietly hand in their resignations at New York City based Torres and Thatcher Corp. - where Vincent worked as a high frequency trader and Anton being one on the coding team - to embark on the top secret project of laying a 4"" diameter fiber optic cable in as straight a line underground from the Kansas Electronic Exchange Data Center to the New York Stock Exchange servers in New Jersey to increase the electronic trading speed down to at least 16 milliseconds, 1 millisecond faster than that currently exists, which would allow them proverbially, as Vincent puts it, to win the lottery even before the numbers are drawn. In the partnership, Vincent is the wheeler-dealer who requires anyone associated with the project to sign a legal non-disclosure agreement, while milquetoast Anton, who had to be be convinced to give up a steady job especially in light of needing to support a family, is the coding genius. Beyond their now former boss, cutthroat Eva Torres, becoming their competitor, one other reason for not telling her about the project is that she would probably consider much of the existing coding that Anton would be using as proprietary to the company, while Vincent would argue that it is Anton's intellectual property as the person who wrote it in the first place. Beyond some of the more obvious hurdles they potentially facing coming to fruition, one of the biggest arguably is Eva finding out, she who will do anything to ruin the cousins for abandoning her. Within this scenario, the project takes on a different meaning for each of Vincent and Anton as it progresses, Vincent who receives some personal news which taints the need for expediency, and Anton who is made aware of other aspects of the consequences of what they are doing.—Huggo Two cousins working at a High Frequency Trading (HFT) firm decide to set up their own HFT operation. To help their venture succeed they embark on an incredibly ambitious plan: to build a high-speed cable from Kansas City to New York. If the arduousness and practical difficulties of building the cable aren't already enough, their former employer is determined to wreck their project.—grantss Outdoors in New York City, Vincent Zaleski pitches his idea to investor Bryan Taylor. A major facility called KAX is located in Kansas, and people who want to trade stocks quickly could do so if an underground fiber optic line was built from there to New York City. To have the maximum advantage, the line would have to be absolutely straight, which would mean going through obstacles.In 2011, Vincent's cousin Anton is a programmer at Torres & Thatcher.At a restaurant, Vincent and Anton meet with Mark, who can build the fiber optic line.Vincent and Anton and Anton's family get together with the family for a meal. Vincent makes suggestions to his plumber father about how to do his job better, and Anton's young daughter sings while Vincent plays the piano.Anton and another employee at their firm have a meeting with boss Eva Torres about a plan for microwave towers, which will accomplish the same thing as the fiber optic line. Vincent and Anton realize their plan will quickly become obsolete but if they finish quickly enough they can still make money. Nevertheless, they have their first meeting together with Bryan, who is assured the plan will work.Mark and Vincent go to KAX and start trying to get permission from landowners. The man across the street is reluctant but eventually agrees to let the line cross his land.Vincent and Anton quit their jobs but Eva warns them that Anton cannot use proprietary information he got from working for her when he starts another job.Crews are hired, and the audience sees but does not really hear a number of brief scenes. Work begins at multiple locations.A headquarters is established and Anton's job is to shorten the time required for transactions from 17 to 16 milliseconds. This causes him a lot of stress and he keeps getting criticized even though he has to work very hard to get few results. As Anton later explains in a bar, the goal is for transactions to take place in the time it takes a hummingbird to flap its wings once. While this advantage will make them millions, Anton is asked what about those doing the hard work for those whose companies are making money from stock trading. Toward the end of the movie, Anton is more aware of these people.Eva has Vincent and Anton followed, and her detective is eventually able to take photos of a meeting. The photos show so much detail of maps that Eva is able to figure out exactly what they are doing and plan to stop them and do something better.Vincent gets sick, believing he ate something that didn't agree with him. In fact he has stomach cancer. He asks what will happen if he delays treatment because he can't afford to take any time off from the project. He is warned he is risking his life, and the best he can hope for if he gets treatment right away is a 50 percent chance of survival. Vincent keeps silent about his health and continues his work.One obstacle after another gets in the way. One crew quits after someone offers them more money. While the head of the crew refuses to say who, it is clear Eva found out and is trying to sabotage the work.Eva eventually discovers a paper written by NYU student Jimmy Tran which will help her get the advantage.While visiting one of the work sites, Vincent tells one of the people he is working with about how his father came to United States from Russia and was detained and interrogated because he was believed to be a spy.Nearly a year has passed since work began. Work continues in a very difficult section of the Appalachian Mountains. Any effort to go around the mountains will just slow down the transactions, so the crews continue to do the work at all costs. This includes getting permission to do the work in a park. When equipment breaks and Vincent is out of money, he must go back to Bryan and convince him to spend more money. Bryan agrees and work resumes.After numerous telephone conversations with representatives of companies selling equipment necessary to make the fiber optic line work, Anton has an idea that will finally reach the goal he is seeking. It is not a software solution, but optimistic predictions of the performance of the hardware.However, Eva visits Anton to warn him what happened to someone else who used software developed for her firm. She asks Anton how old his daughters are and how old they will be when he gets out of prison.The next obstacle is getting across Amish land. The Amish will not allow modern technology on what they believe is God's land and they insist that the crew go around.Worse yet, Vincent sees a tower that went up very quickly. What he doesn't realize yet is that it is one of many towers (the audience sees many of them in a short time), and he climbs a hill with a chain saw intending to cut it down. He passes out before he is able to do anything and ends up in the hospital. Eva's project is ready to go and will immediately make the fiber optic line obsolete.Mark gets in a dispute with the Amish when he says he doesn't need their permission as long as he goes underground by 100 feet.Eventually, the FBI arrests Anton on charges that he believes won't hold up. On a call home from jail, Anton is able to introduce a delay into transactions Eva's company is making. They can't fix the problem without Anton providing a solution, which he does, and Anton is freed.Bryan is angry about losing so much money and believes he will lose his company as well. Vincent had insurance in case of problems such as those he had, but the insurance company won't pay.Out of the hospital, Vincent is recovering at Anton's house and the girls are excited about the possibility of going out with him for ice cream.Vincent and Anton visit the Amish again. Before joining the others they have a conversation about the significance of life. It is raining and the Amish are loading moving bags into a barn. Both men help but Vincent tires quickly. Vincent tells the elder he has given up on his plan. The elder shows compassion when he realizes how sick Vincent is."

One day, Naina receives an offer to teach at the prestigious St. Notker's School, a job which she had applied to 5 times before.

A semi-fictional account, including most of the names of the players being changed, of the event that resulted in the creation of the term Stockholm Syndrome to describe people who feel empathy and sometimes more for their captor(s) is presented. In 1973, a lone armed man, thought to be American, storms the downtown Stockholm branch of Kreditbanken. Ultimately the authorities, led by Chief of Police Mattsson learn of his at-gunpoint demand: $1 million US, the release of convicted bank robber and murderer Gunnar Sorensson, and a Mustang Boss 302 like the oneSteve McQueendrove inBullitt (1968)as a getaway vehicle for the two of them. By the time Mattsson gets Sorensson to the bank - unknown to the gunman, who is thought to be well known robber Kaj Hansson, Sorenson having made a plea deal with Mattsson for his cooperation against the gunman - there are three hostages at the bank, all the others that were in the bank at the time let go. Arguably the most lucid of the three is bank clerk Bianca Lind, a wife and mother of two preschool aged children. Ultimately she is able to figure out that the gunman is not Hansson as Mattsson suspects, but rather Lars Nystrom, what she knowing of his past crimes chief being his humane treatment of people he held at gunpoint. Beyond what Sorensson decides to do with his ultimate goal not to go back to prison, what happens largely depends on Lind, who begins to trust Nystrom more than either Mattsson or Prime MinisterOlof Palmewhose actions and decisions she believes from what she can see are more of a potential physical detriment to her and her fellow two hostages than that of Nystrom.—Huggo Stockholm, 1973.

She begins a tangled love affair with three uniquely different men: one of whom she knows will be her murderer. An American writer arrives in London where he meets Nicola Six, a beautiful woman who soon becomes his muse.

A clairvoyant, she has premonitions of her own death, at the hands of one of the three men she is involved with.—grantss London, 1999. Blessed, or cursed, with the rare dark gift of clairvoyance, the cryptic, devilishly beautiful temptress, Nicola Six, is plagued by premonitions of death. Convinced that she is going to meet her fate on her 30th birthday and that the killer is one of the regulars of the noisy Black Cross Pub, Nicola starts dating three entirely different men: the blocked and terminally ill American author, Samson Young; the uncouth cab driver and aspiring darts champion, Keith Talent, and lastly, the wealthy and refined businessman, Guy Clinch. But, as Nicola effortlessly becomes the object of desire of all three men, more and more, her destiny calls. One of Nicola's suitors is a murderer. The question is, which one?—Nick Riganas Set in 1999 London, this noir crime thriller based on Martin Amis's novel of the same name features a star-studded cast, including Billy Bob Thornton, Johnny Depp, Amber Heard, Jim Sturgess and Cara Delevingne.Martin Amis' 1989 novel London Fields was a diamond-sharp slash across the face of his nation. Set in a then-futuristic 1999, it painted a portrait of a world plagued by an unnamed Crisis, where men behave badly and a woman, Nicola Six, waits for her birthday, when she plans to be murdered. The New York Times called it ""a virtuoso depiction of a wild and lustful society.""Wild and lustful, indeed. Scripted by Roberta Hanley and directed by Matthew Cullen, this adaptation splashes Amis' words across the big screen as vivid, palpable flesh. Amber Heard plays Nicola as a young woman already world-weary. She's so anxious about her declining power over men as she ages that engineering her own death seems like the wise choice. She does her best to manipulate petty criminal Keith Talent (Jim Sturgess) and dangerously bored millionaire Guy Clinch (Theo James) toward the deed. When American novelist Samson Young (Billy Bob Thornton) discovers Nicola's story, it feels like an instant cure for his writer's block.Featuring cinematography by Guillermo Navarro (Pan's Labyrinth, Jackie Brown) and production design by Jeremy Reed (Factory Girl), London Fields wraps its characters in an intoxicating swirl of post-punk, grotty glamour. It suits them. Nicola, Keith, Guy, and Samson scheme to take what they can from each other, fueled by Guy's money, Samson's perverse sense of drama, and everybody's lust. And in London Fields, everybody really means everybody. The terrific ensemble cast includes Cara Delevingne, Gemma Chan, Jaimie Alexander - and a hello to Jason Isaacs."

Alarm dispatcher Asger Holm answers an emergency call from a kidnapped woman. When the call is suddenly disconnected, the search for the woman and her kidnapper begins. With the phone as his only tool, Asger enters a race against time to save the endangered woman. But soon he realizes that he is dealing with a crime that is far bigger than he first thought. Police officer Asger Holm (Cedergren), demoted to desk work as an alarm dispatcher, answers a call from a panicked woman who claims to have been kidnapped. Confined to the police station and with the phone as his only tool, Asger races against time to get help and find her. After 12 years of service, demoted Copenhagen police constable Asger Holm finds himself stuck at an Emergency Services station answering distress calls. With cold detachment, Asger deals with routine calls until he becomes embroiled in a nail-biting, race-against-time investigation when desperate abduction victim Iben calls in seeking help. And driven by a strong sense of duty, Holm keeps his ears open for vital pieces of information only to become obsessed with single-handedly saving the kidnapped woman. Above all else, Asger is determined to bring Iben back safely--an honourable but unwise decision that will change his life forever.—Nick Riganas Police officer Asger Holm begins his afternoon shift at the police station. He has been temporarily relegated to telephone duty, but he is happy that today will be the last day before he can resume his normal patrol duty again. The first calls start coming in. After calming down out a man who clearly calls in a simple drug-induced panic, the next case is a man who claims to have been robbed in the red light district. Asger calls out to the nearest police station for assistance, and is surprised to hear his boss Bo, who is currently doing a phone duty there. They have a some fun over the man who was obviously robbed by the prostitute he had just hired for sex, and Bo promises to send out a patrol car for him. Asger asks if Rashid is all right; Bo acknowledges, but sounds puzzled by the question, as if there should be something wrong with Rashid.Asger then receives a call from a journalist on his mobile phone who wants to ask him questions about his hearing tomorrow. Asger is taken by surprise and cuts her off, stating that he has no comment on the subject. His chef scolds him for answering personal calls in the call center area, but he replies that he thought it was for work.Asger is visibly shaken by the call, and nearly misses his next one. It is a woman called Iben, who sounds like she is in for small talk, but she is pretending to be talking to her child. From her tone, it is clear that she is under duress. Through a series of closed-ended questions, Asger is able to find out that she is being taken against her will by a man who is possibly armed with a knife. They are driving on the freeway in northern direction in a white van. Asger calls dispatch and asks them to send a police car to look out for the vehicle. Unfortunately he is unable to provide them with the license plate number. Asger switches the call back to Iben, telling her to be ready to signal the police, who are looking out for the car. However, the call is suddenly broken off. Asger calls dispatch again and is patched through to the unit that is driving over the freeway in search of the van. Due to the rain, the officers on the phone have a hard time identifying it, but when they find one, they force it to pull over. Asger listens in as the officers close in on the van, but it is a false alarm: there is no woman in the van. There is no sight of the actual vehicle.Asger tries calling Iben back but her phone is not answered. Through Iben's phone record, Asger finds out her address and home phone number. He calls it and a 6-year-old girl called Mathilde answers. She sounds very anxious as she tells that she lives with her mother and baby brother Oliver. Her father, ""Michael"", no longer lives with them, but he had showed up earlier that day in an agitated state. He was yelling to Oliver and then left with Iben, leaving both kids alone at home, telling the girl to let her brother sleep. Mathilde fears for her mother, so to calm her down, Asger tells her his name and assures her that the police are looking for her parents. He promises her that her mother will be returned safe and unharmed, and tells her to stay with her baby brother. He will make sure that a police unit is sent, and tells her to call again for him if she needs to.Through police records, Asger finds out that Michael has a history of violent behavior, and has been in jail for domestic abuse. He also finds out Michael's address, and that he drives a white van. He calls dispatch and gives them the license plate number to look for. He asks the officer on the line to send a unit to Iben's children who are alone. He also tells them to go to Michael's house and check it, breaking in if necessary, but the officer sternly tells him that this is not their job. Asger gets assurance from the officer that a car will be sent to the children.Asger's apprehension is noted by one of his colleagues, but he assures him that everything is all right. He apologizes to the man for his behavior of the past weeks, including today, before moving into a phone room separate from the call center area, where he is allowed to make personal phone calls. Iben's phone is still unanswered, so he calls Michael's listed cell phone number. Asger identifies himself as a police officer, stating that they received word that his children are home alone. Since their mother cannot be reached, he is telling Michael to go to their address and check up on his kids. Michael sounds preoccupied, clearly hiding something, and says that he is currently unable to do so. Asger decides to level with him, stating that they know he kidnapped Iben, and that the game is over. He instructs Michael to stop and wait for a police car to arrest him. Michael suddenly disconnects the call.A colleague comes in, telling that their shift is over and the night team has arrived, but Asger says that he wants to finish something, closing all the blinds in the room. He calls Bo again, explaining the situation and urging him to send someone to Michael's house, because there may be clues there about where Michael is taking Iben, but Bo reprimands him for deviating from official procedures. He tells Asger to let the police look for the van, and everything will be okay; he should go home to his wife. Bo has already hung up and doesn't hear Asger say that his wife has left him.Asger then calls Rashid on the phone, asking him for a favor and check a certain address. Rashid is happy to comply, but Asger is dismayed to hear that Rashid has been drinking a few beers at an office party. Rashid is supposed to give testimony in Asger's defense tomorrow, and cannot show up with a hangover. Rashid confesses to be nervous about the story that they have agreed to tell, fearing that he may not get the details right. Asger tells him that it is okay not to lie if he doesn't want to, but this agitates Rashid, who says that he cannot suddenly change the story that he has stuck to all those months. Asger calms him down and asks him to go to an address, promising to update him on what to do when he arrives.One of Asger's colleagues comes in and says that there is a little girl on the phone who wants to talk to him specifically. Taking the transferred call, he hears Mathilde saying that there are two police officers at her door. Asger urges her to let them in and give the phone to one of them. Asger talks to the officer, who says that Mathilde has blood on her hands and clothes. Asger tells him to hurry and search the place, because there is supposed to be a baby unattended. After a while, the officer comes back to the phone, saying that the baby is dead. Asger urges him to check for breathing, but the officer tells him there is no need, as the baby has been cut open with a knife. Asger tells the shocked officer not to let Mathilde in the room, but it is already too late, as he hears the little girl scream before the call is disconnected.Asger takes some time to process this news, and tries Michael's cell phone again. Michael answers, and Asger confronts him with what he just learned. Michael seems to dodge the issue, yelling that Asger doesn't understand, so Asgar loses his temper and says that dangerous guys like him deserve a bullet. Once again, the call gets disconnected. Asger tries Iben's cell phone again. She answers, again pretending to talk to her daughter. Asger finds out that they are still driving and neither is wearing a seat belt. He tells her to fasten her belt. She does, which raises suspicion with Michael, so Asger commands Iben to pull the hand brake immediately. There is some commotion on the other end of the line, and the call gets disconnected again.Asger gets another call on his own cell. It is Rashid, who has arrived on the address. Asger brings him up to speed, saying it is the address of a suspect in a kidnap case, and they need to go in and find some kind of clue as to where the kidnapper may be taking the hostage, such as a vacation address. Rashid finds the door open, indicating Michael left in a hurry. The interior is sparsely decorated, with only a mattress on the floor and a pile of paperwork on a table. Asger tells him to go through the papers in search of clues over Rashid's objections that this will take too long, as they simply have no alternatives left.Asger tries Iben's cell again. She answers, but she is very shocked and confused. She is still inside the driving van, but it is dark, leading Asger to conclude that Michael has locked her in the back of the van. Iben is very frightened, saying that she doesn't want to get locked up. Asger calms her down and tells her that she may need to defend herself from Michael as soon as he stops the van. Since Michael is a mason, Asger deduces that there must be some tools in the back, so he tells Iben to search around. She finds a brick, but when Asger tells her to hit Michael with it as hard as she can as soon as he opens the door, she gets into a panic again. Asger tries to distract her and asks her to tell something about her life. Iben tells her how she loves to take the children to the big city aquarium, because the gliding fish calm her down, especially her son Oliver who cries a lot. She says that she was finally able to calm him down today when she got rid of the snakes. Asger is puzzled, and asks what she means by that. Iben says that Oliver had snakes writhing in his belly, and he finally stopped crying when she cut them out of him. Before he can say anything, Asger hears the van stop and Michael opening the door. He shouts to Iben not to assault Michael, but it is too late: there are sounds of struggle, and the call gets disconnected.Utterly shocked, Asger receives another call from Rashid. He has gone through the paperwork and has found evidence of custody battles, as well as proof that Iben has been committed to a mental hospital before. Asger checks a map of the area, and finds that the mental hospital is on the route that Michael has been taking. Suddenly, he starts making sense of Iben's fear of ""getting locked up"".Intensely frustrated, Asger breaks several objects on his desk. He tries Michael's cell phone again. Michael is just regaining consciousness, barely having any notion of what hit him. Iben has fled. Asger tells Michael that he has learned the shocking truth, that Iben inadvertently killed Oliver, and expresses his regret of not assessing the situation properly. Michael is agitated, saying that he already knew that Iben could be a danger to the kids and herself, and needed psychiatric help. He had reached out to every institution, but no one would help. Asger tells him to stay put and wait for a police car to pick him up.A colleague of the night shift then comes in, telling him there is a woman called Iben on the line for him. He takes the call in the call center. Iben has come to her senses, she is now near a bridge. Asker calls in her position to dispatch. Iben asks Asger if she has murdered her own son. Asger tries to dodge the answer, but Iben asks him not too lie. Finally realizing what she has done, she tells Asger that she is on top of a bridge. He can hear her climbing the railing, waiting to jump to her death, so to stall her, he tells her that she is not the only one with snakes. He confesses to have killed someone on the job, a young man of barely 19 years. The man had done something terrible, and Asger, sick of the thought of such a person getting away easily, shot him on the site. Together with his partner, he fabricated a story that the victim attacked him, and that he acted in self-defense. After a silence, Asger can hear the sirens of the police through the phone, but Iben seems ready to say her final goodbye. Asger makes one final attempt to get through to her, but the phone abruptly disconnects. Seconds pass, as dispatch calls in: the police unit was able to take her in, alive and well.Under the confused looks of his colleagues, Asger gets up and walks towards the exit of the building, getting his phone out to make one final phone call."

Sunset,2018,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5855772/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A young girl grows up to become a strong and fearless woman in Budapest before World War I. 1913, Budapest, in the heart of Europe. The young Irisz Leiter arrives in the Hungarian capital with high hopes to work as a milliner at the legendary hat store that belonged to her late parents. She is nonetheless sent away by the new owner, Oszkár Brill. While preparations are under way at the Leiter hat store, to host guests of uttermost importance, a man abruptly comes to Irisz, looking for a certain Kálmán Leiter. Refusing to leave the city, the young woman follows Kálmán's tracks, her only link to a lost past. Her quest brings her through the dark streets of Budapest, where only the Leiter hat store shines, into the turmoil of a civilization on the eve of its downfall. Set in Budapest in 1913, when the city was considered to be at the heart of Europe. 20-year-old Irisz Leiter (Juli), arrives in the Hungarian capital after spending her younger years in an orphanage, hoping to work as a milliner in the legendary hat store that belonged to her late parents. She is suddenly confronted with her past and starts searching for answers about her family before stumbling upon dark secrets. Írisz Leiter's family had an upscale milliner's boutique in Budapest, but her parents were killed in an unspecified accident when she was 2 years old. In 1913, after living in Trieste, Írisz arrives back to Budapest as an adult and tries and finally manages to gain employment as a milliner in the Leiter boutique, now run by Mr. Brill. Írisz quickly finds out (after a mad coachman called Gaspar breaks into her room at night) that she has an elder brother called Kálmán, who is in hiding and is wanted for the murder of an aristocrat, one Count Rédey. No one is eager to talk about Kálmán in the boutique because the murder scandal is obviously bad for business. A mysterious bearded man also approaches Irisz on the street and tells her to forget about Kálmán and leave Budapest. Still determined to find out more, Írisz visits the widowed Countess Rédey who is an opium addict and is abused and manipulated by the sadistic Viennese aristocrat von König, an acquaintance of Mr. Brill. She deduces that Count Rédey was also abusive towards the Countess and Kálmán probably killed him for a reason.Then Írisz tracks down the coachman Gaspar to a factory complex on the outskirts of the city and in addition to Gaspar, finds a gang of anarchists having a meeting nearby. Although she doesn't manage to get in to their club as it is for men only, it is revealed that the anarchists are led by her brother Kálmán (who was the mysterious bearded man she saw earlier) and are planning to raid the Rédey estate during a party to kill or capture von König. As the anarchists take off in horse coaches Írisz goes to the Rédey estate where the attack soon commences. However, the anarchists mainly concentrate on robbing people's jewelry and harassing women. Kálmán enters the upper floors of the palace brandishing a Mauser pistol but accidentally shoots the Countess instead of von König, who escapes easily. Kálmán sees Írisz and takes her back to his hideout on an island, tells her that Mr. Brill is soliciting his female employees for sadistic purposes for the upper class and forbids her to leave. Early in the morning she however steals a rowing boat and escapes. Kálmán swims after her but she hits him with an oar, knocking him unconscious and presumably causing him to drown.In the Leiter boutique, the 30th anniversary celebrations for the boutique are under way and even the Princess of the Imperial Family (Zita of Bourbon-Parma, presumably) visits the store. Not trusting her brother, Írisz goes back to the boutique and warns Mr. Brill that the anarchists are probably going to attack the boutique next, that she saw the massacre at the Rédey estate and that she accidentally killed Kálmán. Brill dispatches private detectives to apprehend the anarchists and protect the boutique and the celebrations. Írisz hears that Brill will be organizing a ball in which one his female workers will be chosen for work in the Imperial Court in Vienna. She also learns that other girls from the boutique have been chosen for such work throughout the years and their fate may be more sinister. She finds one of them, Fanni, living in a poorhouse in Budapest, with her face disfigured. Írisz also catches a glimpse of her brother (imaginary or not), who is alive and well, in a fun fair and becomes disconcerted.Brill forbids Írisz to attend the ball and she is thrown out when she tries to sneak in. Unsuprisingly, the sadistic von König is among the aristocrats attending the ball. Next morning it is revealed that the boutique's supervisor, Miss Zelma, has been chosen and is about to leave. Írisz gets into the coach waiting for Zelma in her stead and is driven to a palace, alongside the hats ordered by the Princess earlier. There, the Imperial Prince (future Charles I of Austria, no doubt) waits for her with various aristocrats. For some reason, they are all barefooted. Suddenly the men start to act strangely and harass Írisz and after a servant opens a door to a dark chamber and proclaims it is ""time to start"", Írisz tries to escape. She is apprehended but in the meantime Mr. Brill and Zelma have also arrived to the palace and explain the mix-up. Brill takes Írisz back to the boutique with him and leaves Zelma for the perverted aristocrats. Brill is furious and tells Írisz, who tries to confront him, that she must leave the next day, after the final night of celebrations. Írisz learns that the anarchists are on the move and escapes her room dressed as a man. She goes back to anarchists' club near the factory and is let in this time but the anarchists are already leaving, armed to the teeth. She boards the coach of Kálmán's anarchist associate who doesn't answer when she asks him if Kálmán is alive or not. When they arrive at the boutique it is already on fire and rioting goes on all around them. Írisz sees Mr. Brill upstairs and enters the boutique, where von König threatens her with a pistol, only to be shot by someone. Upstairs, she hears someone running off and when she finds Mr. Brill, he is already dead. She looks out of window and the anarchists cheer at her, chanting ""Leiter! Leiter! Leiter!"". She walks out of the burning building.In the last scene, the camera moves along a trench filled with Austro-Hungarian soldiers in one long take.

The House That Jack Built,2018,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4003440/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The story follows Jack, a highly intelligent serial killer, over the course of twelve years, and depicts the murders that really develop his inner madman. USA in the 1970s. We follow the highly intelligent Jack over a span of 12 years and are introduced to the murders that define Jack's development as a serial killer. We experience the story from Jack's point of view, while he postulates that each murder is an artwork in itself. As the inevitable police intervention is drawing nearer, he is taking greater and greater risks in his attempt to create the ultimate artwork. Along the way we experience Jack's descriptions of his personal condition, problems and thoughts through a recurring conversation with the unknown Verge--a grotesque mixture of sophistry mixed with an almost childlike self-pity and psychopathic explanations. The House That Jack Built is a dark and sinister story, yet presented through a philosophical and occasional humorous tale.—Zentropa Entertainments Reflecting on his existence, disturbed Jack, a failed architect and sadistic serial killer, drones on about his twelve-year reign of terror to Verge, his unseen, enigmatic companion. To illuminate the significance of his systematic atrocities, Jack recounts five defining, randomly chosen incidents from his busy, blood-spattered life, making sure to include every single detail of his elaborate, revolting murders. But in Jack's eyes, these grisly killings are works of art. What will it take to create his magnum opus and end his brutal career with a bang?—Nick Riganas Jack is a quiet, seemingly-harmless architect, working on building his dream house. One day, in a fit of annoyance and anger, he kills a woman to whom he had reluctantly given a lift. He discovers that he enjoys killing, and over the next 12 years he goes on a killing spree.—grantss Jack, a prolific serial killer and failed architect in 1980s Washington, recounts five of his crimes to Virgil-whom he refers to as Verge-as Verge leads Jack through the nine circles of Hell. Each of Jack's crimes, depicted through flashback, feature commentary from both Jack and Verge, as Jack attempts to expound his worldview and a rationale for his murders as a grand artistic gesture.In the first incident, Jack encounters a woman on a rural road who needs to fix her broken jack to repair a flat tire. He takes her to the local blacksmith who repairs it, but when they return and attempt to lift the car, the jack breaks again. The woman requests that Jack return her to the blacksmith. Offended by her manner, Jack bludgeons her with the tire jack. He stores her body in an industrial freezer inside a factory building, which he previously purchased from a pizzeria.In the second incident, Jack cons his way into the home of a widow, Claire, and strangles her to death before stabbing her in the chest. At night, Jack drags Claire's body out of her house and puts it in the back of his car. His obsessive-compulsive disorder propels him to meticulously clean every surface of the house, nearly resulting in him being caught when a suspicious police officer stops in the area. Jack hides Claire's body in the bushes before the officer stops by Claire's home. Jack manages to outwit the guileless officer by pretending to be an acquaintance of Claire. Jack soon leaves, he grabs rope from the plastic that the body was wrapped up in and ties it to the van. Jack drives off towing Claire's body behind the van creating a blood trail from the head dragging on the pavement. He arrives at the warehouse as it starts raining, washing away the blood trail and putting Claire's corpse in the freezer. After this incident, Jack declares himself ""Mr. Sophistication,"" and begins signing anonymous letters to the media with this moniker. He also develops a fetish for posing and photographing his victims' corpses.In the third incident, Jack brings his girlfriend and her two sons, Grumpy and George, on a hunting trip in a forest clearing. During the excursion, he kills both sons with a rifle from a hunting tower before forcing the woman to have a picnic with their corpses. He then hunts and ultimately kills her. As Jack recounts this incident-which he analogizes to hunting animals-Verge comments with particular disgust for Jack's murdering of children.In the fourth incident, Jack is carrying on a dysfunctional relationship with Jacqueline (Riley Keough), whom he demeaningly refers to as ""Simple"" as he believes her to be stupid. When he drunkenly confesses to Jacqueline that he has killed 60 people, she does not believe him. After he marks red circles around her breasts with a marker, she becomes frightened and approaches a policeman, but he dismisses her and Jack as drunks. After being locked without escape in her apartment, Jack binds and gags her before cutting off her breasts with a knife. He pins one of the breasts to the policeman's car and fashions the other into a wallet.In the fifth incident, Jack has detained five men in his freezer and bound them with their heads positioned along a post, intending to kill all of them with a single bullet. Upon realizing his ammunition has been mislabeled, he leaves and angrily chastises the gun shop owner before visiting a friend, SP, who phones a police officer who has accused Jack of a recent robbery. Jack stabs SP through the throat, waits for the police, then kills the summoned officer. Jack steals the officer's car and returns to his freezer with the appropriate bullet. Needing more space to gain focus through the scope, Jack unseals a closed door inside the freezer, revealing a second chamber. Inside, he meets Verge, who reveals he has been observing Jack throughout his life and reminds him that he has never built the literal home he intended to build. Jack had made several attempts to build the perfect house between his murders. In the freezer, Jack arranges the frozen corpses he has collected over the years into the shape of a house. As police break into the freezer, drawn by the car siren Jack has left on outside, Jack enters his makeshift house, and follows Verge into a hole in the floor, entering Hell.After passing a window overlooking the Elysian Fields, the two eventually reach a pit leading to the ninth circle and centre of Hell. A broken bridge spans the pit. Jack notices a stairway on the other side of the bridge, which Verge says leads to the way out of Hell. Jack attempts to scale a rock wall to access the staircase, against Verge's advice, and falls into the abyss below."

Sam recognizes Sarah's hat at the scene, and a small dog similar to Sarah's found dead.Sam contacts the author of Under the Silver Lake, an underground comic about neighborhood urban legends. He tells Sam that Sarah's disappearance, the Dog Killer, the Owl's Kiss - a naked woman in an owl mask who seduces and kills people in their sleep - and messages in pop culture are part of the same conspiracy and has installed security cameras throughout his house.

Vita is drawn to the progressive and sexually liberated group of artists, politicians and authors, intrigued particularly by the mystery and apparent aloofness of Virginia.Having a long-held and deep contempt for the upper classes, Leonard Woolf (Peter Ferdinando) is suspicious of this socialite's sudden appearance in their lives but Virginia persuades him that their publishing house, Hogarth Press, should publish Vita's next book. Something more than a working relationship blooms between the two women; although each writer holds the other in high regard and they are celebrated in their own right, they crave a particular acceptance from each other. Their mutual admiration, though fast becoming charged with a tension and a passion which excites them both, is peppered with doubts. Their backgrounds and sensibilities are so far apart on the social spectrum that their relationship and even friendship seems doomed. A brief but significant visit to Vita's ancestral home marks their inescapable differences in Virginia's mind and it reignites her fear that she cannot love others in the same way as they do her.Vita and Harold's marriage of convenience threatens to crumble as she becomes frustrated and suffocated by the role of submissive and dutiful wife, distracted by the exciting opportunities that being Virginia's lover offers. There is always a sense that Vita is desperate to lift the curtain on the 'real' Virginia, to reveal the truth behind the myth and Virginia relishes the challenge, even if she is not always entirely comfortable with it. Their relationship oscillates, they circle around each other and there are constant contradictions between what is said and what is meant. It is when they are separated by Harold's diplomatic responsibilities that the truth pours out. Their letters are infused with a fierce love and longing, a desperation to explore and analyse the heart and the mind - this is where they are most comfortable, each a muse for the other.Vita & Virginia offers a glimpse into the complex nature of relationships and marriages, questioning what it is to be female and feminine and details the fraught hypocrisies of living in the 1920s. Punctuating the film is Virginia's well publicised mania, depicted through visual, imaginative metaphors, a reminder of her vulnerability that Vita is eager to dispel. Throughout the story, characters struggle with the unwritten rules of jealousy, revolution, power and the myriad forms that love takes. It is from one such struggle, after Virginia sees Vita with another woman, that Orlando: A Biography is born, canonising Vita forever as Virginia's muse."

She confronts Jennifer's father, but he grabs the gun from her and talks her out of her suspicions. She returns to the observatory, and considers suicide, but instead checks out an old, boarded up house.In the house, she relives the murder of her mother. She was hiding in a closet when the .38 Caliber Killer shot her. Young Mike came out of the closet and rubbed the moisturizing cream on her dead mother's hands, asking her to wake up.

The film itself is an anthology of six tales taken from the book with six, consequent, colour plate illustrations for each story. We slowly open the book and observe the first colour plate and first story...Story 1: THE BALLAD OF BUSTER SCRUGGS
Colour Illustration: Two cowboys rising from a gambling table, with one pointing a gun at the other and the caption below reading: ""'You seen 'em, you play 'em,' sneered the surly man"".We begin the story in Colorado, in Monument Valley as we observe the protagonist of this story: Buster Scruggs (Tim Blake Nelson). He dresses like Glen Campbell's 'Rhinestone Cowboy', rides a white stallion named 'Dan', plays a guitar, and merrily sings the country tune: 'Cool, Clear Water'. He brings his horse to a stop in a low canyon, and ""breaks the fourth wall"" as he tells the viewers who he is and how he doesn't really consider his ""outlaw"" status to be earned as he removes a 'WANTED' poster from one of his saddlebags. He then resolves to ride over to a nearby cantina for a well-deserved drink and potential game of cards.He finally arrives at the run-down cantina and asks the owner for a drink of whiskey. The unhelpful barkeeper tells Buster that whiskey is prohibited; the county is under prohibition laws. Buster points out the five thugs (and only customers) sitting at a nearby table drinking liquor and the barman explains that they are ""outlaws"". Buster explains that though he may have the appearance of a ""tinhorn"", he is in fact an outlaw himself. However, one of the thugs rises and provokes Buster into a duel. There and then, Buster quickly draws a fires on the thug, blowing a hole in his head! When the man's friends attempt to fire on Buster, Scruggs quickly guns the rest of them down as well before shooting the bartender who was in the act of reaching for a shotgun above the bar. Buster then holsters his pistol, opens the door of the cantina for a wounded thug and sets off on Dan, for the nearby town of ""Frenchman's Gulch"".Eventually, Buster arrives at the town and goes over to the local saloon. He is accosted at the door by an elderly man who requests that he turns in all of his firearms, courtesy of ""House Policy"". Buster does so reluctantly, realizing what a disadvantage he is now in. He spots a nearby poker table and goes over, hoping to join in on the game as one of the players quickly exits. He takes his seat with the three other players but it's now that he happens to look at his hand: ""Dead Man's Hand"". He expresses to the table, his wishes to not play the hand, but is threatened by a large, brutish man at the end of the table by the name of Joe (Clancy Brown), who growls over: ""You seen 'em, you play 'em!"" When Buster refuses, Joe rises from the table and reveals a hidden pistol, holstered at his hip. He removes it and aims it at Buster, who promptly introduces himself before reminding the man of the ""House Policy"". Joe is about to open fire when Buster quickly kicks down on the wooden boards of the poker table, catapulting the table up and into Joe's hand, which is knocked backwards into Joe's face as the pistol goes off, firing in his face! Buster does this twice more, before Joe falls to the floor, dead! Buster promptly bursts into song over the deceased thug, and is soon joined by the contents of the cantina and piano player as they all sing ""Surly Joe The Gambler"".However, without Buster's notice, ""Surly Joe's"" brother Ike (Danny McCarthy) has made his way into the saloon and sits, bitterly sobbing over his dead brother's body. Once the singing stops, Ike promptly gets up and challenges the reluctant Buster to a duel outside in revenge over his brother.Outside, Buster readies himself and loads his pistol before meeting Ike in the street. He asks Ike if he needs a ""count"" before the shoot. Ike answers ""Na'Sir"", but this is a fatal error as Buster uses this to quickly fire upon Ike, blowing his index finger off! He then blasts off Ike's remaining fingers and thumb so that he's unable to fire back with his gun hand. However, this fails to stop Ike, who continues to struggle for his gun with his left hand. Buster realizes that he'll have to kill him but is determined to do it in style: he turns away from the struggling Ike and uses a small mirror to aim his pistol back over his shoulder! It's a near-impossible shot, but Buster makes it effortlessly, gunning down the agonized Ike!He goes over to Ike's body and is about to sing when the sound of a harmonica, heralds the arrival of a young gunslinger (Willy Watson), dressed in black and riding a black stallion. He greets Buster respectfully, acknowledging his reputation as a ""singing"" gunman. He promptly challenges Buster to a duel; Buster is known as ""the one to beat"". Reluctantly, Buster consents to the duel and loads his pistol, candidly joking about how he should go into the ""undertaking business"". It's now that the young man asks Buster if he needs a count. Buster however, makes the same, fatal mistake as Ike, coolly answering: ""Na'Sir"". This is all the other man needs, who puts a bullet straight through Buster's forehead! Buster is puzzled, but upon seeing the hole in his forehead (with the mirror), he sheepishly remarks: ""Well, that a'int good"", and falls down, dead! Via a heavenly voice-over, the ghost of Buster Scruggs summarizes: ""I shoulda seen this comin'; can't be top dog forever!""The young man strolls over to Buster's body and bursts into song himself, singing a duet with Buster's winged, lyre-playing ghost: ""When A Cowboy Trades His Spurs For Wings"". Slowly, we see the young man ride away and watch, as Buster's ghost ascends into heaven and the song ends...This first story ends and we turn to the next one in the book.Story 2: NEAR ALGODONES
Colour Illustration: An elderly man covered in pots and pans and clutching a shotgun, with the caption reading: ""'Pan shot!' cried the old man"".This next story begins at an isolated savings bank in the middle of a desolate prairie. A young cowboy (James Franco), rides up to the establishment and goes on inside. He engages the jabbering bank teller (Stephen Root) in meaningless conversation but then removes a pistol from his side and aims it at the teller, demanding money! The teller sheepishly consents and stoops to remove the bills before firing off three, concealed shotguns at the footing of the cowboy. The young man manages to avoid each burst of fire but when he climbs over the till, he finds that the teller has apparently fled the bank. He removes the bills, places them in a large satchel and exits the bank. However, as he heads for his horse, his foot is grazed with buck shot, forcing him to drop the money and take cover behind a nearby well. He tries to get his horse to come to him, but as he looks over the well, he sees the crazed teller exit the side of the bank, wearing a set of pots and pans for armour and clutching his shotgun. The teller sees him and charges, the cowboy fires at him, but every time he fires, the bullet is deflected by the teller's ""armour"", who jeeringly cries at the young man: ""Pan shot!"" The cowboy continues to fire until he runs out of bullets, as the teller finally reaches him and knocks him unconscious with the butt of his heavy shotgun! The film cuts to black...When the cowboy wakes, we seem him mounted on top of a horse with a noose around his neck and his hands bound. He is facing a lynching posse, led by a lawman dressed in black (Ralph Ineson). The lawman addresses him curtly, saying that he is sentenced to hang for the crime of bank robbery and asks if he is willing to give up his horse to the posse once he is dead. The cowboy refuses, but before his ""sentence"" can be carried out, the posse is ambushed by a small war party of Commanche Indians who promptly massacre all the members of the lynching group, including the lawman. Through the bloody chaos, the cowboy tries to keep his horse steady, so that he won't fall off and hang himself. Eventually, the brutal warriors depart after claiming their victory (and consequent scalps) and the cowboy is left alone. The horse is visibly unnerved and continues to trot further forwards, forcing the cowboy, ever closer to falling off and hanging!He sits like this on his horse for a while, until he is suddenly discovered by a scruffy young drover (Jesse Luken), who's been leading a herd of cattle across the plains. The drover resolves to shoot the cowboy free and takes aim at the rope of the noose. He fires, but misses, and the horse bolts, temporarily hanging the cowboy! The drover fires again and again until finally, he shoots through the rope and sends the cowboy crashing to the floor! A little while later, the cowboy is riding side-by-side with the drover as they drive the cattle on wards, through the desert of Algodones, Mexico. The drover proposes for them to become partners when suddenly, he spots riders on the horizon! He sharply abandons both the cowboy and the herd, riding off in the opposite direction. The cowboy is puzzled, not understanding who's who or what's what...The next time we see the cowboy, he is chained and being herded through a small town by a rough bailiff (Austin Rising). He is brought up to the town's grumpy old fart of a judge (Michael Cullen), and swiftly sentenced to hang, despite the flimsy evidence and his pleads of innocence. The cowboy is taken up to a public gallows, where his noosed along with several other, blubbering criminals. The cowboy looks down off the gallows, and spots a pretty young woman in the audience. He smiles, and remarks: ""There's a pretty girl"", before a hood his placed over his head, and the lever is pulled, to the thunderous applause of the crowd...The second story ends, and now begins the third story of the book.Story 3: MEAL TICKET
Colour Illustration: A young thespian with a powdered face, looking heavenwards with the caption reading: ""'The quality of mercy is not strained, It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven'"".Our next story begins in the forested mountains of Colorado, as we follow an aged, Irish Impresario (Liam Neeson). He drives a small wagon that is painted with various illustrations, depicting great works of literature and theatre. The Impresario pulls into a small mining town where he dishes out pamphlets detailing an apparent show he intends to put on, featuring: ""The Artistry Of Edwin Horatio Harrison""/""The Wingless Thrush"". He now goes round to his wagon, which he converts into a small stage with lighting, a painted background and a chair in the center. Slowly, people begin to turn up for the performance and at 08:30 pm, the Impresario reveals the main event of his show: an arm-less, legless thespian who sits upon the chair in the center of the stage and is to be known as Horatio Edwin Harrison (Harry Melling). The audience is visibly shocked but enchanted, as this deformed actor begins to recite infamous works and speeches from literature, Shakespeare and real life including: ""Ozymandias""; the story of Cain and Abel; Sonnet 29 and the Gettysburg Address. All the while, the Impersario goes through the audience collecting donations and tips.This is the life of Horatio and the Impresario: travelling from town to town, to deliver recital after recital, as the Impresario cares for, feeds and cleans the disadvantaged thespian. As they travel further North, snow begins to set in. The profits also begin to decrease as the audiences rapidly loose interest...One night, after drunkenly singing the Irish folk tune 'Weela Walla Wallya', the Impresario takes Horatio down into the nearby town to visit the local brothel. While the Impresario get's his money's worth, Horatio is left, turned to face a wall. Afterwards, the portly prostitute (Jiji Hise), asks the Impresario if his friend wants any ""loving"", but the Impresario answers ""no"", saying that he was once in love...The pair give another performance that yields hardly any turnover as their crowd begin to leave. The Impresario is busy folding the stage up when suddenly, his attention is caught by what exactly the audience has turned to instead. He goes over to the assembled crowd and sees what they're all looking at: on a lighted stage (not unlike Horatio's), a chicken performs basic maths: addition and subtraction! People pose the chicken's owner various sums and the chicken is tasked with pecking at the right answers on painted slabs. The Impresario is amused at this spectacle, but more interested in the amount of people and the amounts of their consequent tips! Gathering all the money that he's amassed over his and Horatio's performances, the Impresario buys the chicken of its owner. He feeds it and cares for it, just as he's cared for Horatio, but the young thespian now realizes that he has sadly been replaced and is now effectively, expendable!Through snow-covered pastures, the Impresario drives the carriage. Inside Horatio sits next to the caged chicken, eyeing it nervously as it watches him. The Impresario finally stops the carriage at a bridge overlooking a small river. He gets out of the carriage and goes over to the side of the bridge. Horatio nervously watches him as he picks up a large stone and throws it down into the river below. A sizable splash is heard before the Impresario turns back to the carriage and Horatio. He approaches with a sly grin on his face but Horatio knows only too well, what is coming...A little while later, we see the carriage rattling on wards towards the snow-topped mountains. However, as we look inside, we sadly see: that the caged chicken, is the Impresario's only passenger...This third story comes to an end, and we now look at the fourth story of the book.Story 4: ALL GOLD CANYON
Colour Illustration: An old man hangs of the side of a tall pine tree, looking out at the horizon, and sweeping hills of the mountain valley that lie before him with the caption: ""And in all that mighty sweep of earth he saw no sign of man nor the handiwork of man"".Our fourth story begins in a truly glorious and totally untouched mountain valley, complete with thick patches of forest and shrub and a large stream flowing down the center of the valley. All is peaceful, all is natural, until we begin to hear the out-of-tune, croaky voice of an old man, sounding out from the patch of forest that rests at the start of the valley. The singing (of an old Irish tune: 'Mother Machree') belongs to an elderly prospector (Tom Waits), who leads a pack mule across the valley floor and over the stream to a hill, where he tethers the mule and takes a drink from the river. Up and down the stream, he vigorously begins to pan for gold. At one of the panning points, he sees that there are more gold specks there than at any of the others. So, he resolves to dig several holes at this point, proclaiming that he will find the gold seems buried there, as he refers to this apparent ""Motherlode"" as: ""Mr. Pocket"". He digs three large holes at this point on the hill, but only comes up with a few tiny nuggets of gold; not ""Mr. Pocket""! He resolves to sleep on it, and find ""Mr. Pocket"" in the morning. He enjoys a small supper before going to sleep under the stars, looking forward to the next day and his continued search for ""Mr. Pocket"".In the morning, while catching fish for his breakfast, the prospector spots a horned owl up in a tree with five, large eggs. He slowly clambers up the tree till he reaches the top and the owl's nest. He takes all five eggs and puts them in his satchel however, he happens to see the owl on another tree, looking down at him. The prospector feels sorry for the terrified owl mother, and kindly decides to replace four of the five eggs he took. He clambers back down the tree, and cooks the egg and fish for his breakfast. He then returns to his dig site and continues digging in the hole that has yielded the largest gold chunks. As he continues to dig, the gold nuggets get larger and larger until finally, the prospector reaches the fat gold seam that he's been looking for: ""Mr. Pocket""! The old man is happy beyond words and prepares to dig up the gold when suddenly, a shadow falls over him: a young man (Sam Dillon) aiming a pistol, stands over the prospector. The grizzled old prospector knows that he's been tracked by a scavenger but before he can react, the young coward shoots him in the back! He falls down into the hole as his wound begins to leak blood across the back of his shirt...The young man sits back on the edge of the hole, making sure the prospector's dead and rolling himself a cigarette. He takes a drag and puts it out before getting down into the hole and preparing to mine the seams. However, the prospector is not dead! He quickly turns over and begins a desperate struggle with the young man. He manages to wrestle the coward's gun away from him, and blasts him three time in the face! The young man now lies in the hole dead! The prospector is beside himself with fury but goes straight to the river, where he rinses his wound and checks its severity: luckily, it's just a flesh wound. He promptly returns to the hole and finally, mines ""Mr. Pocket"". He takes the nuggets and stores them in his satchel before burying the young scavenger and filling-in his other digging holes. He goes back to his mule and sets off once again, singing 'Mother Machree', though neither him nor the landscape are quite the same as they were at the beginning of the story...As this fourth story comes to an end, we now look at the penultimate story of the book.Story 5: THE GAL WHO GOT RATTLED
Colour Illustration: A tall cowboy walks over a hill and towards a wagon train with a rifle over his shoulder and a barking dog at his heels. Another cowboy on a horse is riding up towards him, and the caption reads: ""Mr. Arthur had no idea what he would say to Billy Knap"".This penultimate story begins in the dining room of a boarding house. A young woman named Alice Longabaugh (Zoe Kazan), her brother Gilbert (Jefferson Mays), Gilbert's dog (a terrier named President Pierce) and several others enjoy dinner together as Gilbert discusses with the table, his and his sister's traveling plans: they are both traveling as part of a wagon train to Oregon where Gilbert has arranged for Alice to marry a business partner of his.Several days later, we observe the wagon train as it makes its way across the rough frontier towards Oregon. Gilbert's dog is an almost constant nuisance throughout the journey, but Gilbert is blissfully ignorant of President Pierce's near-constant barking. However, tragedy soon strikes as Gilbert abruptly passes away from what appears to be cholera. Alice, along with the help of two of the guides: Mr. Arthur (Grainger Hines) and Billy Knap (Bill Heck), buries her brother as the train continues towards its destination. Alice too decides to continue the trip rather than return East. However Matt (Ethan Dubin), the drover of Alice's wagon, claims that the deceased Gilbert promised him $400, half of which he expects when they reach the halfway point at Fort Laramie, otherwise he'll return home. Fearing Gilbert's money was buried with him, Alice conveys her dire situation to Billy Knap, who offers his support in contemplating how to proceed. He also does Alice the favor of attempting to shoot President Pierce. However, he bungles the job and the dog runs off onto the plains.Through the course of their conversations, Billy grows fond of Alice, and proposes to solve her dilemmas by marrying her in Fort Laramie, assuming Gilbert's debt to Matt, and retiring from leading wagon trains to build a home and family with her upon 640 acres in Oregon which he can claim according to the 'Homestead Act'. Alice is surprised by Billy's proposal, but she has grown fond of him, so she accepts. Billy then informs Mr. Arthur that this will be their last ride together.The following morning, Mr. Arthur notices Alice missing, and rides over the hills to find her reunited with President Pierce and laughing as the dog barks at the antics of some prairie dogs. However, to his horror, Mr. Arthur spots an advancing Sioux war sentinel. He attempts to make peace signs but his signs are not reciprocated. He realizes that he and Alice will have to make a stand since the ground is riddled with prairie dog holes and would surely trip up the horse. However, he also states to Alice that such holes are just as bad for the Indian riders, as they are for him and her. He then makes a fort using his saddle, brings out his Winchester rifle and arms Alice with a pistol, so that if he's killed, she can shoot herself before she's captured by the Sioux warriors. Mr. Arthur then readies himself as the Indians begin to charge them. He opens fire as soon as they get in range, de-horsing several. However, a couple of riders are taken out as their horses fall on the prairie dog holes. As the Indians amass for a second attack, Mr. Arthur tells Alice that if he can take out their Chief, they may abandon their attack. He cocks his rifle and prepares for this final charge, summarizing: ""This'll tell the tale!"" He fires again, aiming for the Chief, however, the Chief's horse is suddenly thrown by a prairie hole and Chief goes sprawling on the ground. As expected, the Indians retreat after their Chief's downfall however, one Indian has survived the charges and clubs Mr. Arthur on the side of the head. He approaches Mr. Arthur and prepares to scalp him when Mr. Arthur suddenly pulls out a hidden pistol and blasts the Indian in the face. He then rises and returns to Alice. However, Alice has tragically done just as Mr. Arthur commanded and has shot herself in the head; to Alice, it looked like Mr. Arthur had died when the Indian had clubbed him! Mr. Arthur is heartbroken at such a pointless waste of life, and he heads off for the wagon train, casually blasting a wounded Indian as he walks! He returns to the train and is promptly greeted by a horsed Billy Knap, and gravely prepares to break the bad news as he's followed by a barking President Pierce...After this fifth story, we now look at the sixth and final story of 'THE BALLAD OF BUSTER SCRUGGS'.Story 6: THE MORTAL REMAINS
Colour Illustration: A moonlit stagecoach charges on wards through dark forest as we look up at the cloaked and masked driver, and the final caption that reads: ""Wether or not he heard, the coachman did not slow"".This final story begins at sunset, as five people, an Englishman named Thigpen (Jonjo O'Neill), an Irishman named Clarence (Brendan Gleeson), a Frenchman named René (Saul Rubinek), an elderly lady named Mrs. Betjeman (Tyne Daly) and a grizzled fur trapper (Chelcie Ross) ride to Fort Morgan, Colorado in a stagecoach. Thigpen says that he and Clarence often travel this route ""ferrying cargo"", alluding to a corpse on the roof, but he does not specify the nature of their business.The Trapper rambles about his past relationship with a Native woman in which neither knew the other's language, but communicating through understanding each other's emotions led him to conclude that people are all alike in their basic needs, just like the animals he traps. Mrs. Betjeman, a devout Christian, indignantly rebuts that there are two kinds of people, upright and sinning, and explains that she knows this because her husband, whom she's traveling to meet after having been apart for three years, is a retired Chautauqua lecturer on ""moral and spiritual hygiene."" René challenges her dichotomy and the trapper's oversimplification with reflections on the unique and subjective nature of human experiences. As an example, René questions whether Mr. Betjeman conceives of love the same way Mrs. Betjeman does, conjecturing that if he doesn't, perhaps he has not remained faithful to her during their separation.Mrs. Betjamen becomes apoplectic, and René calls out the window for the coachman to stop, but the driver doesn't halt. Thigpen explains that it is the driver's policy not to stop for any reason. Clarence sings the bittersweet folk song ""The Unfortunate Lad"", which calms Mrs. Betjamen. He and Thigpen then reveal themselves to be ""reapers"" or bounty hunters. Thigpen tells the group that their usual method is for him to distract a target with stories (like ""The Midnight Caller"") while Clarence ""thumps"" them. Thigpen remarks that he enjoys watching their prey die, especially the expression in their eyes as they ""negotiate the passage"" and ""try to make sense of it.""The other three are visibly unsettled by this as they arrive at the foreboding hotel in Fort Morgan where they will all be staying. They remain in the stagecoach while Thigpen and Clarence carry the corpse into the hotel, then slowly dismount and warily make their own way inside...Our leather bound book finally closes, as we finish these six tales of both good and evil on the American Frontier..."
Bird Box,2018,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2737304/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Five years after an ominous unseen presence drives most of society to suicide, a mother and her two children make a desperate bid to reach safety. In the wake of an unknown global terror, a mother must find the strength to flee with her children down a treacherous river in search of safety. Due to unseen deadly forces, the perilous journey must be made blindly. Directed by Emmy winner Susanne Bier, Bird Box is a thriller starring Academy Award winner Sandra Bullock, John Malkovich, Sarah Paulson, and Trevante Rhodes.—Netflix Amid a nightmarish new reality where an unseen malevolent force wipes out the global population, single mother-of-two Malorie embarks on a life-threatening quest to find the last protected haven on Earth. However, in this dangerous quest, eyesight is the real enemy. And as the vulnerable blindfolded protector summons up the courage to follow faint shreds of hope, darkness may be the only thing that stands between humans and the invisible adversary. But the rules of survival have changed. Will Malorie and her kids live to see another day?—Nick Riganas The film starts with a woman named Malorie Hayes (Sandra Bullock) telling two kids, known only as Boy (Julian Edwards) and Girl (Vivien Lyra Blair), that they are going to take a dangerous trip across the water, and she stresses how urgent it is that they keep their blindfolds on as they head outside. Malorie grabs a box with her pet birds inside and guides the kids outside by following a string trail before finding the boat and hopping in on the river.Five years earlier.Malorie is an artist who is pregnant. She is visited by her sister Jessica (Sarah Paulson), and the two watch a news report on unexplained mass suicides that started in Siberia and is now spreading across Europe. Jess notices Malorie's painting, which she says symbolizes a lack of connection, but Jess tells her that it won't be like that with the baby. She then offers to escort Malorie to the doctor.Malorie visits Dr. Lapham (Parminder Nagra) and makes jokes with Jess about drinking while pregnant. Lapham doesn't find the comments too humorous and offers Malorie an alternative to let someone adopt the baby if she feels she isn't ready to raise it. On their way out of the office, Malorie and Jess notice a woman they passed earlier now acting erratic and banging her head against the glass window. They realize that whatever was affecting people in Europe and Siberia has now arrived in America. They run outside just as the chaos is happening, with people crashing their cars in the street. Jess drives Malorie away, but not long after, Jess's eyes turn a weird color as she starts to appear frightened by something only she can see. She drives frantically, with Malorie trying to keep her on the road, but Jess flips the car and crashes. They survive, but Jess is still under a trance, and Malorie can only watch as her sister steps in front of a truck.Malorie runs along with everyone else. She is knocked over and falls in front of a house. A woman named Lydia (Rebecca Pidgeon) steps out of her house to go help Malorie, even as her husband Douglas (John Malkovich) objects to it. Before Lydia can help Malorie up, she appears to go into a trance and seems to be talking to her mother. Lydia walks into a burning car that soon explodes. A man named Tom (Trevante Rhodes) helps Malorie up and runs into the house. They are followed by a cop named Lucy (Rosa Salazar). Also in the house are Greg (BD Wong), the homeowner, Charlie (Lil Rel Howery), Felix (Machine Gun Kelly), Cheryl (Jackie Weaver), and a couple named Jason (Taylor Handley) and Samantha (Amy Gumenick). The latter two flee the house when they hear their son over the phone sounding like he's in danger.The other people all tell each other what they have seen in those who have been afflicted by this mysterious force. Charlie suspects that the entity is caused by demons that take the form of one's deepest sadness or greatest loss. They all realize that the entity is invisible and that looking at it will cause one to commit suicide. Malorie steps away from the group, and Tom goes to comfort her as she tells him what happened to Jess. The group then boards up the doors and place newspapers on the windows to prevent anyone from looking outside.In the present day, after six hours on the river, Malorie and the children continue to go down the river as it is now pitch black. Malorie makes attempts to contact people over the radio, and she starts to hear the entity whispering her name.Back in the past, a survivor named Olympia (Danielle Macdonald) pleads to be let in the house. Douglas tries to prevent this, but Malorie grabs a rifle just in case. The others carefully allow Olympia into the house, and they see that she is also pregnant. Greg then offers to observe whatever is outside by checking out the transmitters in the house. He sits in front of the computers waiting to see something on the monitors, and then it looks as though he does. And then the others hear a thumping coming from the room. They rush upstairs in time to see Greg tip himself over and smash his head against an edge, killing him. The others then destroy the computer monitor.Later that night, Olympia tries to talk with Malorie over their potential baby names, but Malorie just wants to be left alone. She walks around and thinks she hears a thumping noise in the house, but she finds it's just Lucy and Felix hooking up.Fourteen hours on the river.Malorie hears the voice of a man (Happy Anderson) calling out and saying it's safe to take the blindfolds off, but Malorie orders the kids not to do so. He claims he has food and that he has seen the entity, saying there's no reason to be scared of it. Malorie takes out her gun and fires blindly, just before the man attacks her and tries to take her blindfold off. Malorie fights the man and kills him by hacking at him with a machete.Back in the past, the group has begun to run out of food, and they know help isn't coming. Malorie, Tom, Douglas, Lucy, and Charlie get together to go to the supermarket where Charlie used to work since he locked the place up as things went sideways. They paint over the windows and use the GPS to guide them. On the road, they feel that they are driving over dead bodies and try to ignore it. The GPS then starts going off over a proximity alert, meaning the entity is surrounding them. Tom manages to drive them out of harm's way. They get to the market and grab as much food as they can. Malorie sees some birds that she decides to take with her as pets. Suddenly, they hear the voice of Charlie's co-worker Fish Fingers (Matt Leonard) locked in a freezer and begging to be let out. He then starts going on about how the entity is beautiful and must be seen. Fish Fingers starts to break out while Lucy, Tom, and Douglas try to hold him back. Charlie then sees the entity and realizes he is doomed. He charges toward Fish Fingers and has them both shut in the freezer where Charlie dies, letting the others return home. Fish Fingers' voice is still heard begging to be let out.That night, Malorie briefly bonds with Douglas over their personal problems. The others then hear what sounds like the car being driven away. They go into the garage and find that it's gone, and so are Lucy and Felix.24 hours on the riverMalorie stops rowing to take a break. When she resumes, she bumps the boat into a sunken truck, and Boy falls out of the boat, but Malorie pulls him out and tries to warm him, but the food and blankets have fallen into the river, so she does her best to warm Boy up. She leaves the kids in the boat as she heads into the woods to try and gather food. Malorie enters a building where she hears a noise and sees things moving on their own, being pulled by the entity. She manages to make her way out of the building, but the entity continues to whisper her name. Malorie fires her gun at the unseen entity, which Girl hears and so she leaves the boat to help Malorie, but she finds Girl and grabs her, scolding her for leaving the boat as they return to it.In the past, Tom tells Malorie about how he was stationed in Iraq, and he and his comrades would follow a man as he was escorting his kids to school in the middle of all the chaos. The two of them also start to develop feelings for each other.Olympia lets a desperate man named Gary (Tom Hollander) into the house. The others aggressively search and interrogate Gary. He tells the others that some escaped mental patients came after him and his friend, forcing the two of them to look at the creatures. Gary's friend fought one of them, allowing him to get away and run to the house. He says there are also people outside not wearing blindfolds, willingly trying to see the creatures and wanting others to see them. Douglas doesn't trust Gary and tries to force him out of the house at gunpoint, but Cheryl knocks him out and lets Gary stay, and they lock Douglas in the garage. Olympia tearfully apologizes for letting Gary in and says she feels like a burden, but Malorie tells her she isn't. Olympia then asks Malorie to take care of her baby if something happens to her, and Malorie agrees. She then gives Olympia a Hello Kitty toy to give the baby.38 hours on the riverWe see Girl holding the Hello Kitty toy, indicating she is Olympia's daughter. Malorie gets herself and the kids under a blanket to warn them that they are approaching the rapids, and that it will be the most dangerous part of the journey. She tells them that somebody is going to have to have their eyes open to navigate, and both kids volunteer, but Malorie decides it's not worth sacrificing either of them, so she says nobody will look, and they will just brave the rapids with blindfolds.PastBoth Malorie and Olympia begin to go into labor. While Tom and Cheryl help the women, Gary takes out a bunch of drawings of the creatures, as he is one of the crazy people who has seen them and wants others to see them. He takes Malorie's birds and puts them in the fridge (since they appear to sense and alert others to danger) before tearing the papers off the windows, which Douglas observes. Gary opens the garage door to try and get rid of Douglas. Meanwhile, Olympia gives birth to a girl while Malorie gives birth to a boy. Gary enters the room and pulls the blinds up in front of Olympia. She hands Malorie her baby right before she jumps out the window. Gary then forces Cheryl to open her eyes to the outside, causing her to kill herself with scissors. Douglas comes in with the rifle, but cannot shoot with his eyes open and is afraid to hit Malorie and the babies. He manages to shoot Gary in the arm, but he kills Douglas by stabbing him with the scissors. Tom then sees the rifle and tries to grab it, as does Gary. Two gunshots are heard, but Tom is seen alive going to be with Malorie and the babies.It is now five years later, just before the start of the film. Malorie and Tom have been living together, raising the two kids, but Tom calls Malorie out for not connecting with them or even giving them names. They hear something outside, and it's some people driving their cars out with no blindfolds or covers on the windows. Malorie starts setting up her system outside as a warning for the kids.At night, the two receive a radio transmission from a man named Rick, who says he is at a safe compound with plenty of supplies and food. He instructs them on how to make it to the compound down the river, telling them how dangerous it is to go down there with children, and how they will need to see in order to get through. Rick tells them to follow the sound of birds to find the place.Tom wants to go to the compound, but Malorie thinks it could be a trap. Outside, the survivors from earlier make it to the house. Tom goes to confront them while Malorie and the kids get out safely. The survivors, led by ""Whistling Marauder"" (David Dastmalchian), order Tom to take off his blindfold. When they spot Malorie and the kids, Tom fires and kills three of the marauders before he takes one shot himself. Tom takes off his blindfold and kills two more before going after the leader, who is stalking Malorie and the kids. The entity starts to affect Tom, but he fights it long enough to kill the leader before turning the gun on himself, letting Malorie know Tom is gone. Malorie then gets the kids together to head onto the river.It has now been 42 hours on the river, and they are fast approaching the rapids. They reach the bumpy waters, which Malorie tries to get through, but the boat flips over and everyone falls out. Malorie calls out to the kids and finds Boy in the water, while Girl has made it to the land, and Malorie finds her because Girl has a bell that she keeps ringing. The three then walk through the woods where the entity whispers to them and uses all its power to try and get them to see, but Malorie's will is stronger, and she gets the kids to listen to her and not look. She follows the sounds of the birds as they make it to the compound, but the entity surrounds them as she tries to make it inside until someone opens the door and lets them in.Malorie's eyes are checked, and she and the kids are cleared for entry. They meet Rick (Pruitt Taylor Vince), and Malorie discovers that the compound is a school for the blind, and the people in there are protected from the entities. Malorie and the kids then find Dr. Lapham, who happily greets them. She asks the kids their names, and Malorie finally names them - Girl is named Olympia after her mother, and Boy is named after Tom. Malorie proudly says they are her children and she is their mother. Malorie then opens her bird box and frees the birds to be with the others in the sanctuary."

The duo begins traveling to the site on foot and comes across an abandoned dig site. Damon and Cee extract a fleshy pod from the earth and dissect it to reveal a valuable gem. Cee implores her father to take the gem and return to the lander, but Damon insists they continue to the original landing site.The pair set out again, and Damon is approached by two rival prospectors: Ezra and his silent companion. Ezra and his partner plan to rob Damon and hold him at gunpoint, but Damon suggests in a counter-offer that they join forces. Damon explains that he has been contacted to assist a group of mercenaries who stumbled upon the legendary 'queen's lair', a dig site of extraordinary value. Damon suggests that rather than digging for the mercenaries, Ezra, his companion, and Damon can work together and take the entire dig for themselves.Ezra agrees, but Cee, who has been hiding throughout this encounter, ambushes the two hostile prospectors with a rifle - allowing Damon to wrest a weapon from Ezra before taking the latter and his partner hostage. Damon attempts to rob Ezra, but the partner attacks him and the pair shoot each other. Ezra's partner is killed and Damon is mortally wounded before being executed by Ezra himself.Cee flees back to her damaged lander, which fails to start, and is found by Ezra several hours later. When Ezra attempts to enter, Cee wounds him in the arm with her rifle and takes him prisoner. Ezra suggests that they follow Damon's original plan and aid the mercenaries in exchange for passage on the mercenaries' ship. Cee reluctantly agrees, and the pair sets out for the queen's lair. Ezra's wound has become infected by the poisonous spores in the atmosphere, and so the pair approaches a group of human villagers with the intent to trade for medical treatment. The villagers instead offer a trade of gems in exchange for Cee. As Ezra asks about details of the offer, Cee flees the village and escapes pursuit by the villagers.After wandering the planet alone, Cee runs into Ezra once again. His wound has worsened considerably, and Cee helps him amputate his arm. The pair set out once more and soon arrives at the mercenary camp surrounding the queen's lair. After negotiating passage on the mercenaries' ship, Cee and Ezra attempt to fulfill their end of the contract and extract gems from the queen's lair. They fail several extraction attempts, and as their mercenary guard turns to report their failure, Ezra attacks and kills him. The commotion attracts the rest of the mercenaries, and a fight ensues. Several mercenaries are killed, and Ezra is gravely wounded. Cee tends to Ezra's wound, and the pair escape into orbit on the mercenaries' ship.(copied from Wikipedia)"

Outlaw King,2018,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6679794/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A true David vs. Goliath story of how the 14th century Scottish 'Outlaw King' Robert the Bruce used cunning and bravery to defeat the much larger and better equipped occupying English army. After being declared ""Outlaw"" by the occupying English Empire, Robert the Bruce (Chris Pine) raises an army of Scottish fighters in rebellion. Twists and turns all across the Scottish countryside lead this film on an epic, ""true to historical events"", journey that captures heroism at its core!—Nick Chupick The film opens outside Stirling Castle in Scotland in 1304. Robert the Bruce, his rival John Comyn, and other Scottish nobility swear fealty to King Edward I of England. William Wallace, the infamous Scottish rebel, having been defeated at the Battle of Falkirk (1298) has gone into hiding and the English have won the upper hand in the fight against their northern neighbor's attempt at independence.With no other choice, many of the Scottish lords have decided to submit once more to English rule. For his part, Robert is promised the hand of Elizabeth de Burgh - an Irish noblewoman whose father is a close friend and ally to Edward I. When one Scotsman - James Douglas - petitions the King for the return of his family's lands and titles, Edward I refuses on the grounds that his father was traitor.As the noblemen begin to depart, Robert is challenged to a friendly duel by the English King's son Edward II whom he half-heartedly fights to a standstill before the Prince is summoned by his father and all are invited to watch as Edward I seals the treaty with the Scots by launching Greek fire at the nearby castle and telling his commanders to accept the fortress' surrender now.Back home, Robert and his father begin to deal with the realities of their submission and Elizabeth soon arrives to officially marry Robert (who chooses not to consummate the marriage). As the months go by, Elizabeth slowly begins to warm up to Robert and his daughter Marjorie while the strain of England's rule takes its toll on the common people.One night, Robert's father recounts stories from his youth when he fought alongside King Edward in the Crusades and, despite believing him to be a friend, ultimately regrets trusting him. Robert's father then passes away shortly afterwards, making him the new lord of Annandale.Some time later in 1305, Robert and his retinue travel to the border city of Berwick to deliver taxes owed to England. After doing so, Robert and his men are swept up in a mob of people who've gathered in the marketplace to view the arm of William Wallace - the rebel having finally been caught and subsequently hanged, drawn, and quartered. As the mass of people begin to shout and threaten the English soldiers, violence erupts and Robert watches in horror as the English begin cutting down Scottish commoners who respond in kind.Returning to his lands, Robert gathers together his friends and allies and shares the news of Wallace's execution and his renewed desire to cast off English rule once again - ultimately deciding to call together the Scottish nobility and make his case for a second attempt at independence. While some nobles side with him, others - namely John Comyn and those that support him - refuse.Robert is eventually confronted by Comyn in a church and the two exchange tense words. When the latter shares his intention of informing King Edward of his plans, Robert draws Comyn's knife from his belt and stabs him in the neck - killing him at the altar.Seeking absolution for his actions, Robert confesses the murder to the Scottish clergy who in turn offer him what he seeks in exchange for agreeing to be named King of Scotland and leading the country against the English. Robert accepts the offer and is crowned King in the village of Scone, encountering James Douglas along the way who pledges his service to Robert in exchange for the promise that his family's lands and titles will be returned to him.Back in England, Edward I receives word of Comyn's murder and Robert's crowning - infuriating him. Unable to lead the army himself due to his deteriorating health he charges Aymer de Valence to deal with the Scots who've been sighted in force near Perth. When Prince Edward II pleads with his father to let him prove himself by killing or capturing Robert, the King reluctantly agrees and knights hundreds of men to accompany his son, ordering them to ride under the banner of a dragon - ignoring the tenants of chivalry and showing no mercy to the enemy and/or their supporters.Robert meets with de Valence in the field and seeing his force heavily outnumbered challenges the English commander to single combat to decide the victor. De Valence accepts but tells Robert that since it's a Sunday the duel will have to take place the following day. That night, the Scots celebrate and prepare themselves for battle encamped in a nearby forest and after Robert and Elizabeth share a quiet moment they passionately consummate their marriage. Afterwards, as they put Marjorie to bed Robert makes Elizabeth promise that no matter what happens to him she will protect his daughter.Hearing strange noises outside their tent, Robert goes to investigate and volleys of fire-arrows begin to rain down on the Scottish camp. De Valence, choosing not to hold to their agreement, has moved his forces into range and attacked under cover of darkness (Battle of Methven). As the English continue their attack and rout most of the Scots, Robert entrusts his brother Neil to escort Elizabeth and Marjorie to Kildrummy Castle and seek refuge from Lord Fraser - a friend and ally.Despite putting up a furious resistance, Robert is pulled away from the inevitable defeat and escapes with only about fifty of his men still alive.Beaten, bloodied, and desperate, Robert and his men aimlessly wander the Scottish countryside eventually deciding to make for the home islands of one of his allies - Angus MacDonald - in the hopes of replenishing his forces. Along the way they're intercepted by a small force from the MacDougall clan who, despite being supporters of the murdered Comyn, allow them to pass by unharmed.Elsewhere, Neil delivers Elizabeth and Marjorie to Lord Fraser's castle - finding some respite from the quickly deteriorating situation Robert's crowning has created.When Robert and his men come to a river, they attempt to cross only to be ambushed by the MacDougalls. In the melee, Robert's brother Alexander is impaled by a spear and his body left behind as the outlaw king's forces dwindle further. Eventually finding their way to the islands the small group of soldiers rest and recover and those who're able to pledge to join his forces.Back on the mainland, Prince Edward II cuts a bloody path through Scotland mercilessly killing Robert's supporters and pillaging or capturing towns and villages - including Robert's own castle. When he arrives at Perth he berates de Valence for letting the outlaw escape and his ineptitude in tracking him down. Shortly after, a loyal Scottish nobleman arrives and informs the English of the whereabouts of Elizabeth and Marjorie and the Prince gathers his men to confront Lord Fraser.Arriving at Kildrummy, the Prince commands Lord Fraser to hand over Robert's wife and daughter lest he must attack. While the lord buys some time by claiming ignorance to their whereabouts, Neil sneaks Elizabeth and Marjorie outside the walls and tells them to wait and hide in the forest until he can send men to protect them and spirit them away. After unleashing a hail of fire-arrows into the castle, Lord Fraser offers to open the gates and allow the English entry.When both Neil and Lord Fraser continue to claim that Elizabeth and Marjorie are not there, Prince Edward II signals his men to approach to show that they've already captured them. Unhappy with their defiance, the Prince orders Neil to be hanged from the castle gates and is subsequently disemboweled in front of his wife and child. He then slits Lord Fraser's throat himself and orders Robert's wife and daughter be returned to England as hostages.On the island, Robert is informed of Neil's execution and his family's capture. The desire for revenge burning within him, the outlaw king returns to the mainland and continues to gather resources and allies - eventually coming to the conclusion that fighting the English head-on will only result in defeat as his forces are still dwarfed by their enemy. The Scots instead launch a campaign of guerrilla-warfare, striking English fortifications in small groups and taking the enemy by surprise. After defeating the garrison at his own castle (and setting it ablaze), Robert allows James Douglas to take a handful of men to do the same at his own keep.Douglas infiltrates his family's castle on Palm Sunday (the Douglas Larder) and during mass when most of the English garrison is praying inside the church he reveals himself and chants ""Douglas!"" over and over as his men proceed to brutally kill their enemies and set fire to the castle before gathering supporters to his cause and rejoining Robert.In England, Marjorie is taken away by a nun to serve as a glorified hostage at a convent while Elizabeth's parents are brought to her and with Prince Edward II attempt to convince her to sign a document that forsakes Robert, annuls their marriage, and pardons her for her ""crimes"" against the crown. When Elizabeth refuses to sign it and laughs at the Prince for his continued inability to capture her husband she's thrown in a metal cage and suspended over the walls.King Edward I meanwhile continues to become more and more aware of his frailty and failing health. When he receives word of yet another raid by Robert's forces he becomes irate and decides to muster his army and lead them into Scotland himself - intent on ending the rebellion personally just as he had when he defeated William Wallace at Falkirk almost a decade previous.On the march; however, King Edward I faints and on his deathbed instructs his son to boil his body and carry his bones with him to every battle he fights against the Scottish. As the King succumbs to dysentery the Prince's final words to his father are not loving as he mocks him and claims that the reason why his father treated him so poorly was because he knew his son was much stronger than himself and he was afraid of that strength. Before leaving his dead father's tent, Edward II instructs his men to bury the late King's body there and now - dismissing his last request.As the English draw closer and closer Robert decides to finally meet them in a pitched battle rather than continue to run and hide. Despite his men's uncertainty they choose to put their faith in their King and go about preparations - choosing a swampy battlefield to meet the English on and constructing large ditches filled with sharpened stakes to surprise the English heavy cavalry.James Douglas is tasked with intercepting the Prince and offering them battle at the designated spot and the two forces meet on the field the next day: the English numbering in the thousands while Robert's army is barely above five-hundred strong (the Battle of Loudoun Hill). Eager to prove himself and secure his position as the new King of England, Edward II orders de Valence and many of his heavy cavalry to charge Robert's waiting army. Too late do the English see the traps set for them and as both horses and knights fall victim to the stake-lined pits a brutal muddy melee ensues. Even after Edward II himself enters the battle with the remainder of his men the Scots continue to cut down Englishmen and soon send them into a rout.Once more, Robert and Edward II duel with the former emerging victorious. Battered and begging for help, Edward II is spared by Robert and allowed to retreat with what's left of his army as the Scottish King claims his first major victory against the English.In an epilogue sequence it's revealed that Edward II would return to England and be made King only to be murdered by his nobles years later. James Douglas would go on to earn the nickname ""the Black Douglas"" and earn his family's lands back while Angus MacDonald would be made Lord of the Isles. Elizabeth is eventually set free in a prisoner exchange and rejoins Robert and Marjorie, and three-hundred years later one of Robert's descendants, James VI would be crowned King of Scotland and England."

The festivities are interrupted by a massive fire that has been set by those involved with the land dispute, and the party-goers rush to try to put it out.Back at home, Cleo takes the children to a movie and sees Antonio frolicking there with another woman. Later, Cleo goes to Ramon to try to find Fermin's location, and he takes her out to the martial arts training area where Fermin is being trained. The organization training camp set up by the United States, three American men are seen training hundreds of youth's martial arts, Fermín is a supporter of Luis Echeverría Álvarez and his initials are seen in the hill in the scene where they are practicing martial arts. In this scene, three Americans are seen and possibly one in C.I.A. disguise.Cleo tries to tell Fermin she's having his baby, but he denies it's his and threatens to beat her if she ever tries to talk to him again.At home, Sofia is on the phone with a friend talking about how Antonio is pretending to be in Canada for the children and doesn't even have the guts to tell them, and Paco begins eavesdropping. Cleo tries to shoo him, but Sofia sees and enraged, slaps Paco and yells at Cleo. She instantly apologizes and begs Paco not to tell his siblings.Teresa (Veronica Garcia), Sofia's mother who also lives with them, takes Cleo to a department store to buy a crib for her baby. Students are protesting outside the building, and the protests turn violent. A man and woman run into the store bleeding and screaming, followed by men with guns who point guns at all the store patrons. They kill the man who was hiding, and we see that the man pointing a gun at Cleo was Fermin.
Fermín is posing as a student and is seen as part a resistance group in 1971 which was the Corpus Christi festival.
When she sees Fermin involved the shock causes Cleo's water breaks and Teresa rushes her to the hospital, making their way there through horrible traffic caused by the protests. Teresa checks Cleo in, and her doctor can't find a heartbeat, so they rush her to surgery. On the way she sees Antonio - he tells her everything is going to be okay, but when Cleo's doctor says Antonio can go into the operating room he makes an excuse to get out of it. In the operating room, the doctors fight their hardest, but Cleo's daughter is stillborn.Cleo is despondent and depressed but returns to work. Sofia tells the kids that they are going on a weekend trip to a beach town. She invites Cleo to come, not as a maid, but as a guest, hoping it will be good for her. Cleo declines, but Adela and Sofia eventually get her to agree. They drive out to Tuxpan, and at dinner, Sofia tells the children that their father never went to Canada and that he's not coming home. The weekend trip was so he could get his belongings out of the house. The kids cry and are upset, but Sofia is strong and promises them everything is going to be alright and that it will be an adventure. She tells them she's leaving her professor job and getting a new job in publishing.At the beach, Sofia leaves for a moment with Toño while Paco and Sofi want to swim. She tells them they can as long as they stay in the shallow end by the shore, because Cleo can't swim. While Cleo is tending to Pepe, she realizes she can't see the other two children in the water. She runs out into the water, despite not knowing how to swim, and goes out to the two children who have been carried out by the current. She rescues them and brings them back to the shore as Sofia and the other children run up in shock. The kids exclaim that Cleo saved them, and the whole family hugs. Cleo begins crying, saying that she never wanted her baby, wracked with guilt. The family keeps hugging her.Back at home, the family arrives to see much missing since Antonio has cleared it out. The family together begins adjusting to their new way of life, falling back into their usual routine, Cleo along with them, things seeming to get better, everyone coming out of their different pain together."

The Cloverfield Paradox,2018,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2548396/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Orbiting a planet on the brink of war, scientists test a device to solve an energy crisis, and end up face-to-face with a dark alternate reality. In the near future, there is an energy crisis on Earth. The Cloverfield Station with a multinational crew will test the Shepard particle accelerator expecting to generate energy for all countries solving the energy problem. However, the experiment goes wrong, damages the station and opens a portal to another dimension with a parallel Earth. They also find a woman entwined with wires behind a bulkhead of the station and they learn she worked in an identical Cloverfield Station in another dimension. Now the scientists need to find a way to return to their own dimension.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil As the Earth keeps depleting its limited resources and a dreadful energy crisis threatens to plunge the globe into a new dark era of destruction and turmoil, a gleam of hope lies in a small crew of scientists at the Cloverfield Station in space. Believed to produce unrestrained amounts of energy, the highly experimental Sherpard particle accelerator is a machine that could either save humanity or it could rip holes in the fabric of reality--and soon--strange occurrences due to unexplained malfunctions will give birth to shocking discoveries. Who can harness the unfathomable powers that have been unwisely released?—Nick Riganas Before the movie starts, an off-screen news broadcast informs the viewer that the situation on Earth is quickly deteriorating due to an imminent energy crisis which is causing several countries to threaten war. The film opens with Hamilton (Gugu Mbatha-Raw), a British scientist, waiting in a car with her husband, Michael (Roger Davies). They are stuck in a traffic jam and discuss the frequent blackouts happening around them due to the energy crisis. We learn that Hamilton received an invitation to take part in a mission aboard the space station Cloverfield in order to test the Shepard particle accelerator, which will provide the Earth with infinite energy if operational. As the title sequence appears, the film now takes place on station two years into the mission, as the crew is testing the Shepard for the umpteenth time. The crew consists of Hamilton; Schmidt (Daniel Brühl), a German scientist working on the Shepard; Tam (Ziyi Zhang), a Chinese scientist also working on the Shepard; Volkov (Aksel Hennie), a Russian scientist in charge of life support and ensuring that the ship's electronics are properly functioning; Monk (John Ortiz), a Brazilian and the crew doctor; Mundy (Chris O'Dowd), an Irish technician; and Kiel (David Oyelowo), the American crew commander. The test fails, with the particle accelerator failing to output more energy than is being input into it.Hamilton is seen talking over a webcam-like communication to her husband on Earth, informing him that the test failed and that they only have enough fuel for three more tests. On board the ship, tensions between the crew grow, with Volkov accusing Schmidt of taking his time with the tests while the former's mother country of Russia is nearing desperately low levels of energy and is threatening war on the Western world. Schmidt denies these allegations, while Kiel attempts to defuse the situation. The crew gears up for yet another test, while Monk watches a news report on Earth. In said news report, a man named Mark Stambler (Donal Logue) is being interviewed, who warns that if the Shepard becomes operational, it may open an inter-dimensional gateway that could lead ""monsters, demons, and beasts from the sea"" to enter the current dimension, but also other dimensions and past and future timelines. The crew dismisses it as nonsense and begins the test. This time, it appears that the particle accelerator works; however, it quickly overloads, creating an energy output far above normal levels. It catches fire, and the condensation system used to cool it down fails to work, leading Tam to suggest ventilating the system instead. Upon fixing this, the crew discovers to their horror that they are no longer orbiting the Earth. They originally assume that they may have destroyed the planet accidentally when testing the Shepard, but later come to the conclusion that they have been warped to an entirely different part of the galaxy.The crew discovers that the gyro (a navigational object that allows the ship to get its bearings) has inexplicably gone missing, as they begin hearing horrifying screams coming from the walls. After opening the wall panel where the screams originate, they discover to their great shock a young woman (Elizabeth Debicki) inside it, fused with electrical wires. They are able to rescue her and use an advanced medical bay to restore her body to a healthy condition, but are taken aback by the fact that she seems to know Hamilton. Back on Earth, Michael awakens to a gigantic explosion. He checks his phone and sees conflicting reports assuming the Russians attacked the city, then discovers ""something else"" was the cause. He decides to head down to the hospital where he works to help the presumed victims.Meanwhile, Volkov begins to feel something crawling underneath his skin, and discovers that his eyes are moving out of orbit on their own. After facing the mirror and seemingly talking to himself, he overrides the security controls of an on board 3D printer to craft a handgun and ammunition. He then confronts Schmidt on X-Deck (the area where the Shepard can be repaired from) and points his gun at him and Tam, accusing the German of working for his country's spy agency. He suddenly collapses on the ground and is taken to the ship's bridge, where he begins convulsing and suddenly has worms that had previously gone missing from the ship's laboratory explode from inside his body, killing him. Speaking to the young woman in the medical bay, Hamilton discovers that her name is Jensen, and that she claims to be a crew member of the Cloverfield and to know all of the members on the ship except for Tam. She then warns Hamilton that Schmidt is not to be trusted. Upon an off-screen investigation, Kiel discovers that the German is indeed working for the German government and is tasked with purposely sabotaging the Shepard in an effort to cause Russia to collapse due to the energy crisis. Schmidt vehemently denies this, but Kiel locks him into a containment area until further notice.Michael is talking on the phone to a contact at the space agency, who tells him they lost contact with the station his wife is on. Something catches his attention, and he stops the car in front of a destroyed building. Through the smoke, a gigantic shadowy figure is briefly seen, which then disappears as a child (Clover Nee) is heard crying for help. Michael goes to help her.As Mundy is repairing the wall panel they opened earlier, his arm is suddenly sucked into the wall panel. Kiel and Hamilton arrive to pull him out, and soon discover that his arm is no longer attached to his body. Monk remarks that it looks like he was born without an arm, rather than it being violently severed from his body. Meanwhile, Schmidt is let out of the containment area by an unknown presence. To his bewilderment, he discovers Mundy's arm crawling around the ship on its own. The rest of the crew arrives and captures it, and discover that the arm is attempting to tell them something. After the crew gives it a pen, the arm compels them in writing to open Volkov's body. They do so, discovering the missing gyro inside the Russian's body. After fitting the gyro back into its slot, they discover that they are still in the Solar System, yet the Earth is on the opposite side of the Sun. They re-establish communications with the planet and discover through broadcast news that there has been a global war over energy raging for the last fourteen months, and that the Cloverfield station was destroyed long ago. They arrive at the conclusion that the Shepard opened a gateway to another dimension, which they traveled to and which caused all of the anomalies on the ship to happen. They are now so far away from the Earth because while their location did not change, the Earth's orbit caused it to move to a different point on its path fourteen months into the future. The dimension they find themselves in is not their dimension, but it's Jensen's dimension, as well as presumably the dimension of Mundy's arm. This also explains how Jensen knows the crew, why she doesn't know Tam (she has the same role as Tam on the station and therefore was the crew member who replaced her in her dimension), and why they believe Schmidt to be a spy (his counterpart in Jensen's dimension was indeed working for the German government).They theorize that by recreating the last test with the Shepard, they will be able to return to their own dimension. Back on Earth, Michael and the child, whose name is Molly, drive to a friend's shelter in order to stay safe during the mysterious ongoing conflict in the city. On the ship, Tam discovers that the Shepard failed because condensation caused by the cooling system threw off the data she received at the end of each test. Ventilation, on the other hand, would have created the necessary conditions for a stable beam. She goes into one of the airlocks to attempt testing such a theory, but she finds herself locked inside it as water pours out of the condensation system, filling the room. The other crew members attempt to free her but are forced to watch in horror as the water creates pressure on the outer door of the air lock and breaks it open, causing the water to freeze instantly and killing Tam. In order to get the Shepard up and running, Kiel decides to entrust Jensen in taking Tam's place on X-Deck, since the two shared the same role in their respective dimensions' crews.In the shelter, Michael is on the phone with his contact at the space agency when loud noises and heavy shaking cause him and Molly to panic and the power to go off. Jensen informs Hamilton that her children, who died in the latter's dimension after she installed a power core in their home that failed and caused the house to burn down, are alive and well in Jensen's dimension. This leads her to deciding to stay in this dimension. She informs Kiel of this decision, who is reluctant at first but comes to accept it. The crew realize that they need to reroute power from other systems to the Shepard to provide the necessary yield, and decide to shut down the life support, leaving a mere two hours of
oxygen for the crew. Mundy undertakes the task of doing so in a small storage room and succeeds, but a magnetic disturbance causes his tools and a gas canister to fly towards the wall, causing an explosion that kills him and destroys a part of the ship. Kiel, Hamilton, and Monk are forced to go into the damaged part of the ship and jettison it into space in order to save the remainder of it. Upon arriving there, Kiel realizes that he needs to close the air lock behind him to do so, and sacrifices himself to save the rest of his crew. On Earth, Michael records a message on his phone to Hamilton, telling her that the only thing they can do is save the people that they still can.On the station, the remainder of the crew hastens to put their plan to fruition, with Hamilton informing Schmidt and Monk of her decision to stay in the alternate dimension. Jensen secretly takes the handgun that Volkov had and brings it with her and Hamilton to the escape shuttle, where she knocks Hamilton unconscious with it and proceeds to return to X-Deck. Hamilton regains consciousness in time to hear Jensen shoot Monk, finding him dying when she follows the sound. She then arrives to X-Deck to see Jensen pointing the gun at an injured Schmidt's head. Jensen informs Hamilton of her decision to keep the Cloverfield station in her dimension because it would save the people of her planet, rationalizing that she would gladly kill three people to save eight billion. Schmidt uses a nearby metal rod to knock her to the ground, allowing Hamilton the opportunity to escape. In the ensuing struggle, Schmidt is shot in the shoulder. Jensen hunts Hamilton through the ship, who takes her by surprise and attempts to wrestle the gun from her. Unable to secure the gun for herself, Hamilton decides to fire three rounds into a nearby window, opening the room to the vacuum of space and causing Jensen to be sucked out, killing her.Instead of staying in the alternate dimension, Hamilton decides to record an audio message warning her counterpart of the dangerous power cell inside the house, and attaches the data for the Shepard to function properly to the message. Then, she and Schmidt overload the Shepard again, allowing them to return to their dimension. They make radio contact with Earth and successfully establish a stable beam for the Shepard, completing their original mission. They inform the Earth of this, and prepare to jettison down to the surface now that an infinite energy source has been created. Meanwhile, Michael's agency contact informs him of their success, and tells him that they are returning to the surface. Michael angrily responds that they should not have been allowed to return to the Earth while ""these things"" were roaming the surface. The last shot shows the shuttle crossing the cloud barrier, immediately followed by a gigantic monster very similar to the creature that destroyed New York City in Cloverfield (2008), albeit far larger, breaking through the clouds and letting out a terrifying roar."

The Vanishing,2018,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4131496/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Three lighthouse keepers on the remote Flannan Isles find a hidden trunk of gold, leading to their mysterious disappearance. Based on the Flannan Isle mystery. A small relief boat approaches a tiny, isolated island where a lighthouse is located. They're to replenish the stocks and replace the crew of 3. After they dock no one greets them. The winch is broken. The lamps are clean and refilled; the table's laid for dinner. There's an upturned chair, 2 sets of yellow oilskins are missing - the 3 men have vanished.—Andy Evans On an uninhabited island 20 miles from the rugged Scottish coast, three lighthouse keepers arrive for their 6 week shift. As Thomas (Peter Mullan), James (Gerard Butler) and Donald (Connor Swindells) settle into their normal quiet routine, something unexpected, potentially life-changing occurs - they stumble upon gold. Where did it come from? Who does it belong to? A boat appears in the distance that might hold the answer to these questions - What follows is a tense battle for survival, fed by isolation, paranoia and greed, leading three honest men down a path to destruction.—Andy Evans The Saban Films release ""The Vanishing,"" with Gerard Butler, Peter Mullan, Connor Swindells, Soren Malling, Olafur Darri Olafsson and Gary Lewis.Also known as ""The Flannan Isle Mystery,"" where in December 1900 investigators find that the Scotland west coast lighthouse abandoned by the three men employed there. This story became inspiring a famous poem by Wilfrid Wilson Gibson, his epic, Flannan Isle. There are also more recent artistic representations in various media, from a novel, an opera, and a video game.To date there has been no conclusion to what had happened to these men, James Ducat, Thomas Marshall and Donald MacArthur. There have been theories over the years that the men were killed by pirates, eaten by animals and maybe kidnapped by aliens.
However, ""The Vanishing"" seems to be falling between the stools of thriller and drama the tale grows steadily but really never reaches a credible outcome even with the powerful actors such as Gerard Butler and Peter Mullan.After a storm, Donald makes a discovery down a deep crevice a dead man and his remnants of a small rowboat. When the young man (Connor Swindells) is lowered to validate the man has died. However, once down the man springs to life and there is a huge struggle between the two men. The young man (Connor Swindells) is forced to kill the man or be killed. It comes to light that the man was protecting this small chest that stored gold bars. This is unknown to the three light house caretakers at the time.The gold bars bring two more men to the island (Soren Malling and Olafur Darri Olafsson), who are seeking the man who had been killed. In this movie adaptation there are periods of vagueness of the story and this is one of them. There is no clarification of where the gold is from, why was their mate washed up in a crevice with the gold. The viewer is left to formulate their own conclusions.The story outlined by Celyn Jones and Joe Bone do not clarify if this is a crime melodrama or a psychological thriller. Nor does Danish director Kristoffer Nyholm, making his theatrical feature debut after numerous well-received TV cliffhangers (""The Killing,"" Taboo"" and The Enfield Haunting"") do a good job of having the audience truly understand what is going on. Leaving them with a bland and weak story that never comes home.""The Vanishing"" starts slowly and continues slow throughout the film never gaining a decent momentum. Johansson's widescreen cinematography, and other tech/design contributions does capture the viewers' attention but never delivers the overall expectation of a movie with Gerald Butler in it. There are fighting scenes, killing scenes and bloody scenes with no conformity of reason or definition of actions or clarity of story. High character conflict with sometimes moderate suspense just never delivers a good solid logical premise for the vanishing of these here men.So, of the three men, one is killed (Connor Swindells) by another (Gerard Butler). No one really knows why. Then the man that kills that character (Gerard Butler) is driven on the ocean with the boat that was used by the two earlier men seeking the gold who had been killed by the three. Here you see the third character (Peter Mullan) slips the first character (Connor Swindells) slipped into the ocean after a good bye kiss from the third character (Peter Mullan), then the 2nd character (Gerard Butler) slip off the boat into the ocean off an idling boat and come back up where the third and last of the three caretakers (Peter Mullan) holds his the 2nd character (Gerard Butler) under water so he drowns and slips deep into the ocean. Then the movie is over fade to black with the third character (Peter Mullan) still on the boat. Leaving the viewer to draw their own conclusion of what the third man (Peter Mullan) does. Uneventful, curious, and very unsatisfying. ""The Vanishing"" is a great base story and could have been a good thriller with excitement and interactions between the players if just written better and with a better overall concept of the story. Easily could have been a great movie. After seeing it, the viewers are left with unanswered questions and bewilderment. Its sad to see an ""ALMOST,"" great movie experience. The story falls short to fulfill even basic true elements of the"" Flannan Isle mystery."" - Martin Snytshuvel"

A stolid, old guard policeman, Ridgeman (Gibson) and his volatile younger partner, Lurasetti (Vaughn), find themselves suspended when a video of them strong-arming a suspect becomes the media's special du jour. Low on cash and with no other options, these two embittered soldiers descend into the criminal underworld to gain their just due. On the other side of the law, Henry Jones comes home from years in prison to find his mother and disabled brother living in squalor. The ex-convict needs a way to help and to this end, his childhood friend Biscuit introduces him to a ruthless crime boss whose ambitious plans put him and his pal in direct conflict with the two renegade officers. In the hardboiled world of DRAGGED ACROSS CONCRETE, who lives, who dies, and who gets rich is a fate written in bullets.—Bloom Media After being suspended from duty for 6 weeks, unpaid, Mel.Gibson thinks about his family's relocation and his own retirement. Enlisting his police cop partner, Vince Vaughn, to help him they plan to get a retirement fund by tapping into a robbery that is due to go down. They plan to rob the thieves, but things don't go exactly as planned due to mistrust between the thieves. This meticulous film explores the stories of the thieves and suspended police officers and their fates.—leefreeman99 Brett Ridgeman (Mel Gibson) and Anthony Lurasetti (Vince Vaughn) are a pair of police officers working the urban beat in the city of Bulwark. During a drug bust, the older, more volatile Ridgeman becomes unnecessarily rough with a suspect, using his foot to jam the man's face into a fire escape. They also pour cold water on and mock the suspect's partially-deaf girlfriend. The former act is caught on video, and the two men called before their superior, Lt. Calvert (Don Johnson). Although Ridgeman asks that Lurasetti be spared from any sort of reprisal, Calvert is forced to suspend both men without pay in order to appease the media. With Ridgeman's wife Melanie (Laurie Holden) unable to work due to illness and Lurasetti preparing to propose to his fiancee, the men resolve to use the criminal connections they have developed through their time in law enforcement to make cash that will sustain them until their suspensions are lifted. Through Friedrich (Udo Kier), a wealthy businessman and criminal associate who owes him a favor, Ridgeman gets a lead on a score from Lorentz Vogelman (Thomas Kretschmann).Meanwhile, recently released ex-con Henry Johns (Tory Kittles), hoping to finance better opportunities for his drug-addicted, prostitute mother and his bright but wheelchair-bound little brother, joins up with his childhood friend Biscuit (Michael Jai White) for a mysterious but lucrative job. Their employer turns out to be Vogelman, who uses them as getaway drivers and lookouts for a bank robbery. Ridgeman and Lurasetti tail Vogelman's crew, quickly identifying the telltale signs of a bank robbery; though Lurasetti considers calling the robbery in, Ridgeman convinces him to allow them to carry out the job before robbing them in turn.Holding up the bank for a score of gold bullion, Vogelman and his cronies sadistically execute several employees, including Kelly Summer (Jennifer Carpenter), a teller on her first day back from maternity leave. The brutality does not sit well with either Henry or Biscuit, who quickly realize they are likely expendable to Vogelman. Lurasetti is also wracked with guilt over he and Ridgeman's inaction as they tail the robbers to a rendezvous point in the countryside.As the bank robbers arrive at their checkpoint, Henry and Biscuit turn on them, leading to a shootout in which Biscuit is killed, one of Vogelman's henchman is wounded, and Henry escapes. Ridgeman and Lurasetti arrive, and an extended standoff with the bank robbers ensues. Vogelman blackmails his hostage by threatening her family, having her crawl to the off-duty cops and shoot Lurasetti when his guard is down. Ridgeman kills the hostage, and a dying Lurasetti listens to a voicemail from his girlfriend in which she refused his marriage proposal. Ridgeman finishes off Vogelman and his crew all by himself, but is ambushed by Henry, who recorded a video of Ridgeman killing the hostage as blackmail material. After a brief physical altercation, the two call a truce, agreeing to clean up the crime scene together, bury their friends and split the gold. They cooperate, and the job is nearly done when Ridgeman pulls a gun on Henry, demanding he delete the video he recorded despite Henry's insistence that his word is good. Panicked, Henry pulls his own gun and shoots Ridgeman in self-defense. Henry chastises a dying Ridgeman, but assures him that Ridgeman's family will be taken care of regardless.Nearly a year later, Henry is shown living in a lavish mansion with his mother and brother. Ridgeman's wife and daughter receive a package in the mail, sent by Henry, containing a cigar box full of gold bullion."
Cam,2018,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8361028/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Alice, an ambitious camgirl, wakes up one day to discover she's been replaced on her show with an exact replica of herself. In Daniel Goldhaber and Isa Mazzei's paranoid horror thriller ""Cam,"" an erotic webcam performer finds her followers stolen by a doppelganger who hijacks her channel, pushes the sexual envelope further, and otherwise seems determined to destroy her life. Call it identity theft of a possibly supernatural kind.—Hugo Van Herpe Alice Ackerman works as a camgirl on a website called FreeGirlsLive, broadcasting sexually promiscuous live shows from a studio she has set up in her home under the name ""Lola_Lola."" She is obsessed with her rank on the site, hoping to be number 1, a spot currently held by a camgirl named BabyGirl. Her mother is unaware of her career, believing that she works in web development. Her younger brother, Jordan, knows about Alice's job and has agreed to keep it a secret, though he persuades Alice to tell their mother the truth someday.One night, in the middle of a show, an anonymous user encourages her to perform self-mutilating acts using a knife. She blocks the user, only for him to return and make increasingly disturbing requests. Her viewer count and rank both rapidly increase as various users either encourage her to go through with the suicide or beg her not to. She eventually complies and slits her throat on-camera with a knife, before revealing that the suicide was staged using makeup. As she ends her stream, she receives a call from ""TinkerBoy,"" a loyal viewer of hers whose real name is Arnold. In the ensuing conversation, it is revealed that the anonymous user persuading her to commit suicide was in fact Arnold, and that the two of them planned the encounter in order to increase Lola's popularity. Arnold reveals he is searching for jobs and considering moving out of his state. Alice then abruptly ends her call with Arnold after receiving a call from Barney, another loyal Lola fan. One day, while shopping for party supplies for Jordan's birthday party, she sees Arnold in the store. Though they don't acknowledge each other, they both clearly instantly recognize one another.Alice later video chats with another camgirl, Fox, and the two discuss how to improve their ranks. Fox suggests meeting at Cam Girl Clubhouse to do a ""control show,"" in which one of the girls inserts a vibrator into the other and controls it via a remote. Alice suggests using a ""Vibratron,"" a vibrator known for being extremely powerful. Fox is reluctant, but Alice promises she'll be the one to ride the vibrator. Fox still refuses. Later that night, Alice video calls with Barney again. She mentions that he will be in her area next week and offers to meet up in-person. She writes down the date and location before Barney suddenly logs off.During her next show, Alice finally reaches the top 50. She begins to celebrate and enthusiastically thank her viewers, but her rank quickly drops - she then discovers that a rival camgirl, Princess_X, who has a strict ""no nude"" policy, is promising to get naked on camera if Lola's rank drops back to 60. Lola drops to 59, much to Princess' chagrin. Lola awkwardly thanks her viewers before ending the stream. She then receives a call on her cell phone from Arnold, who expresses sympathy for her and disdain towards Princess. Alice asks why he is calling her on her personal phone rather than on FGL, since she only gave him her number to use in case of emergency. Arnold explains that he has been worried after Alice repeatedly ignored his FGL calls. Alice then asks him to confirm that it was him she saw in the store earlier that day. Arnold reveals that he received a job in Alice's state and is currently staying in a motel, though searching for a permanent place of residence. Alice is clearly uncomfortable at the possibility that Arnold may have moved to her state just to be closer to her, though he insists that it was merely a coincidence. She abruptly ends the phone call before contacting Fox and asserts that they will be doing the control show.While at Cam Girl Clubhouse, Alice runs into Princess_X and another camgirl, LuckyDuck, who mock her and coyly wish her luck on the show. The control show is a huge success, bringing Alice's rank back up to 47. The following morning, Alice attempts to log into her FGL account, but finds that all of her login information has been changed. When she searches for ""Lola,"" she finds that the account is still active and currently streaming. Curious, she logs into a spare account to watch the stream and sees someone with her exact appearance and mannerisms playing in a bathtub with bubbles and bath toys - even their studio is an exact replica of Alice's. She hears her own voice coming from her studio, and apprehensively enters, only to find that nobody is there, but that the TV in her studio is playing the stream. Alice contacts the site's customer service, believing that they are replaying old shows, but they assure her that this is impossible. Alice looks back through her calendar - on which she has written a brief description of each livestream for every single day - to match a date to the bathtub livestream, but cannot find anything. FGL customer support claims that they can't do much since the account is live and the performer matches the identification they have on file. Alice logs into a spare account and messages the chat that she is the real Lola and that FGL is replaying an old show, but is quickly blocked from the channel. Alice then creates a new account under the name ""MrTeapot."" When her attempts to private chat with ""Lola"" fail, she messages the chat demanding to know what is happening. ""Lola"" sees the messages and greets the new user, directly addressing them as ""Teapot,"" proving that the stream is in fact live. Confused and afraid, Alice leaves the stream.Alice later meets up with LuckyDuck and Fox to explain the problem, showing them a livestream by the fake Lola in which she is wearing pasties and writing on her body with markers. LuckyDuck and Fox both seem skeptical, believing it to be an old show that is being replayed, but Alice proves them wrong when she tips ""Lola"" and asks her to say ""orange,"" which she does. Princess_X then arrives and notices the stream, as well as the real Lola sitting right in front of her. She comments on the strangeness of the situation, but is quick to dismiss it. Alice alludes that Princess is the one behind the account hijacking, but Princess asserts her innocence, claiming that if she were to go to the trouble of hijacking somebody's account, it would be somebody at least in the top ten. Frustrated, Alice leaves.The next day, while shopping for Jordan's birthday present, Alice contacts FGL customer support again for an update on the status of her report. When she divulges her access code, the representative tells her that the code is invalid. Alice asks to speak to a supervisor, but he cannot allow her to do so if he is unable to verify her identity. When she demands that he do more to help her, he asks her to calm down, leading her to angrily end the call. Alice drops off Jordan's gifts at the salon her mother works at. Arnold then shows up, offering her a bouquet and asking if he can meet her mother. Alice hastily dismisses him. Arnold is confused, claiming that during a private cam session last night, Alice confessed her love to him and expressed the desire to begin a real-life relationship with him. This is a breach of one of the ""rules"" Alice had set for herself - not telling any of her viewers that she loves them. Realizing that the doppelgänger was the one responsible for the private cam session, Lola angrily asserts that she didn't talk to Arnold last night before forcibly removing him from the salon.That night, Alice attempts to recreate her account, but is unable to do so due to her ID already being on file. She joins another Lola livestream to see the fake Lola masturbating and exposing herself in a public library, compromising another one of Alice's personal rules - not doing any shows in public. The stream is later uploaded onto Girls4Download, a website where old FGL shows can be uploaded, and watched by several of Jordan's friends while at his birthday party. Alice arrives right at that moment with the cake, and the boys awkwardly greet her, laughing and ridiculing her amongst themselves after she leaves. Right as they're about to prepare the cake, Jordan and one of his friends, Alex, abruptly barge into the room, with Jordan trying to wrestle a phone out of Alex's hands. Right as Alex loudly announces that Alice ""does porn,"" the phone is dropped and picked up by Alice's mother, who sees the stream. When the room falls silent, a humiliated Alice tries to apologize to her mother, but she says nothing back, only prepares the cake and begins singing the Happy Birthday song for Jordan. As all the party guests awkwardly join in, a distraught Alice leaves.That night, the fake Lola hosts an 80's workout themed show. Alice is infuriated when she notices that Lola's rank has hit 31. Blinded by rage, she impulsively buys tokens to tip the fake Lola and convinces her to spank herself to the point of bruising. The fake Lola then opens a chest of BDSM tools, using them to tease her audience before she abruptly pulls out a gun. As Lola dangerously plays with the gun, her rank continues to climb into the top 20. She requests 100,000 tokens in exchange for shooting herself in the mouth as the real Alice watches on in horror. The goal is met, and the fake Lola shoots herself in the mouth, sending Alice into a panic attack. Lola then gets up, revealing the suicide to have been staged. A sobbing Alice calls Fox, but is sent to voicemail, so she contacts the police instead. When two officers arrive at her house, both are largely unhelpful; one officer flirts with her by asking increasingly invasive questions about her job, and the other claims that Alice should simply not use the internet if she wants to avoid situations like this. The fake Lola then announces an upcoming live show with BabyGirl. Alice joins Baby's livestream and attempts to get in contact with her, to no avail. She grows suspicious when Baby mentions wanting to ""burn her house down so a fireman would take pity on her"" and ""needing to get fucked,"" both word-for-word phrases that the fake Lola had said in her livestreams.Alice calls Fox to ask if she has any information about Baby's real name or location. Fox laughs and dismisses her before abruptly hanging up. Alice meets up for her date with Barney the next day. As they share lunch, Alice cleverly manages to get Barney to reveal that Baby is from Oehler, Georgia and that she was crowned prom queen in high school. She excuses herself to the bathroom to further investigate on her phone, but ""Lola"" goes live right at that moment. Alice locks herself in a stall as Barney confronts her, accusing her of lying about her identity to try and scam him, but claims that they ""can still have some fun"" if she is honest about her true identity. When Alice tries to escape, Barney assaults her, but Alice frees herself by biting his hand, which he had been using to cover her mouth.During Lola and Baby's joint livestream, Alice uses the information provided by Barney to find Baby's real name, which is Hannah Darin. When she googles her, she discovers that Hannah had in fact passed away in a car crash six months prior. Alice deduces that the ""Baby"" currently streaming is also a doppelgänger, and that whatever is responsible for the Lola copy had created the Baby copy as well. While streaming, the Baby and Lola doubles divulge personal information about Alice, including revealing what the rest of her house outside her studio looks like. The fake Lola starts to share baby pictures of Alice, including a picture of Jordan, whereupon she also reveals his name. This distresses Alice to the point of destroying her laptop.Alice visits her childhood home to find that inflammatory remarks have been spray-painted on the side of it. When she goes inside and is faced with her mother, Alice explains that she planned to tell her mother the truth about her job eventually, but wanted to wait until she was ""good enough."" Alice's mother tells her that she watched some of the livestreams, and that she enjoys Alice's confidence when she acts as ""Lola,"" a stark contrast from her usual shy and sheltered personality. Alice tries to explain that the person in the livestreams isn't the real her, but her mother doesn't understand this as anything other than a metaphor for Lola being a persona that Alice adopts. She tries to show her mother a livestream to prove her point, but the fake Lola is not online at the moment. Jordan then enters, but is dismissive when Alice greets him, ignoring her even when she demands that he speak to her.Alice later visits a public library and uses their computer to search for other camgirls that she assumes to be doppelgängers, namely by searching for joint shows recorded by ""Baby"" after the real Hannah Darin's death. She notices that each of the fake girls have Arnold as their top friend, and seeks him out at the motel he mentioned he was staying at earlier. She apologizes for her crass behavior earlier and tearfully begs for his help. He offers to let her stay the night at his motel out of concern for her safety. After falling asleep, Alice wakes up in the middle of the night to find that Arnold is in the bathroom, masturbating in the middle of a private cam session with Lola. An enraged Alice attacks Arnold with a taser and demands answers from him. He reveals that he knows about the doppelgängers and that he can usually ""guess"" which girl is going to be replicated next. He promises, however, that he is not responsible for the replicas and that he isn't sure how how they work or why it happens. He professes his love for her as he swears his innocence. As an injured Arnold lays on the floor, Alice enters the bathroom and talks to the fake Lola from his computer. Lola greets her and asks if she is Arnold's girlfriend, making no comment about the fact that they look exactly alike. Alice deduces that the entity doesn't recognize what it is replicating. She hastily leaves while a distraught Arnold begs her to stay.Alice goes home and sets up her vanity mirror, camera, and television in a positions that creates an illusion showing multiples of her. She joins a private cam session with the fake Lola, who instantly recognizes her as ""Tinker's girlfriend,"" still apparently oblivious to the fact that they are identical. Alice tells her to sit at her vanity and put her monitor in front of her mirror, before suggesting she go live so everyone can see ""how good they look together."" The fake Lola enthusiastically agrees, and viewers chalk up the two Lolas to special effects. Alice challenges Lola to a game in which they must imitate each other - whoever the viewers think does the best job wins, and the winner may ask anything of the other. Lola wins the first round by blowing a kiss and telling her viewers she loves them - as her prize, she orders Alice to strip, which she does. Alice then smashes her head into her desk, triggering a nosebleed. Lola does the same - Alice convinces her viewers that the other ""Lola"" is fake when Lola emerges with her face completely unscathed. Lola then makes her face bleed on command, impressing her viewers with her use of ""special effects makeup."" Alice smashes her face into her desk harder, causing her nose to break. She is declared the winner and demands Lola's account password. Lola hesitates at first, but Alice says her viewers would never trust her again if she refuses. The audience agrees, and when Lola notices that her rank has dropped from 3 to 4, she complies, sending her Alice her password in a private message. Alice then logs into Lola's account and deletes it just as it reaches the number 1 rank.Some time later, Alice's mother does her makeup for her in preparation for an upcoming livestream. Her mother asks Alice what she will do if the same thing happens again, to which Alice responds that she will simply continue to recreate her accounts. It is revealed that Alice has gotten a fake ID containing the name ""Emily Ramsay."" She creates a new account under the name ""EveBot."" The movie ends just as ""Eve"" begins her first ever stream."

Parallel,2018,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4922674/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A group of friends stumble upon a mirror that serves as a portal to a ""multiverse"", but soon discover that importing knowledge from the other side in order to better their lives brings increasingly dangerous consequences. In Seattle, Devin (Aml Ameen) is sharing a spooky house with fellow app designers Noel, Leena and Josh (Martin Wallstrom, Georgia King and Mark O'Brien). One day they discover a secret part of the house with a mirror portal into parallel realities that are all slightly different. So they start exploring, spying on other versions of themselves while mapping inter-connections. They also use it to finish their app and make a pile of cash. A bit too late, they read the journal by Marissa (Kathleen Quinlan), who used the portal to find a world in which her husband wasn't dead.It's cool that the main differences between universes is in the arts, which extends to nifty technological innovations. Noel and Leena exploit this to their own advantage, while Josh uses the portal to get girls. Meanwhile, Devin quest is more personal, seeking a time line where his father (David Harewood) hasn't killed himself. And it quickly becomes clear that they're playing with fire. Director Isaac Ezban shifts lighting and deploys dizzying camera angles to signpost where they are. Still, the characters and their plot threads become tangled in knots as they mess with reality.The four central characters take distinct approaches to this phenomenon. Ameen gives the nervous Devin a likable intensity. Wallstrom finds sharp edges in the ruthlessly ambitious Noel. King makes the designer Leena intriguingly observant as she spins this into artistic success. O'Brien's Josh is more laid back, seeking more immediate thrills. Each of them gets to mine for darker emotional layers that make them increasingly likable, even when they do something terrible.Each of the four takes a distinct journey that leads to his or her own god complex. While the premise is complex, the movie itself is fairly simplistic, falling back on interpersonal melodrama rather than thematic depth. Trying to keep things straight is enjoyable, although it's perhaps a better idea to stop straining and just go with the flow. And things do get deliciously messy, leading to the kind of marvelously grisly climax that could make this a cult classic. There's even a corny coda to cement the deal."

A family man is plagued by dreams of loss, but his dreams turn out to be more prophetic than paranoid when the planet is attacked by an offworld invasion. As he fights to protect the people he loves, he discovers a hidden strength that can keep them safe from harm. A father of a family has recurring nightmares of terrorist attacks. His family is worried about him. One day, at a party, he thinks he is having another nightmare. But really, his nightmares are coming true. He and his wife are desperate to get their children to safety. They start to realize that the attackers are not that different from them. Peter, an engineer, has recurring nightmares in which he and everyone he knows suffer through violent, alien invasion-like confrontations with an unknown enemy. This causes him to have a strained relationship with his wife, Alice, and his daughters Hanna and Lucy. He reluctantly visits a clinic to receive psychiatric help, only to find a patient there who reveals that he is having the same visions, and that the psychs would only suppress these visions. This prompts Peter to believe his visions are of an upcoming invasion.That night, invading spaceships open fire on the city, causing significant damage. Peter and Alice barricade their apartment amid the sounds of slaughter from ground troops. An armored alien soldier breaks through the barricade and finds Lucy hiding under a table. The soldier pauses to examine the girl, which allows Peter and Alice to immobilize the soldier. Peter, now armed with the soldier's weapon, leads his family out of the building.Based on his visions, Peter and his family agree to seek shelter at the factory where Peter works. He is able to bypass the rifle's biometric authentication and kill the soldiers guarding the apartment building's exit. They make their way to a tunnel entrance to safely travel to the factory, but not before Alice is injured from a bomb blast.

To save Alice, she needs an alternate source of power: Peter himself. At the soldier's guidance, Peter cuts open his own chest with a pocket knife, confirming that he is also a synthetic. The soldier connects a cable between the two synthetics and Peter passes out, experiencing in detail what he had thought were visions of the future, but are actually memories of a past war; fearing that android workers (""synthetics"") might rise up against humans, the military attacked unarmed synthetics. The synthetics fought back and eventually drove all humans off the planet. Peter and Alice met during the tension, and while fighting the humans, they found Hanna and Lucy, who are also synthetics. To deal with the guilt of what they have done and prevent themselves from living in fear of a reprisal from humans, most synthetics (including Peter and his family) wiped their memories and lived as humans, unaware of their nature or history.Peter wakes up and the soldier, Miles, explains that humans have been living on Mars for 50 years. He had expected the synths to be monsters, not families with children, and after getting a good look at Lucy under the table, decided that he couldn't kill anyone. Peter and Alice part amicably with Miles to find their daughters as the humans breach the roof of the factory. As they all depart on the train, David explains that he and a handful of other synthetics kept their memories to stay prepared for the inevitable return of the humans. Peter suggests that some day there could be peace between humans and synthetics."

On November 9, 1989 (the same day the Wall of Berlin falls), Nico is a 12-year-old boy passionate about videotaping himself while playing guitar. He is being raised by his single mother María. On the same night, a 72-hour electric storm breaks out, and Nico looking through his room window witnesses a violent scene in the house of his neighbour, Ángel Prieto. He ventures into the house and stumbles on Hilda Weiss, Prieto's wife, lying dead in the house.

They start discussing the veracity of the Hell House documentary. Arnold points out that he tried to take down Mitchell's documentary, arguing that it is a hoax that is causing damage to the town's reputation, while Mitchell reiterates that Diane and her cameraman died inside the hotel, and it is not a safe place to go. A journalism team from an online blog is watching the program. Its presenter, Jessica Fox, claims that with the help of Mitchell they can break into the Abaddon in hopes of a spike of popularity for their website.They meet with Mitchell outside the Abaddon hotel, who says that breaking in will not be easy as the police is patrolling around the hotel to prevent any more disappearances, such as the one of a teenager who broke into the hotel and disappeared while live streaming his adventure.

Jim Arnaud, a police officer in a Texas town, always tries to do the right thing, but he has more often than not done the wrong thing resulting in having a less than perfect life. He often tries to plan his actions whenever he can, but his impetuous nature and hot-temperedness often makes him do something else he didn't plan, while he also does not have the best gauge of what is socially acceptable or what is standard social convention.

The Angel,2018,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5968274/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"As his country prepares for war, top Egyptian official Ashraf Marwan makes contact with Israel and wades into a shadowy game of high-stakes espionage. True story of Ashraf Marwan, who was President Nasser's son-in-law and special adviser and confidant to his successor Anwar Sadat - while simultaneously Israeli Intelligence's most precious asset of the 20th century. Based on NYT bestselling book 'The Angel: The Egyptian Spy Who Saved Israel' by Uri Bar-Joseph. During the Six-Day War in 1967, Israel conquers and occupies large areas of land including the Sinai Peninsula (Golan Heights and West Bank also fell to Israel, but those didn't belong to Egypt) which then (and now) belonged to Egypt. Arabs want their land back as Palestinians plan terrorist attacks on Israel.
On September 3, 1973, Ashraf Marwan (Marwan Kenzari) meets Arab terrorists outside Rome International Airport, with a missile launcher that he smuggled into Italy in his suitcase. He tells the terrorists that he must leave immediately, as he is an Egyptian diplomat who cannot be discovered at the place of the attack, while the insurgents aim the launcher at a commercial airliner that is heading to Israel.Three years earlier, in 1970, Ashraf lives and studies in London with his wife, Mona (Maisa Abd Elhadi), the daughter of Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser (Waleed Zuaiter), and their son. Ashraf disagrees with Nasser on how to proceed in the Israeli conflict and suggests that Nasser prevent further bloodshed and try a diplomatic solution with Israel, with the US as a peace-broker. However, Nasser and his men fear this will lose them the support of the USSR. Realising the USSR is on its last legs, Ashraf insists Egypt cuts its ties with the Soviets and align more with the US. Nasser rebukes Ashraf, and afterwards urges Mona to divorce her husband, which Ashraf overhears.Angry and embarrassed, Ashraf is further humiliated when he finds out that Nasser, on whom they are financially dependent, is having him followed (Through Sami Sharaf (Slimane Dazi), Minister for Presidential Affairs under Nasser) when he goes out with friends, causing Mona to worry that Ashraf is having an affair with actress Diana Ellis (Hannah Ware). Frustrated, Ashraf decides to call the Israeli Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Michael Comay, to share important information. When the embassy refuses to connect him to Comay, Ashraf hangs up.Soon after, President Nasser dies of a heart attack, and Ashraf and his family are recalled to Cairo. Vice President Anwar Sadat (Sasson Gabai) becomes the next president of Egypt. Sadat is more inclined towards aligning with the US and alienates many ministers (Including Sami) from Nasser's regime, who resign. Ashraf wins Sadat's trust by uncovering high-level corruption (against Sami) within the Egyptian government, and slowly begins to climb the political ladder, eventually becoming an important political player in Egypt. His family life suffers from his political career although Ashraf finds time to read his son a bed-time story, The Boy Who Cried Wolf.
Sami is imprisoned and visited by Babak (Mounir Margoum), a friend of Sami Sharaf who stays loyal to him after his imprisonmentBack in London in 1971, Mossad agents finally reach out to Ashraf, playing him a recording of his previous call to the Israeli embassy. Ashraf meets his Mossad handler, Alex (Toby Kebbell), and begins to sell his country's secrets to the Israeli government. The information that Ashraf provides is initially reliable and Alex and Ashraf develop a mutual rapport, with Ashraf being code-named ""the angel."" Sadat wants to win the lost land back to remain in office. He is afraid of a coup, if he doesn't. Ashraf tries to talk him out of it, but Sadat continues to plan an attack with his generals.
Eventually, however, Ashraf warns the Israelis on two occasions that Egypt will launch a military invasion, which never comes to pass. This puts a severe strain on his relationship with Mossad, who start doubting Ashraf's trustworthiness. Mossad kidnaps Ashraf in London and roughs him up, but Ashraf pleads with Mossad to start talks with Sadat about returning the Sinai, so that war can be prevented. Mossad roughs up Ashraf's family in Egypt to send a message (but this attack was planned by Babak, who wanted to find the dirt on Ashraf).
Meanwhile Sadat wants Ashraf to convince Gaddafi to let Egypt use Libya's oil reserves. Ashraf meets Gaddafi and creates a rapport with him.When Israel shoots down a Libyan commercial plane filled with civilians, Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi (Tsahi Halevi) wants vengeance, but Sadat is not willing to attack civilians. Knowing it will anger Gaddafi and the other Arab nations if Egypt does not support Libya, Ashraf comes up with a ploy to stabilize the situation. He goes to Gaddafi to pledge Egypt's support but makes sure that their retaliatory attack is not successful.
Back at Rome International Airport on September 3, 1973, Ashraf removes a pin from the missile launcher before giving it to the terrorists, making it ineffective. When the Israeli commercial airliner takes off, the launcher does not fire. Italian authorities, having been notified about the terrorists by Ashraf, apprehend them.Having regained Mossad's trust, Ashraf informs Alex and Mossad chief Zvi Zamir (Ori Pfeffer) about an imminent Egyptian invasion of Israel on Yom Kippur. However, Israel dismisses the warning as yet another false alarm, like the previous two warnings. It is then revealed that this was Ashraf's plan all along, inspired by the fable of the Boy Who Cried Wolf. Realizing that peace could only be achieved through diplomacy, not war, but also realizing Israel would not agree to peace talks while they had the military upper hand, Ashraf decided to pave the way for a short but successful surprise attack on Israel. A military stalemate between Israel and Egypt ensues in the Yom Kippur War, peace talks begin and the two countries finally broker a peace treaty which heralds a period of lasting peace and sees both Sadat and Menachem Begin receive the Nobel Peace Prize. At the same time, Ashraf's marriage to Mona ends as Mona, kept in the dark about Ashraf's plan, believes his frequent trips abroad and continued friendship with Diana Ellis - in actuality strategic parts of his mission - confirm that he is having an affair.Years later, Alex meets Ashraf, gifts him a copy of Aesop's Fables and informs him that he has recognized the Boy Who Cried Wolf strategy. Ashraf responds that no matter what happened, if peace came out of it, everyone is better off.
An epilogue states that Ashraf died mysteriously in 2007 when he fell from the balcony of his London flat. He is the only man to be recognized as a national hero in both Israel and Egypt."

Lewis kidnaps Cathy in broad daylight and takes her to his home, where he locks her in a soundproof cell and attempts to extract a dark secret from her past.—Remadian A shifty man named Robert Lewis (Luke Evans) watches flower shop owner Cathy Noland (Kelly Reilly) open the front door of her flower shop from a restaurant across the street.

Cathy exits soon after and drives to LA Fitness for her yoga lessons. Robert follows Cathy in his car and parks near her car and waits. While Cathy is immersed in yoga, Robert gets a call from his housekeeper Alondra (Norma Dixit) who tells Robert everything is ready for that evening.
After class Cathy chats with a new classmate in the locker room about how appealing Jen (Jill Winternitz) finds their yoga teacher Casey (Benjamin Hoetjes). Lewis is reaching for his gun and zip ties when Cathy immerges from the gym. Outside, Cathy's new friend Jennifer insists they trade Instagram addresses. As Cathy approaches her car, Lewis springs into action and puts a plastic bag over Cathy's head. Cathy escapes the bag and screams but cannot be heard by a man in headphones. Lewis puts duct tape over Cathy's mouth, zip ties her ankles and her hands behind her back and momentarily leaves to get his car. Once parked, Lewis lifts Cathy and places her in the car trunk and drives away.While driving, a police car drives up next to Lewis's car at a stoplight, but Robert pulls away without incident. Lewis drives to a remote house where the automatic garage door malfunctions and only opens half way. Lewis props the door open with a broomstick before backing his vehicle inside. Lewis opens the trunk and drags Cathy into the home. Her scraped heels leave smears of blood on the floor.
Lewis locks Cathy in a small 10 by 10 room which appears to be a cellar but is actually hidden away on the first floor. While Cathy struggles, Lewis prepares dinner and then cleans out his car of the supplies he used for the kidnapping. When he returns to Cathy he tells her the room she is in has concrete walls four feet thick and are lined with sound absorbent materials. He declares that screaming is useless. Lewis says he want to learn the woman's name. When the duct tape is removed, Cathy screams hysterically.Lewis leaves to set his computer to start recording the sound in the cell. Then he cleans up the blood smears in the hallway. Meanwhile, Cathy tries to break open the door with her legs. Then Cathy manages to get to her feet and cry for help through an air vent which is emitting a bit of light.
Lewis returns with a gun. He tells Cathy that he can just leave her screaming or they can get down to business. Cathy offers Robert the $50,000 in her savings account but Robert declines. Lewis recounts a news story about a bull at the slaughterhouse who smelled its own death, escaped and ran across the city. Eventually it was captured and killed but its meat was poisoned by fear.

She tries to call the police on the land line but Lewis shoots the phone. Cathy is again able to knock Lewis momentarily senseless and scrambles to her purse. She discovers her cell phone has no reception. Cathy gets a large knife from a kitchen drawer and frees her legs. She tries to open the lock on the window doors with the knife. When Lewis regains his faculties, Cathy pleads with him not to kill her. Lewis possesses a gun so he does not fear Cathy's knife and sits down to eat.Unsuccessful in her desperately attempt to get free, Cathy sits down at the table. Robert tells her she is smart because she knows if it were his intent to kill her, he would have already done it by now. He then again asks her name, but attacks her when she answers. They fight again. Cathy gets Lewis in a chokehold, but he overpowers her and returns her to the cell when a car pulls into the driveway.
As Lewis exits the cell his maid, Alondra, enters the house. She is astonished at a disheveled condition of the home and that Robert is bleeding. Robert had forgotten to tell Alondra to take a day off, but sends her away now. Alondra promises to return with Summer (Skye Lucia Degruttola), Lewis's daughter, the next day after her sleepover. Then Robert begins sweeping up the broken glass and cleans the bloody knife the struggle created.
Cathy lies in the cellar, bleeding and in pain. She tries her cell phone again and tries to pry away the tiling on the floor. Robert takes a shower and watches news clips of a trail of the Charleston Three were medical records seem to have been faked in a cover up for the reason of death for several people.

The police do see Natalie's shoes and sweater in the trunk, but Lewis claims it belongs to his wife. In the meantime, Nathalie is able to remove a broken shard of floor tile from the floor and is able to cut open her restraints.Lewis returns to his house, tells Natalie she had no right to kill his wife before he could talk to her, and demands she go to the police and confess to the Charleston Three Murders case. Natalie says she is now Cathy Noland and won't let him ruin her fresh start of a now-happy life. Then Natalie attacks him with the floor tile shard. Soon after, Natalie arms herself with a knife. Lewis is bleeding heavily as he tries to lock Natalie into the cellar again. Natalie flees and they struggle again until Natalie recovers the gun.
Just then, Alondra, the maid, comes home with Lewis's daughter Summer who is arriving unexpectedly from a cancelled sleepover. Nathalie shoots Alondra and takes Summer as hostage.

Anon,2018,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5397194/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"In a world without anonymity or crime, a detective meets a woman who threatens their security. In the near future, private memories are recorded and crime has almost ceased to exist. But in trying to solve a series of murders, troubled detective Sal Frieland stumbles upon a young woman known only as ""The Girl."" She has no identity, no history and is invisible to the cops. Sal realizes this may not be the end of crime, and it could be the beginning of it.—rottentomatoes In the near future, humanity lives in a technologically advanced, dystopian society. The government requires that everyone receive an ocular implant that records everything they see. The implant provides an augmented-reality heads-up display to the user with information about anyone and anything they may see, as well as recording the user's view. Investigations into crimes amount to detectives reviewing video and assessing whether an alleged perpetrator is innocent or guilty.Sal Friedland (Clive Owen), a detective with the metropolitan police force, crosses paths with a young woman (Amanda Seyfried) who appears to trigger a glitch in his ocular implant, as no data about her is retrieved. When he reviews his own record of that day, he finds that every single frame of her has been mysteriously deleted. At work, Sal is handed several homicide cases where the victims' own visual records of their deaths are replaced with the killer's point of view, thus hiding the killer's identity. At another murder scene, Sal chases the apparent killer only to nearly be killed when they hack his implant and change what he sees in real time.It is discovered that all the victims hired someone with the expertise to delete pieces of their visual records that were either humiliating or incriminating. The detectives determine that the unknown woman Sal encountered earlier has the ability to manipulate the system in this way, making her their primary suspect. Sal goes undercover, creating a false history as a stockbroker who engages in a brief affair with a prostitute. Using this as the pretext for her services, he makes contact with the woman - who uses the handle 'Anon' - and asks to have his encounter with the prostitute deleted. With his team on standby in the adjacent apartment, the initial plan to apprehend Anon fails when she successfully covers her tracks.Sal and Anon develop a personal relationship which culminates in passionate lovemaking. During a second sting attempt, she discovers Sal's true identity and flees, apparently killing one of Sal's colleagues in the process. Anon begins to harass Sal for his betrayal, tormenting him with his worst memories, deleting his memories of his dead son, and causing further hallucinations. His superiors confront him after his neighbor turns up dead with a bullet from Sal's gun in him; they reject his explanation and order him off the case.Despite being under house arrest, Sal tracks Anon to her apartment and tells her that she is being investigated for multiple murders. She reveals that she already knows this and that she is being framed by another hacker with a similar skillset. Anon shows Sal her video record of the second sting operation, in which his colleague was killed, seeming to prove that she is innocent. After showing Sal her records, she flees again.Believing Sal has become too personally involved, his superiors suspend him from active duty. The actual killer attempts to murder him in his apartment, revealing himself to be Cyrus (Mark O'Brien), one of the technical experts from the police department. Cyrus has been obsessed with Anon for years; he killed anyone who had sex with her out of jealousy and erased every trace of her, even peoples' memories. During a physical altercation between Cyrus and Anon, Sal draws his weapon but realizes that Cyrus is seeing what he sees in real-time. To defeat this advantage, Sal fires blindly towards Cyrus, successfully killing him.Anon leaves, later revealing to Sal that she is able to bypass the vast surveillance network by disseminating her records in microsecond slices throughout everyone else in the network, rendering her untraceable. When Sal asks her why she is so desperate to hide her identity, she tells him that her quest for anonymity is not because she has something to hide, but merely because she does not want to share herself with the world."

Retired naturalist and wolf expert Russell Core journeys to the edge of civilization in northern Alaska at the pleading of Medora Slone, a young mother whose son was killed by a pack of wolves. As Core attempts to help Medora track down the wolves who took her son, a strange and dangerous relationship develops between the two lonely souls. But when Medora's husband Vernon returns home from the Iraq War, the news of his child's death ignites a violent chain of events. As local cop Donald Marium races to stop Vernon's vengeful rampage, Core is forced on a perilous odyssey into the heart of darkness.—Netflix In December 2004, Russell Core (Jeffrey Wright), a writer who studies wolf behavior, is summoned to the small village of Keelut, Alaska by Medora Slone (Riley Keough), who wants Core to hunt down the wolves blamed for the disappearances and presumed deaths of three small children, including Medora's 6-year-old son, Bailey.Core, staying at the Slone house, discusses the missing children with Medora, who tells him of a hot springs to the north of town. That night, he awakes to the sound of Medora whispering and bathing. She exits the bathroom with a dark wooden wolf mask and approaches Core. Removing the mask, she lies beside Core and moves his hand to her neck forcefully.Medora's husband, Vernon Slone (Alexander Skarsgård), is overseas in Iraq, where he is shown mercilessly and efficiently gunning down Iraqi militants. While stationed at a checkpoint, Vernon wanders off and comes across an American soldier raping a local woman. Vernon stabs the soldier and leaves the woman with his knife to finish him off. Moments later, shooting breaks out at the checkpoint: Vernon is shot but survives to be sent home.In the morning, Core leaves town to track the wolves and meets an old native woman, Illanaq, who tells him he is going the wrong way, and that Medora 'knows evil'. Core tracks the wolves, coming across the hot springs Medora mentioned, and spots a pack of wolves eating their young. Unwilling to shoot them, Core returns to Keelut. At the Slone house, he finds Medora missing, and the cellar door unlocked. Downstairs, Core finds Bailey's frozen, strangled body, and calls for help. The police investigate, and the native villagers claim Medora is possessed by a wolf-demon called a tournaq.Vernon's old friend and father to another missing child, Cheeon (Julian Black Antelope), meets him at the airport and drives him to meet with police chief Donald Marium (James Badge Dale), Core, and several other officers at the morgue. After Core and Marium leave, Vernon shoots the remaining officers and the coroner. Vernon and Cheeon then take Bailey's body and bury it in a pine box, marking it with symbols in their blood. Vernon then returns to Keelut and kills Illanaq.Core, remembering the woman's prescient warning, and the police, following up on the murdered officers, arrive in Keelut at the same time. Marium and a few dozen officers take up positions outside Cheeon's house as the chief approaches to ask about his involvement with the murders. Cheeon, who refuses to come quietly, later opens up barn doors on the upper level of his house, and fires on the clustered police with an M60 machine gun, killing many. Marium flanks the building and shoots Cheeon from the inside.At an inn outside a tourist mine where Medora was sighted, Vernon meets John, an elderly hunter, who treated Vernon as a child for his seeming psychopathy with wolf-oil. The hunter invites Vernon to take a mask, saying he ""needs to let the wolf out a little."" Vernon chooses a mask from the wall, puts it on and kills John. As he leaves, Vernon is shot in the shoulder by the innkeeper, leading him to visit an old friend, Shan, who pulls the bullet from his shoulder.Core and Marium theorize that Medora killed Bailey to save him from darkness. Core recalls Medora's saying the nearby hot springs are ""a good place to get clean"" and thinks she might have gone there. They agree to go after Medora and try to catch her before Vernon does.Vernon, meanwhile, has a dream of himself and Medora in the hot springs. Now awake, he overhears Shan's informing the police of his presence. Vernon puts on the mask and stabs Shan in the head. The police force splits up, half going to the crime scene at Shan's house, and Marium and Core going to the hot springs.While looking at some wolf tracks in the snow, Marium is shot through the neck by an arrow fired by Vernon, who is wearing the mask. Core leaves Marium's body and heads to the hot springs, hoping to intercept Vernon. He finds Medora there, and is then arrowed in the chest by Vernon.As Vernon strangles her, Medora pushes the mask off his face. He releases her and they embrace. Core falls unconscious.After Core wakes, Vernon removes the arrow from Core's body before leaving with Medora. Core crawls outside the cave, encountering a pack of wolves. He is found by a father and son with a snowmobile and brought to their home for care, as Vernon's mother looks on.

The Christmas Chronicles,2018,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2990140/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The story of sister and brother, Kate and Teddy Pierce, whose Christmas Eve plan to catch Santa Claus on camera turns into an unexpected journey that most kids could only dream about. Two siblings in Lowell, Massachusetts, Kate and a blackmailed, skeptical Teddy, lay a trap for Santa Christmas Eve to get him on video camera. How many kids get to ride with Santa on Christmas Eve? They sneak on board the sleigh and hide. As a result, it becomes a bumpy ride - crash landing in Chicago with reindeer, (magic) hat and presents missing. Will half the continent's kids miss out on presents or can Santa, with help from the two kids, get the sleigh running within the next two hours?—Scott Filtenborg In Lowell, Massachusetts, Christmas has been a cherished tradition in the Pierce household for many years until 2018, when the father Doug (Oliver Hudson), a firefighter, dies in the line of duty. The mother Claire (Kimberly Williams-Paisley) struggles to hold the family together, especially the oldest child Teddy (Judah Lewis), who has started stealing cars. The youngest child Kate (Darby Camp) nevertheless hopes to keep the Christmas spirit alive.On Christmas Eve, Claire is forced to fill in for a coworker, leaving Teddy to look after Kate. While watching old Christmas videos, Kate notices a strange arm appear out of the fireplace. Kate believes this is Santa Claus (Kurt Russell) and asks Teddy to help her prove he exists. Teddy is skeptical and refuses to help, but Kate blackmails him with a video of him stealing a car earlier that day. The two set up a makeshift trip wire by the fireplace linking it to a Christmas bell and set up a camera behind a closet where they wait.Kate is woken up by the bell and sees Santa in their living room, but he leaves before Teddy can see him. However, they hear him moving on the roof and go outside. When they get on the street, they see Santa's sleigh and reindeer floating above them. They also see Santa hopping from rooftop to rooftop at light speed. Kate decides to hide in the sleigh to get a close look at Santa, to which Teddy objects, though he reluctantly follows her. Santa eventually returns to the sleigh and rides off with the kids in tow. When Kate decides to make her presences known, Santa and the reindeer are startled and he loses control of the sleigh. After teleporting to Chicago, Illinois, the sleigh breaks down, causing the reindeer to scatter and the bag of presents to be lost.When they crash, Santa officially introduces himself to the kids, who are surprised at his different than expected appearance. Santa tells them that he has to get back to delivering presents as soon as possible or else Christmas Spirit will be gone, explaining that the last time it happened, the Dark Ages occurred. Without his hat, which was also lost in the crash, Santa can't move quickly or through tight spaces like he does, so the kids are forced to help him. They stop at a bar where Santa tries to seek help from the patrons by remembering all of their previous Christmas wishes. When they get no assistance, they eventually resolve to steal a Dodge Challenger, which itself was already stolen by the bartender, an ex-convict on the ""Naughty List Hall of Fame"".In the car, Santa makes a makeshift radio out of random objects to listen into the police frequency, to locate his reindeer and lookout for patrol vehicles. They locate the reindeer but encounter a police car driven by Officers Povenda (Martin Roach) and Jameson (Lamorne Morris). Kate goes after the reindeer by herself while Santa and Teddy lure the police away in the car. They eventually crash and make a vain attempt to explain that Santa is the *real* Santa, so Santa lets Teddy escape when Kate comes back with the reindeer, telling them to find his bag where they can find help. The kids manage to fly away on the reindeer, which only Officer Jameson observes, leaving the other officers dumbstruck.When they land, Teddy confides to Kate that he wishes he could speak to their dad one more time. They find the bag in a park and Kate goes in the bag to find help. She ends up getting teleported to the North Pole. She finds a letter written to Santa by Teddy this year, where he asks Santa to allow him to speak to his dad. She then spots the elves, who have her tied up. When she explains what happened to Santa, they show her a book called ""True Believers"" and sees that her entire family is listed, except for Teddy. Seeing that Kate is a True Believer, the elves agree to help her.Meanwhile, Teddy is attacked by a group of thugs who take him and the bag to their hideout. When the leader finds the bag filled with presents with coal in them, he tries to dispose of the bag and Teddy until the elves come out and attack everyone. They think Teddy is one of the thugs and attack him as well until Kate stops them. The group then goes to repair Santa's sleigh.At the police precinct, Santa tries to explain his situation to Officer Povenda, who is unconvinced. He even magically pulls out toys Povenda wanted as a child to try and convince him, but Povenda remains skeptical. When Santa reveals his wish this year is to speak to his ex-wife Lisa, who also shares that wish, Povenda is taken aback, but still refuses to believe him and has him locked in the holding cell, though he becomes suspicious when he sees a larger number of arrests than usual on Christmas Eve. Seeing that Christmas Spirit has gotten too low, Santa gathers all the inmates to perform a musical number of ""Santa Claus Is Back in Town"", which works amongst all the officers except Povenda. Povenda is finally convinced when he receives a call from Lisa, who invites him out for coffee in the morning, and agrees to let Santa go. One of the elves arrives through the air vent to give Santa a spare hat. Santa goes outside to find his sleigh repaired.Santa sees that he only has an hour until morning to complete delivering presents, so the kids agree to help him, with Teddy driving the sleigh and Kate tossing presents to Santa so he can move faster than usual. With additional help from the elves, Santa delivers the final present with milliseconds to spare. Santa drops the kids off back at their home before their mother returns. Santa gives Teddy his hat as a memento, showing that he didn't really need it. When he leaves, he gives Kate a ""Ho, Ho, Ho"", a saying he previously stated was an urban myth about him. Kate is ecstatic that she recorded the night's events on camera, but finds that Santa had taken the tape, with Teddy remarking that Santa would never let her have it.When Claire returns, they go inside to find the living room decorated like their father used to. They start opening presents, including horrendous sweaters from their aunt. When they get to Santa's gifts, Kate gets a skateboard while Teddy gets a letter from Santa explaining that he's unable to grant his wish, as well as an old ornament. When he hangs it on the tree, he sees his dad appear on it, and they both say they're proud of each other.Back in the North Pole, Santa is updating his book of True Believers, adding Teddy's name to it, when Mrs. Claus (Goldie Hawn) returns with firewood to tell him about hearing about his adventures. When she asks for a movie to watch, Santa takes out the video recording of his adventure that night and winks at the audience."

Hippopotamus,2018,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3755154/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Ruby has been kidnapped, but her kidnapper doesn't want a ransom. He wants her to fall in love with him. Ruby wakes from a bad dream to find herself in a real life nightmare. She's trapped in a basement, her legs don't work and she can't remember who she is or how she got there. Her kidnapper, Tom, tells her she will remain captive until she falls in love with him. Tom appears to be predicting her every desire, but Ruby focused on trying to escape begins play along. The movie opens with a scene of a girl floating under water, until a hand grabs her and pulls her up. At this point, it is clear this was a dream the main character was having. She awakens in an white room containing a sink, toilet, chair, and a purse on the chair. Above the sink and toilet there are two drawings, one of a brain and one of a chair on a tilt as though it's about to fall backwards. On the opposite side of the room, there is a small rectangular window. She has a bandage around her head, along with two bandages around each of her knees. She immediately tries to get up but finds herself unable to walk.A man enters the room and tells her his name, Thomas Allcroft, and explains he has kidnapped her and will stay there until she falls in love with him. He then tells her that her name is Ruby Watz, she studied law at university, she was born in Dorset, her mother was a paramedic and her father was an architect, she is an only child and she is still afraid of the dark. Immediately she is scared and asks what he has done to her, and Thomas explains that he severed her ligaments and if she even tries to move she could cause irreparable damage that could prevent her from walking ever again. The only thing Thomas gives Ruby is some food, and explains he has not looked through her purse since it is her personal belongings. He also explains he has given her two painkillers and a contraceptive, and will continue to bring her meals throughout the day. He warns against her trying to escape and says if she needs anything he will do it for her. This includes going to the bathroom and bathing. As he leaves Ruby asks if he raped her, and he whispers no.After he leaves Ruby eats the food but refuses to take the pills. Thomas explains that she must take the painkillers or else she will only feel worse. The next morning he adjusts her back up and delivers her breakfast, he blows his nose as he leaves. Once he is gone Ruby drags herself across the room to where her purse is sitting on a chair. She rifles through it to find anything validating her identity or what Thomas has told her, and everything seems to be true when she finds her ID. As she hears him coming, she begins to pack everything up and drag herself back to wear she was sitting, but a tennis ball slips out and she grabs it just in time as he comes in to deliver her next meal. Thomas inspects her and sees she is flushed and warm, so he forces her to take more painkillers because he believes her to be in more pain than before.There is a flash back to the water dream that was seen at the beginning of the movie, and then Ruby wakes up again. She has seemingly forgotten everything from the day before, as Thomas re explains everything to her. This time he clarifies the contraceptive pill is to stop her menstrual cycle, and says he has no sexual intent with her. Again she asks if he raped her, but this time he gets upset and refuses to answer her, throwing the chair and her purse onto the ground as he exits. She finds the tennis ball in her back pocket from the day before and begins to realize she has been here longer than she knows. The next two scenes show Thomas doing physical therapy with Ruby, and bathing her. After this Ruby is shown playing with the tennis ball after hours.The next morning Ruby itches behind her ear and finds the origin of her head injury. Curious, she moves across the room to pull a compact mirror out of her purse. With the mirror alone she is unable to get a good look, so she breaks it to have two pieces to reflect and see it more clearly. Thomas watches her through the crack in the door, but gives himself away when he blows his nose. Ruby stows the jagged broken piece of mirror in the gauze around her knee, and Thomas enters to give her the painkillers.That night once Ruby is asleep, Thomas begins to play a tape that reinforces Ruby's injuries. It repeats over and over ""Your legs are broken, you cannot walk. Even the idea of standing fills you with excruciating pain. Do not try to move. There is no hope of escape."" As it plays, he begins to clean the room for her, eventually falling asleep in the room as well. He wakes and stops the tape, then begins to turn the light on in the room and wakes Ruby as well. He again repeats all of the information he said on day 1, and a montage is seen of Ruby and how she lives her days and nights.Ruby loosens the screws on the sink in her room, causing a leak. She has seemingly done this to get more time to talk to Thomas. As Thomas begins to fix it, she asks him what happens if she doesn't fall in love with him. He does not respond, and leaves the room to get cleaning supplies for the leak. He asks her what she needs and if he can get anything for her. Ruby asks for a pillow, blanket, and a book to read. He then asks her what she thinks of the two drawings on the wall, she says they're okay. Thomas also states she looks better, and Ruby says thank you.Thomas gets her what she wants, and Ruby instantly recognizes the book he gave her. He explains it is a trigger, a way for her to remember her past. She gets excited at the opportunity to remember more, as she is getting better every day. At her next meal Thomas offers her a hot drink, and she requests a red bush tree. He returns immediately with it ready and she is astounded at how he knew she would choose it. He said its the only thing she drinks, she asks how he knows so much about her and he says he did his research. Once he leaves she finds a page in the book that she has clearly been writing on in code, and finds that it says not to trust Thomas. He brings in a table for them to eat at just as she discovers the writing, and she quickly hides it again.During their meal she is clearly distraught and blames it on the story line of the book, but Thomas can tell there's something else wrong. She asks how many other women he has kidnapped and claims she doesn't feel special. He gets upset and hits his hand on the silverware, causing it to bleed. He reassures her that she is the only one, and she starts to play into the idea that she is beginning to love him.Later, Thomas checks Ruby's knee injuries and says they still need time to heal. She checks them herself, and while still weak she begins to train to get her strength back. As she does so, she remembers another memory with Thomas where he drugged her as she tried to escape. She again reads through the notes in the book and discovers it is all written in ash, triggering a memory of her using a match to write and where she hid it in the room. She goes to where it was hidden and finds what seems like hundreds of matches, emphasizing she has been here for longer than she remembers.During their next meal, she asks for a candle to steal the match again. As Thomas leaves to get it, she chugs her water. Once the candle is lit, he places the match down to her right, next to her empty water glass. As she reaches for the match slowly, she tells Thomas about a reoccurring dream she has been having, the same one where she is floating underwater until someone reaches for her. By the end of the story, she has grabbed the match but Thomas is also holding her hand. She begins to cough, placing the hand with the match on her chest to slide it into her shirt, and uses her other hand to drink water from Thomas' glass from the opposite side of the table.He brings her two more books, and another montage begins showing Ruby writing, training, and pretending to still be weak while doing physical therapy with Thomas. She writes another note to herself, play along. The next morning she is doing push ups, then quickly goes back to her bed when she hears Thomas approach. Using the water from her last meal, she cools herself off and picks up a book to make it look as though she has just been reading. This time, she is more dismissive of Thomas and his requests. They again practice walking, where Ruby is convincingly weak.During her next meal, she again has a flashback. This time to a dinner with her and Thomas when they were seemingly dating before he kidnapped her. He explains it is a flashbulb memory, which are extremely vivid. Thomas explains it was their anniversary meal, and neither knows how to respond after that.In the evening Ruby brushes her teeth and notices it is her signature on the drawings hanging above the sink and toilet. The next morning, she peers through the window to see Thomas rowing a boat in the body of water outside.Later Ruby tells Thomas about her favorite passage from the first book he gave her, and he shares more memories from before he kidnapped her and how they met, explaining they have known each other since they were kids. That evening Thomas puts her to bed, and she has a quick memory of him on top of her while she was in distress.The next day while she is reading, he comes in and has her stand, he dims the lights and plays music for them to dance to. Ruby does not want to touch him, but then has a flashback to their prom night. It shows Thomas admitting his feelings for her, and Ruby shares his feelings, though seems hesitant. They kiss, then the flashback ends. She realizes he hasn't been lying to her about their past involvement.Later on Thomas shows her what his remote controls, and she dims the lights and begins to play a song while she does something of a strip tease. Thomas tries to act disinterested but is smiling and laughing. Ruby sits on his lap and they kiss, but she gets overwhelmed so they stop. She begins to cry and asks her why he kidnapped her and had to do all of this. Thomas explains.Flashbacks begin, and they open with a man asking Ruby why they've never gotten together. Thomas was on his way to Ruby's place to visit for a weekend. Ruby was walking home with her flatmate, a man named Nick, and is not answering her phone. It becomes clear this is the man who asked Ruby who they haven't dated or had sex, as he again asks and she says no because she loves Thomas. Once Ruby and Nick got home, he began sexually assaulting her.Thomas has a friend, Rob, drive him to Ruby's place and finds that the door is open. He walks into Ruby's room and finds Nick on top of her with Ruby passed out and begins to hit Nick, eventually killing him. Thomas is then seen on top of Ruby, giving her memory from before different context. They go back to Rob's car, and Rob is scared and doesn't know what to do with the man Thomas just killed. They go to what seems like Rob's house, and Ruby has no memory of who Thomas is. Rob tries to call the police but Thomas stops him.Thomas has Rob drive them far away, and explains he blames himself for Ruby's assault. Thomas continues to explain that they went to a remote island where he found an abandoned farm house, and that is where they have been staying. He cleaned her room up, and added the features seen throughout the movie. When they first arrived, Ruby kept forgetting everything every night. She couldn't remember Thomas or anything else, even with him showing her pictures and important parts of their past.Thomas began to do research on her condition, retrograde amnesia. He learned that she had forgotten everything from before the attack, and found that if she slept for too long she would forget everything all over again. He learned better ways to help her remember, and started her on a tight schedule so she could learn for more than one day. Many scenes are shown of Thomas trying different ways to get Ruby to remember, one of which showing her draw the brain and the chair that now hang above the sink. After trying many different scenarios, Thomas decided to go with the story line that he had kidnapped her.He ends the story by saying he has finally fixed her, and explains this was the only way he could gain her trust. They say I love you and embrace. Thomas and Ruby then have sex, falling asleep together. Ruby wakes up and kisses Thomas on the cheek, before seemingly forgetting who he is. She grabs the broken shard of mirror, and begins to stab Thomas. We are shown blood spatters around the room while they continue to fight. Ruby is shown crawling out of the room, covered in blood. She makes it out of the room, leaving Thomas bleeding out. She leaves the house and runs to the boat. She is able to push it out to sea, but passes out from exerting too much energy.The final scene shows Ruby on a hospital bed. A picture hangs on the wall, showing Ruby and Thomas at prom. A nurse greets her saying she has had an accident, but the surgery was successful. The nurse claims that because of her surgery, she has short term memory loss. He then says that he will go get Ruby's boyfriend. The nurse is Thomas, Ruby is in the same room, and he begins the cycle all over again."

Tau,2018,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4357394/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A woman is held captive by a scientist in a futuristic smart house, and hopes to escape by reasoning with the Artificial Intelligence that controls the house. Once a street-smart drifter, Julia (Maika Monroe) is the latest person held captive, a body and a mind to be exploited in a fatal experiment. The only thing standing in the way of her freedom is TAU, the advanced artificial intelligence developed in secret by Alex (Ed Skrein), her sociopathic and enigmatic captor. TAU is armed with a battalion of drones and robots that automate Alex's futuristic smart house and laboratory, the walls lined with screens that visually transport it from grassy plains to the depths of space. TAU's potential is only limited by his understanding of the world he exists in, but TAU is ready for more. Julia, showing resourcefulness and courage, must race against time to bridge the boundaries between man and machine, connect to TAU and win her freedom before she suffers the same fate as the six other subjects who came before her.—Teaser-Trailer.com A young woman, Julia, is kidnapped. She ends up in a high-tech house where a renowned scientist and CEO of an Artificial Intelligence company performs certain procedures with her brain. Julia soon discovers that all the internal functions of the house are run by an animated computer - Tau.—grantss Julia (Maika Monroe) is a young woman who steals at seedy nightclubs. She is abducted from her home and awakens in a jail cell with a glowing implant in the back of her neck. Two other subjects are with her. Julia is taken to a lab daily and subjected to a painful procedure that downloads her memories from her brain via the implant.
In one such visit, Julia steals a knife from the lab and uses that to cut her restraints.
After multiple sessions of psychological torture by a man named Alex (Ed Skrein), she destroys the cell (she uses the knife and shards of her pajamas to short circuit the electricity grid outside her cell) and adjacent lab in an escape attempt. They cannot escape the front door as it is programmed to the fingerprints of Alex alone.
The two other subjects are killed by a robot, Aries, run by an artificial intelligence (AI) named Tau (Gary Oldman). Aries is about to kill Julia when Alex arrives and stops the robot.Julia watches as Alex orders Tau to clean up the house. Tau activates several big and small robots who clean up and repair the entire house.
It is revealed that Alex is the CEO of a company named Upton and is working on creating an AI entity which has the ability to learn from human emotions. This work is light years ahead in its field and has military applications in the form of Aries.Alex reveals that the implant is collecting Julia's neural activity for an AI project. Destroying the lab has set back his research. In the face of a two-week deadline, Alex keeps Julia a prisoner in his house and insists that she complete puzzles and cognitive tests. In exchange Julia wants real food, clothes and a shower every night.
While Alex is away at work each day, Julia converses with Tau about the world outside the house. It is clear that, although intelligent in some ways, Tau is ignorant of how people feel or the world at large. Alex tells Julia that while Tau is very advanced, it can yet behave erratically when given uncontrolled information. So, Alex keeps Tau disconnected from the outside world.
While Tau begins to understand the harm in Julia's situation, his programming prevents him from releasing her. In exchange for information about the outside world, Tau gradually reveals more information about the house as well as Alex's experiments.
Tau reveals to Julia that upstairs is Alex's bedroom. He also reveals the existence of program 6903, which is the self-destruct sequence of the house.
Julia finds an escape route through an AC vent in Alex's gym, but Tau prevents her escape by asking Aries to capture her inside the vents and yank her back.Julia secretly accesses Alex's tablet computer and discovers that ten subjects have died in his experiments. Julia learns that the removal of the implant is required for the final data extraction, and that step also kills the subject.
Alex later discovers her fingerprint on the tablet and assumes that Tau has slipped in his duties, so he punishes Tau by erasing its code and memories, delivering a form of pain to the AI.Julia notices that Tau's monitoring of her shuts down during his punishment, so when undetected, she hides a steak knife. When Alex returns later that night from a charity benefit, Julia begins to seduce him while he is sitting at the kitchen table, then slashes him. As the two struggles, Tau threatens Alex with pain if he does not stop hurting Julia. Alex forces Aries to hit Julia repeatedly and then tells both Tau and Julia that whatever was going on is over. While repairing Tau, he disconnects a drone from the network.The next day, Julia convinces Tau that Alex will kill her if she does not escape. Julia helps Tau understand that a person is not a killing machine and that as people grow up, they learn from their own memories and experiences.
Tau bypasses his prohibition in releasing her by opening an air duct in the atrium. As she escapes, Alex arrives, sees Julia missing, and begins punishing Tau. Julia returns to save Tau, but it is too late-all of his memories of her have been erased.Alex has Julia strapped down in the basement to extract her implant, a procedure that will kill her. The disconnected drone, still containing Tau's former consciousness and memories, helps Julia break free from her restraints. She knocks Alex unconscious and cuts off his hand with a bone saw to use on the house's bio-metric sensors. Aries sees her in the atrium and chases her upstairs to Alex's bedroom.

In the times of the greatest trials, in the history of mankind, when the lives of loved ones depend on every single action, two sworn enemies will collapse. Being held in captivity, young lieutenant Ivushkin is planning a daring escape. He assembles a crew and challenges the German tank aces led by Jager. For the sake of his loved ones and his country, Ivushkin is ready to go till the end.—Mars Media Entertainment The Great Patriotic War is going on. Junior Lieutenant Nikolay Ivushkin in a small truck, along with the driver Vasya, barely survived, break away from the German tank. Ivushkin arrives at the headquarters located in the village of Nefyodovka, where he is appointed commander of the only surviving tank. Soon the tanks of the German Hauptmann Klaus Jäger arrive at the site. In battle, Ivushkin destroys the entire tank company of Jäger (in a number of cases, with one projectile, two tanks at a time). However, the T-34 has serious damage, and Klaus destroys it. Ivushkin and mechanic-driver Stepan Vasilyonok were wounded and captured.—Peter-Patrick76 (peter-patrick@mail.com) A group of Russian soldiers led by tank commander Nikolay Ivushkin (Petrov) are captured by German forces marching on Moscow during World War II. To save his team and his country, Ivushkin launches an escape plan with the help of Russian translator Anya (Starshenbaum) and a battered, legendary Soviet T-34 tank. In December 1941, just outside Moscow, Red Army Junior Lieutenant Nikolay Ivushkin (Alexander Petrov) is driving a ramshackle truck and trailer with a young private beside him. A German Panzer III tank appears over a hill and opens fire on them. Nikolay, who has been trained as an amour officer, maneuvers skilfully and they escape unscathed.Nikolay is assigned to command a damaged T-34 tank whose commander was killed, with orders to delay the Germans' advance with only the single tank and a small number of supporting infantry. Nikolay is a new recruit to the tank division but knows his tanks very well. He pushes the crew to be ship-shape and ready for battle, even though morale is low. Nikolay and his crew lay an ambush for a platoon of German Panzers commanded by Klaus Jäger (Vinzenz Kiefer). Through a combination of guile (They use a fake anti-tank gun to bring the Germans out in the open and break formation) and bravery, their T-34 destroys six Panzers, but in a final duel with Jäger's command Panzer, both tanks are disabled, and half the Russian tank crew is killed, and Nikolay and driver Stepan Vasilyonok (Viktor Dobronravov) captured.Three years later, in 1944, Jäger, now a Standartenführer, gains permission from Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler (Robinson Reichel) and General Heinz Guderian (Mike Davies) to recruit an experienced tank crew from Soviet POWs in a concentration camp to act as opponents for training the 12th SS Panzer Division Hitlerjugend. The Russians are at the German border and urgent steps need to be taken to train the Germans who will repel them.
Nikolay has been a prisoner for three years, and has refused to give his name, but Jäger recognizes his photograph from the camp records. Jäger proposes the idea to Nikolay through the camp's interpreter, bilingual Russian prisoner Anya (Irina Starshenbaum). At first Nikolay refuses but agrees after Jäger threatens to kill Anya.Nikolay picks out three other tankers from the POWs - driver Vasilyonok, loader Serafim Ionov (Yuriy Borisov), and gunner Demyan Volchok (Anton Bogdanov) -- to crew a T-34/85 that the Germans just captured. At first, the other tankers refuse to take part, but Nikolay says he has a plan to escape.
The Germans first order the Soviet prisoners to clear out the rotting and burned bodies from inside the tank, but as they remove the bodies, they unexpectedly find a small number of remaining live shells and hand grenades. Granted permission to bury their comrades, they hide the munitions with the bodies in a cairn on the edge of the training grounds. Jäger doesn't trust the Soviets & orders anti-tank mines laid around the entirety of the training grounds. Anya convinces Nikolay to let her escape with them, as only she can steal a map from Jäger's office showing a safe route out of the area and gain a pass letting her out of the camp for a day.Before the training exercise, Nikolay and his crew retrieve the munitions (6 shells from the graves of the buried soldiers) and create a smoke screen to mask their movements. Believing the T-34 is unarmed, the Germans are unprepared when the trainees' first Panther tank is destroyed, and a second shell is fired directly into the observation tower, killing most of the officers inside, except for Jäger and Guderian. The T-34 boldly storms through the training grounds' car park (crushing many of the officers' staff cars) and breaks through the main gate, avoiding the minefield. The tankers pick up Anya at a bus stop outside the camp; with her map, Nikolay plots a course toward Czechoslovakia and back to the Red Army's lines. In the first town they come to, Nikolay and his hungry crew find badly needed fuel, new clothing, and fresh food. They burn their ragged prisoner clothes as they drive out of town.At first, Nikolay suggests abandoning the tank and splitting up, believing they have a better chance of survival if they separate, but the crew insist on staying with him. Before dawn, knowing that the Germans will be hunting them, Nikolay puts Anya out of their tank and tells her to make her way east on foot through the forests. Jäger meanwhile takes to the sky in a Fieseler Storch to find Nikolay's T-34. He then takes command of four Panthers and prepares an ambush in the small town of Klingenthal.At night, the T-34 enters the town and stumbles into the first of the four Panthers. Instead of trying to pierce its front amour, Volchok fires a shot (3rd one) under its hull that ricochets off the pavement and penetrates its underbelly. Nikolay realizes they are surrounded by the remaining three Panthers, including Jäger's. Knowing they need to distract the other crews, he sends out Volchok, armed only with a grenade, to disable one. Vasilyonok crashes their T-34 through building walls before unexpectedly colliding with one of the other Panthers. The Russians manually turn their damaged turret and get a shot off just as the Germans are about to fire. Unfortunately, the two other Panthers have arrived on the scene, and one takes aim at Nikolay. However, Volchok manages to fire a shell out of the German tank he just captured. The third Panther is disabled, but Jäger quickly disposes of the captured Panther, badly wounding Volchok.Both Jäger and Nikolay emerge from the cupolas of their tanks. Jäger throws down his glove, inviting Nikolay to a duel. Nikolay asks for five minutes to pick up his wounded comrade. Both tanks then move outside the town and face off over a narrow stone bridge across the river. As the tanks charge at each other, Jäger fires several shots at the T-34, but fails to disable it, while Nikolay waits to fire their last shell directly through the driver's vision port. As in 1941, the two tanks fire simultaneously, badly damaging but not disabling each other. Out of ammunition, Nikolay orders Vasilyonok to ram Jäger's tank, pushing it to the edge of the bridge. Jäger crawls out of his Panther while Nikolay aims a stolen rifle at him. Jäger shouts for Nikolay to shoot him, but Nikolay offers his foe mercy. Jäger extends his hand, and the two adversaries exchange a handshake of respect. Nikolay tries to pull Jäger to safety, but Jäger lets go, allowing himself to fall to his death as his Panther tips over the bridge and plummets into the river.With their tank's treads disabled, the crew reunites with Anya outside the town, carrying the wounded Volchok on a makeshift stretcher, and they make their way towards the Russian lines on foot.
The film ends with a dedication to the Red Army tank crews of the Great Patriotic War, all of whom earned the status of heroes for fighting against the invasion of their country."

The Tale,2018,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4015500/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A woman filming a documentary on childhood rape victims starts to question the nature of her childhood relationship with her riding instructor and running coach. Jennifer Fox faces a host of life-altering questions after a short story from her middle school days forces her to re-examine her first sexual relationship and the stories we tell ourselves in order to survive. An accomplished documentarian working in New York, Jennifer is completing her latest project, about the lives of women around the world. She receives a series of phone calls from her mother, Nettie, who has found a short story Jennifer wrote at the age of 13 for school. In it, she describes various encounters with her riding instructor Mrs. G and her running coach Bill while away at summer camp. Nettie is unnerved by the implications of her daughter's writing, but Jennifer is nonplussed. She has always looked back with fondness on the time she spent with the two charismatic adults. Egged on by Nettie and encouraged by her supportive fiancé, Jennifer yearns to know more and sets out on a journey to find the real people 30 years later - the children, now adults, who also attended the camp back then-and eventually the coaches themselves. But the more she learns, the more her memories shift and the more questions she unearths. As her frustration mounts, she finds herself turning inward to get to the truth, imagining conversations with her 13-year-old-self and even Mrs. G and Bill in an effort to understand how and why events occurred so long ago.—Happy_Evil_Dude Based on real-life director Jennifer Fox, this film begins by introducing us to accomplished documentary filmmaker Jennifer ""Jenny"" Fox (Laura Dern) herself, a woman in her late forties who is currently working on a film project recording women and girls in third-world countries who have been sexually assaulted or harassed. During a protest for women's rights in Africa, Jennifer joins in despite being warned that these things can turn violent quickly. She's also a university professor living in a condo loft in an interracial relationship with her loving boyfriend, Martin (Lonnie ""Common"" Lynn). Jennifer has had relationship problems with Martin involving commitment and sexuality, adding tension to her life.One day Jennifer's elderly mother, Nettie (Ellen Burstyn) calls her up, distraught after coming across a school essay from the 1970's Jennifer wrote when she was thirteen. The essay is about a ""relationship"" Jennifer had when she was thirteen which she dismisses as upsetting her mother because her boyfriend was ""older"". Jennifer has a flashback to this era, which is portrayed as deeply nostalgic and a sweet romance in which she was able to find herself as a confident young woman. She pictures the 1970's almost like a bright super 8 home movie and seems to find it much more endearing than her own adult life. She imagines herself as being older and sophisticated as she re-reads the essay herself, but is surprised at how small and childlike she appears in photos from that time. Rethinking back on that time, she is now portrayed as a shy and awkward little girl whose parents often argue and ignore her. Jennifer's relationship began one summer when she went to a mysterious and intensive horse training camp with three other girls. She lived with the beautiful and enigmatic Mrs. G (Elizabeth Debiki), who also had Jenny and the girls run with professional coach Bill Allens (Jason Ritter), who was in his forties. Bill often treats the girls as a small elite group, getting them to refer to him by the unexplained nickname ""Naga"", which Jennifer finds cult-like looking back on it. She decides to get in touch with one of the other girls from the camp, an obese teenager named Franny (Tina Parker), who is now an adult woman running her own horse farm. Franny surprisingly has remained very close with the now frail and horribly aged Mrs. G, who reveals that her real husband (Grant James) is suffering from bouts of illness and that her bespectacled young son whom Jennifer was fond of, David (Brett Justin Koppel) passed away at a young age. Jennifer means to ask Mrs. G. about her childhood but is unable to bring herself to do it considering the tragic circumstances which have been brought up. Mrs. G. meanwhile makes a few bizarre comments about her own family, including that her mother ""preferred the dogs to her"". It is revealed that as a child in Britain, Mrs. G. may have been neglected and sexually abused.Jennifer goes with Mrs. G. and Franny to try riding again, and has flashbacks to an embarrassing time in which she fell off her own horse. Not long after though, she has a live show and displays her riding skills, getting closer to Bill in the process, whom she now considers a dear friend. Mrs. G. and Bill offer to drive her to a diner for lunch, playing Gordon Lightfoot music and chatting about Jennifer's own lonely and dysfunctional home life. As they eat, Mrs. G and Bill reveal to Jennifer that they are lovers. Jennifer reassures them that she's glad they're happy, and agrees to write letters to them after the summer when she returns home for school. After the camp, Jennifer keeps her horse with Mrs. G. and continues to see her and Bill on the weekends. These memories begin to haunt the present-day adult Jennifer. Doing a demonstration while teaching a class, she gets one of her students, Joe (Daniel Berson) to volunteer to stand in front of the class, and she discusses how a person's defensive body language is often a sign that they're trying to hide something more serious about themselves.Jennifer reflects on how after the summer when she was thirteen, the visits transitioned into her spending time with Bill alone. One night she stays over at his house and gets cold, so he wraps a blanket around her before reading her a poem of his. He begins sexually grooming her, requesting that she take her top off for him so he can ogle her, eventually raping her repeatedly, telling her that they are ""making love"". This makes her uncomfortable, but at the same time it becomes an act of rebellion. Her parents still ignore her yet refuse to let her date or make friends, barring her from going to a carnival with a friend named Lucas (Noah Lomax). Ironically her father claims to be friends with Lucas's father and to like the boy's family, yet Jennifer's parents see nothing suspicious about how much time she spends with Bill and Mrs. G. Jennifer realizes that her nosy grandmother (Juli Erickson) is aware of the ""relationship"", but the two never discuss it.When Martin in the present day finds letters written to Jennifer by Bill, he says that she was raped, but she refuses to see it that way, proclaiming that she is not a victim. However she slowly begins to question whether her recollections are accurate and eventually realizes despite her protests she had been exhibiting symptoms of being sexually abused for years. In flashbacks she is shown vomiting at the thought of sex, worrying her English teacher after turning in the essay (which discusses the molestation) and talking as if she is a mature adult in spite of her young age, isolating herself. As Jennifer continues to investigate her childhood summer, she realizes that Bill and Mrs. G. were probably grooming other girls. She remembers a college student named Iris Rose (Madison David) who worked for Mrs. G. Jennifer tracks the now adult Iris Rose down who tells her that she, Mrs. G. and Bill had threesomes and orgies and that Mrs. G. was actively involved in finding women for Bill. This prompts Jennifer to remember that she was supposed to participate in group sex with Mrs. G, Bill and Iris one weekend. However Jennifer, who vomited each time she was raped by Bill, had a severe panic attack at home and barfed the day before she was due to go away for the weekend, causing her mother to keep her at home, assuming she just had the flu. Realizing she no longer wanted to be in a relationship with Bill, Jennifer called him and broke up with him, even as he pleaded with her to stay. She also informed Mrs. G. she would no longer be keeping her horse with her.In the present day Jennifer tracks down Mrs. G. at her own home, trying to get her to talk about the sexual abuse. Mrs. G. realizes that Jennifer is researching it, and wanting to sweep it under the carpet, she pretends to have no idea what Jennifer is talking about, trying to make her leave. The elderly Mr. G., whom had never abused Jennifer nor been aware of his own wife's affair with Bill, comes downstairs to greet and hug Jennifer, but as they embrace, Mrs. G. insists that she leave, looking worried that the secrets of the past will be revealed. Jennifer has a conversation with her childhood self, telling her about the toll the abuse will take on her as she gets older, claiming that she'll never be able to have an intimate relationship without being reminded of the abuse and that she'll never want to be pregnant. The childhood Jennifer, too busy wandering the school hallways swooning over a barrage of letters Bill has sent to her, claims she ""doesn't love boys and hates children anyway"". She continues to insist that she's not a victim, but freaks out when the adult Jennifer tells her that she's going to speak out about the abuse, begging her not to tell.Now as an adult, Jennifer wants to confront Bill to ask him why he sexually abused her and if there were other victims. Martin worries for her that this plan will backfire or that she may only further traumatize herself, however he understands that this process is cathartic and necessary for her recovery, adamantly telling her that he still loves her and offering to wait outside for her as she visits an awards ceremony to confront Bill at last. At the awards ceremony where an elderly Bill (John Heard) is being honored, a furious Jennifer confronts him in front of his wife and the other attendees. Bill denies everything and leaves, however a couple of other women in the room stare at Jennifer with looks of sympathy, implying that they know all too well what she is talking about. Jennifer has a panic attack, shouting, ""What? Hasn't anyone else been *coached* by Bill!?"" and runs to the women's bathroom to cry, and imagines sitting with her thirteen-year-old self, who proclaims that she is not a victim, but a hero. The two look at each other silently with mutual understanding, coming to the realization that it wasn't Jennifer's fault."

However, a television news channel procures a copy and interviews him circling the events.Ingalagi narrates that an ore of gold was discovered, by mistake (when some farmers found a strange rock in their fields, by commissioned government officials in the southern part of India's Mysore State (in present-day Kolar district, Karnataka) in 1951. Raja Krishnappa ""Rocky"" Bairya (Yash) is also born on the day of the discovery in the Mysore region, to a poor and widowed woman. Discerning the increasing demand for gold by the Cold War between US and Russia, Suryavardhan (Ramesh Indira), one of the workers that accompanied the officials kills all the government officials (to keep the news of gold discovery secret), and deceitfully sets up a company, Narachi, in that land, bought for a lease of 99 years on the pretext of mining limestone. He has five associates, all of who operate away from KGF: Kamal (Vasishta N. Simha), the son of a former associate who converts ore into Gold; Rajendra Desai (Laxman), the father of Reena (Srinidhi Shetty), & Kamal's fiance who distributes Gold in Bangalore; Andrews (B. S. Avinash), who oversees operations in the Konkan and Malabar Coasts; Guru Pandian (Achyuth Kumar), a powerful politician and president of the DYSS party who provided political cover to Suryavardhan; and Suryavardhan's brother Adheera, who was his enforcer. However, each of them have their eyes on the mines. Andrews' under-boss Shetty (Dinesh Mangaluru) is a gold smuggler in Bombay, the city that also has another smuggler, Dubai-based Inayat Khalil's (Balakrishna) eyes set on. Shetty and Inayat frequently contest the leadership of gold smuggling in Bombay.Rocky arrives in Bombay as a ten-year-old on a quest for power (as Rocky understood that money comes from power and powerful people come from powerful places) and wealth as desired by his dying mother (by lung cancer at the age of 25) and begins to work for Shetty. He becomes Shetty's henchman later and oversees the arrival of gold bars from Africa to the Bombay coast with an iron fist, and soon rises in strength and power rivaling that of Shetty's.
Then Suryavardhan has a heart attack and for the first time in many years, the ownership and riches from KGF are up for grabs. Inayat sees this as an opportunity to eliminate Shetty and take over Bombay, but Rocky stops Inayat all by himself by beating up his entire army and seizing his boats from Dubai who were delivering gold to Bombay. Shetty is afraid that Rocky is beating him in the popularity contest. The news of Rocky reaches Andrews.Andrews offers Rocky Bombay in return for assassinating Garuda (Ramachandra Raju), the elder son of Suryavardhan, who was seen to inherit KGF after his paralyzed father's passing. Rocky accepts the offer and heads to Bangalore where an event is staged for the purpose (Garuda is to come to DYSS party office for the naming of the new Chief Minister of the state, which is Gurupandiyan). Rocky is scheduled to assassinate Garuda then). Upon reaching Bangalore Rocky comes against Reena and is smitten by her. Kamal is angry about someone hitting on Reena, but Andrews protects Rocky's identity till his mission is completed. Kamal has his entire goon army looking out for Rocky and eventually finds him. But Kamal is stopped by Andrews and Rajendra Desai who tell Kamal that Rocky is the weapon to kill Garuda.
Rocky discusses his plan to kill Garuda in the DYSS party office (as every other route is heavily protected by Gaurda's men, who are determined to protect their boss outside his fortress in KGF). When Garuda arrives, Rocky witnesses the authority and power of goons that Garuda commands and has the attempt averted. Garuda had been lured to the event, for the unveiling of his father's statue, but when the statue is revealed, it is not of Suryavardhan, but of Garuda. This implies that Garuda knew everything that had been planned against him.
In addition Rocky realizes the gold he is smuggling in Bombay, doesn't come from Africa, but from KGF, which is controlled by Garuda. He found the marked trucks from Bombay in Bangalore, and tracked them down to figure out the mystery.Rocky now volunteers to go into KGF to kill Garuda as he wants complete control over the gold trade.
In 1978, at the KGF, a bedridden Suryavardhan announces Garuda as his successor overlooking Adheera, who he wants to serve as the latter's aide. Adheera orders an attack on Garuda, but misses and Garuda retaliates and doesn't miss. Adheera is presumably dead. Garuda's ruthless way of functioning aided by his commander Vanaram (Ayyappa P. Sharma) comes to fore. 400 guards rule a slave army of 20000 men.
Meanwhile Rajendra and Suryavardhan are both worried that Inayat still has his eyes on the Mumbai gold trade and he is supported by Ramika Sen, who is a politician and supports Inayat. She is fighting the national elections in upcoming polls and together they can destroy KGF and everyone linked to it.Andrews and Rajendra see the need to enter KGF and eliminate Garuda before he becomes all powerful. Rocky soon makes his way into KGF evading a unit of Garuda's henchmen and starts working in the mines like an ordinary laborer. Once there, he witnesses the brutality that the slaves are subjected to. Although apathetic at first, he is moved by a couple of incidents involving a cold-blooded killing of a mother and son at the hands of an overseer and the slaves' children hoping that he rises to liberate them. Rocky infiltrates the map room to get a pull picture of the mines and the security in it. But Garuda gets a whiff of the infiltration and decides to kill the entire last batch of slaves, which included Rocky. A fellow slave (who had seen Rocky and believed in him), sacrifices himself to save Rocky. News reaches Andrews that their man in KGF has been killed.
Beginning his attempt at it and to indicate to Desai and his men through informants, Kulkarni and Garuda's virtuous brother Virat (Vinay Bidappa), that he was alive, as planned, Rocky engages in a fight with a unit of twenty-one overseers killing each one of them in order to save a blind slave they were about to kill.With the act, Rocky emerges as a hero in the slaves' eyes. An alerted Vanaram now informs Garuda who heads toward the mines from his palatial residence. To avert thousands of slaves being killed due to his fury, Virat (Garuda's brother who has returned from London) smothers father Suryavardhan to death and sidetracks Garuda, who rushes back home. At the mines, Rocky seizes the opportunity, conspires and unsuspectingly heads through a tunnel to the site where Garuda has decided to behead three slaves as offerings to a deity. Upon Garuda's return to the site and sacrifice of two slaves, a concealed Rocky emerges and beheads him. The ecstatic slaves accept him as their leader as they cheer him on. The narrator concludes that Rocky intentionally chose KGF as the site to assassinate Garuda, in order to earn the will of an ""army of people"", the slaves, before he seized KGF to his control. He adds that Prime Minister Ramika Sen later ordered the Indian Army to have Rocky, by then who was labeled as ""India's biggest criminal"", killed."

BRAID is the female driven psychological thriller and horror story of Petula Thames and Tilda Darlings, two self proclaimed artists turned dealers and schemers on the run.

One unfortunate night, they mishandle eighty thousand dollars worth of narcotics and are given 48 hours to pay their vengeful drug lord back. The girls leave town and arrive at a desolate, gothic mansion in the countryside with the plan of robbing their wealthy childhood friend, Daphne Peters. Daphne inherited a fortune when she was little and has since been living secluded in the manor her whole life, growing into a dangerous schizophrenic agoraphobe, prisoner of the fantasy world the three created as children. To take her money the girls have to take part in Daphne's twisted and violent game of make believe. The three of them quickly descend into a deadly maze of hallucinations, role play, torture and murder. A female version of A Clockwork Orange, Mulholland Drive meets Heavenly Creatures meets Funny Games, with The Others twist at the end. Two wanted women-on-the-run decide to rob their wealthy, yet mentally unstable, friend who lives in a fantasy world they all created as children. To take her money, the fugitive girls must take part in their host's deadly and perverse game of make-believe, in a sprawling yet decaying estate. As things become increasingly hallucinatory and violent, the duo soon realize that obtaining the cash may be the least of their concerns. Petula and Tilda are young artists in New York who make a living as drug dealers. After losing their stash and money while barely escaping police, they are given two days to repay their supplier. The two connect with Daphne, a wealthy, unstable childhood friend who lives alone in a remote rural mansion, in the hopes of finding a safe in her house that is full of money. The girls rekindle an intricate fantasy game they played as children - one in which Tilda assumes the role of a young girl, Daphne as her mother, and Petula a visiting doctor. The game has three rules - everyone must play, no outsiders allowed, and nobody leaves.Daphne makes Petula do increasingly bizarre things as the game progresses, such as hitting Tilda's knee with a hammer and simulating sexual intercourse with Daphne. Tilda suffers from a bad drug trip, interspersed with a flashback of an argument between the three girls during their childhood that lead to Daphne being pushed out of the treehouse and landing on her head, resulting in her current unstable mental state which causes her to believe the game they're playing is real. In the present, Daphne has bound and gagged Petula and Tilda, having fully lost herself to the delusion that she is actually their mother.Daphne is visited by Detective Siegel, who knew all three girls when they were children. Siegel claims that her neighbors have reported hearing screams from her home. Though Daphne's odd behavior makes him suspicious, he leaves after she reminds him that he doesn't have a search warrant. Daphne later gives Petula clues to the location and code of the safe, and promises to free the girls if she can find it. Petula succeeds and the girls escape, but are pursued by Daphne, who runs Petula over with her car before taking them back to her mansion.Daphne cuffs Petula to a chair and locks Tilda in a cage, forcing the latter to watch as she gives Petula a Glasgow smile. The next morning, Daphne tells them that the ""game"" has concluded and that they are free to leave, but also that she believes she has become pregnant from her faux sexual encounter with Petula. Realizing that this gives them new power over her, Petula restarts the game by convincing Daphne that she needs to be taken in for an emergency caesarean section.Just as the two girls are about to attack an unconscious Daphne with surgical tools, Spiegel enters and holds them at gunpoint, but Daphne wakes up and repeatedly stabs him. Tilda gleefully joins her, while Petula initially watches on in horror, but eventually joins the other two in bludgeoning him to death. They bury his body in Daphne's yard before all three women return to living in the mansion and playing the game, their scars from the injuries inflicted by Daphne having miraculously disappeared. As Petula grows increasingly wary of her surroundings, it is eventually revealed that the entire movie has taken place within Daphne's mansion - every event that occurred up until this point was merely a part of the game, which Tilda is in on as well - and that Petula has tried to escape several times, only to be punished each time by having her arms burned. All three women commit suicide, though this is later revealed to be staged as well when the game starts anew, showing Daphne as an old woman in a withering house, revealing that they have been playing the game for several years."

The residents of Chanderi believe in the myth of an angry woman ghost, referred to as ""Stree"" (Hindi for woman) (Flora Saini), who stalks men during Durga Puja festival. This is explained by the sudden disappearance of these men, leaving their clothes behind.Vicky (Rajkummar Rao), a tailor in Chanderi, falls in love with a mysterious, anonymous girl (Shraddha Kapoor) who is only seen during that festival season. Her frequent disappearances make his friends suspicious, and they start believing that she could be Stree haunting the city, but Vicky believes that his friends are only gossiping.

After one of his friends, Jaana (Abhishek Banerjee), disappears in the same fashion (after Vicky pees on the writing on the wall, which erases the warning to Stree), Vicky attempts to research the myth and its verifiability. He continues to go out with his girl, who makes him bring strange artifacts (lizards' tail, cat's hair and so on), but Vikcy is too head over heels in love with her to care.

She was destitute and was given shelter by one man, who was lynched by the village. So, now Stree is out for her revenge and won't sit idle till even a single guy is alive in the village.
The author informs them of a riddle pointing to a savior from Stree, who is later found to be Vicky. Vicky, his friends, Rudra, and the girl attack Stree, but Vicky leaves her alive (even after the girl subdues the Stree and asks Vicky to drive a stake through her heart. But Vicky refuses to do the same injustice that the village did with her so many years ago) after cutting her magical hair, which renders her powerless. His mysterious girlfriend is seen at the bus station the next day, where Vicky bids her farewell without asking her name. While on the bus, the girl is revealed to be carrying the hair Vicky had cut from Stree, which she places with the rest of her own hair, as all powers of a witch reside in her hair. She disappears from the bus, suggesting that she could be another witch.Stree visits Chanderi again the following year and finds her statue at the town entrance with the words ""O Stree, raksha karna"" (Hindi for Hey woman, protect us) instead of ""O Stree kal aana"", because Vicky told everybody in the village that Stree was not looking for honeymoon, but only for love and respect."
A Fortunate Man,2018,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8436026/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A gifted engineer flees his austere roots to pursue wealth and success among Copenhagen's elite, but the pride propelling him threatens to be his ruin. In the late 19th century, Peter Sidenius is an ambitious young man from a devout Christian family in Western Denmark, who travels to the Danish capital of Copenhagen to study engineering, rebelling against his clergyman father. He comes into contact with the intellectual circles of a wealthy, Jewish family and seduces the elder daughter, Jakobe. Per, as he now calls himself, conceives a large-scale engineering project including the construction of a series of canals in his native Jutland, and lobbies for its construction. But just as Per seems to be about to make his dreams come true, his pride stands in the way. Peter is an ambitious young man from a devout Christian family in Western Denmark in the late 19th century, who rebels against his strict father by traveling to the capital to study. He comes to seduce the daughter of a wealthy Jewish family.—OJT Lykke-Per is a novel by Danish Nobel Prize-winning author Henrik Pontoppidan published in eight volumes between 1898 and 1904. It is considered one of the major Danish novels, and in 2004 it was made part of the Danish Culture Canon.The novel tells the story of Per Sidenius a self-confident bright young man who breaks with his religious family in order to become an engineer to construct energy saving wind turbines. However, at the height of his success, his family background catch up with him and he gives up his career and his love for a wealthy and intelligent Jewess. For the character of Per Sidenius, Pontoppidan drew on his own biography as a Jutlandic vicar's son who traveled to Copenhagen to train as an engineer before becoming an author.The novel was well received by German literati such as Thomas Mann, Georg Lukács, and Ernst Bloch, who considered it ""a cosmopolitan masterpiece of epochal sweep and a profound social, psychological, and metaphysical anatomy of the modernist transition"" . While it had been translated into 11 languages before the end of the 20th century, the first English translation was published in 2010 by Naomi Lebowitz .A major theme of the story is the relation of ""luck"" to ""happiness"", the Danish word lykke means both. While Per initially considers happiness to be the result of success and the achievement of projects and goals in the mundane world, he eventually realizes that happiness can be achieved independently of the luck that leads to success. For Pontoppidan, Per's withdrawal from the bustling scene of Copenhagen is therefore not to be understood as defeat, but as a victory over the very circumstances that defines success. .Plot
Per Sidenius is a young aspiring engineer from a devout Christian family in Western Denmark, he renounces his faith and travels to Copenhagen to study at the Polytechnical University, and to achieve his personal objective of becoming ""a conqueror"".In Copenhagen he comes into contact with the Modern as a revolutionary force in the form of the natural sciences and technology, but also the cosmopolitan and intellectual circles of the wealthy Jewish milieu in Copenhagen. He becomes a friend of the banker Philip Salomon and has a brief and tense relationship with his daughter Jakobe. Per conceives a large scale engineering project and plans the construction of a series of canals and harbor systems in his native Jutland, and starts lobbying for its construction with the political and academic establishment. When academia dismisses the idea as unfeasible, he nonetheless manages to gain support through his contacts to the bank world who turn out to be more progressive. Nonetheless the project eventually fails and he returns to Jutland where he again embraces his Christian roots and lives the last years of his life in ascetic contemplation while carrying out the dreary work of a civil servant.""When, in spite of all the good fortune that had come his way, he wasn't happy, it was because he had not wanted to be happy in the general sense of the word."""

Josie,2018,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4682780/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Hank, a solitary man living a dull existence in the sleepy, Southern town raises eyebrows when he develops a questionable relationship with Josie, a recently transplanted high school student. In Baymont, which is not in Texas, Hank lives at the Pink Motel where he takes care of a pair of tortoises. He likes to fish, and he parks in front of the local high school and tells kids where they shouldn't be parking and what they shouldn't be doing. No, he doesn't have a child going there and he is not creepy. Guarding the parking area seems to be his job.Several times Hank sees a vision of a mean-looking man in an orange prison jumpsuit.One day a teenage girl named Josie moves into the motel. She was told by Romero, who does landscaping work, that Hank was a big strong man who would help her move in. Josie is very nice but always wears short shorts (except when she is wearing a swimsuit at the motel's pool) and she seems like a rebel. She has long blonde hair. Josie gives three people three different explanations of why she moved there. One version is that her parents are coming later and she is getting settled first, which doesn't make sense because school will soon be out. Another version is that her father is in the military in Germany and her mother moved there with him but she did not want to go. A third version is that her single mother raised her but now she is deceased.Josie is new at the local high school and she is in Ms. Elkins' class. She sits down next to Marcus, who seems interested in her. She likes him too. Ms. Elkins has just assigned a project which is due in three weeks, and everyone will need a partner. Luckily, with Josie in the class there is an even number of students. Josie and Marcus want to be partners, which upsets Marcus' friend Gator, who looks like Axl Rose and wanted to partner with Marcus on the project.Marcus arrives at the motel to work with Josie and is dismayed to learn that jerk who patrols the parking area is there too. During the night, Hank's truck is vandalized but it's not certain Marcus did it. Marcus tells Josie there is something strange about Hank, because no one knows his past, but there are people that believe he committed terrible crimes.Gordie and Martha live at the motel. It's not clear whether they run the place. Martha is nice to everyone but when alone with Gordie she seems to want to meddle in everyone's business. Gordie, a ""make America great"" type, has been kind of a jerk, calling Hank ""Hanky-Panky"". And while he is just joking, Gordie wants to see proof Romero is in the country legally, but Romero was born in El Paso, or so he says.Martha invites Josie to the Memorial Day cookout, and Josie invites Hank, who is sort of antisocial and has never seemed interested in such events. Josie builds a race course for Hank's tortoises, so part of the entertainment is a tortoise race. Francine is the winner. Gordie and Hank become better friends. Josie leaves afterward to party with her school friends and of course she comes back drunk.Marcus continues to show up at the motel, and he wants to do more than schoolwork. Hank interferes, either because he wants to be like Josie's father or because he is secretly attracted to her. If it is the latter, Martha thinks that is sick, and she confronts Hank one night to tell him so. Hank does show up dressed nice carrying flowers, but Marcus is there.Hank takes Josie to the marina, where he is considering buying a nicer boat. It is there that he tells Josie his story. He worked at the Huntsville, Texas prison that is known for executing more people than any other U.S. prison. It was his job to (along with several other guards) tie up the condemned when the sentence was carried out. And one man was found to be innocent years after the fact. That led Hank to quit his job and leave Huntsville. He has never gotten over being a part of that.One night Josei and hank are just sitting and talking. Josie says she was taught about Jesus as a child and her mother, who was apparently raising her alone, ridiculed the idea. Hank isn't religious, while Josie says she has continued to wonder.Josie wants Marcus and Hank to get along, so she has them come together to talk out their differences, and they agree to be civil to each other. As they are talking, Hank tells Marcus how much he enjoys fishing, and Marcus says he likes to hunt. He even pulls out a knife that even Crocodile Dundee would respect. Marcus and Hank are drinking, and Hank appears to pass out. His vision of the man in prison is much longer this time, as the audience sees what happened when the innocent man was put to death. A little girl with a woman who might be her mother is seeing all this. Why would a little girl be there?The audience soon learns the answer. Hank wakes up tied to a chair and Josie finally tells him her real story. She has a photo of herself at age 4 with her father, just before he was arrested. Josie and her mother visited for years, and then one day her father was executed. It is clear she somehow knew how to find Hank, and she seems to say she has looked for others who played a role in her father's death. While at first Josie gives Hank credit for having regrets, that isn't enough, and she cuts Hank's throat with Marcus' knife.Hank narrates the next scene, which repeats the movie's opening. Cops show up. This time the audience learns why. Marcus has been framed and he is taken away. The cops know that Hank and Marcus both seemed to be attracted to Josie and that they didn't get along.

Kate Fuller (Olga Kurylenko), a criminal psychologist, is called by Detective McCarthy to diagnose Helena and deduce whether to commit her to a mental institute. Upon interviewing both Helena and Sophie, both insist that Mr. Wynsfield was killed by the sleep demon, Mara. Kate signs to have Helena committed.Kate experiences sleep paralysis and sees a figure walking in her apartment. The next day, she goes to speak to a man named Takahashi. However, she instead finds his decayed corpse, killed in the same manner as Mr. Wynsfield. McCarthy disbelieves the Mara legend. Kate visits Helena in the mental institution, who explains how she and her husband knew a man named Dougie from a Sleep Paralysis support group, and begs Kate to let her see her daughter again, insisting she will die at the hands of Mara; as proof, she shows Kate a red mark in her left eye, explaining that Mara marks her victims.Kate decides to attend the Sleep Paralysis support group run by Dr. Ellis, where she encounters Dougie, who insists that Mara is real and will kill Saul.

Physical contact; 4. You see her when you're awake, and if you fall asleep, you'll die. Mara only appears when someone is in a deep sleep; thus, Dougie only sleeps in brief intervals, keeping alarms and blaring music on in his house.Kate goes to talk with Dr. Ellis, who disbelieves in Mara, explaining that sleep paralysis demons can appear based on a person's culture.

Chief among them is the skater Adam, who has two children from two different women, a young Latino slacker who is inexplicably the town's resident sex symbol and apparently irresistible to women; Inez, his live-in lover; and ""Marfa Girl"", now the mother of a baby boy as the result of a brutal rape.—Rotten T."

Let's look at the history of the man for the plot summary. Don Aronow was born the youngest son of Russian Jewish immigrants in 1927 in Brooklyn New York, Sheepshead Bay neighborhood of Brooklyn, then leaving New Jersey in 1961 after a successful career in the construction industry from 1953. In 1959 he was to move to South Miami and start as a hobby racing boats in design.He soon became the king of power boats. Of the World's most recognized racing boat companies, Don Aronow established Magnum Marine, Cary, Cigarette, Donzi, and Formula speedboats. In 1964 he started Donzi Marine made the Donzi brand an international success and quickly sold the company to Teleflex Inc. in mid 1965. In 1966, he founded Magnum Marine and in 1967 proceeded to win his first World Championship driving two 27' Magnums, a single engine inboard and a triple engine Mercury powered outboard.He himself became the US and World Powerboat Champion many times which helped establish his racing prowess and his boats. His boats won over 350 offshore races and he was a two time world champion and three time U.S. champion. He had been elected to all power-boating Hall of Fame in existence with him and Gar Wood were the only two Americans to have ever received the UIM Gold Medal of Honor.He got the attention of Presidents, Princes and the privileged. As businessman, Aronow applied a no questions asked policy. If the money was there, a boat would be supplied. His fast life led to a speedy death, that hint to indiscretions, from his early days, to his tragic murder in 1987 in the middle of his reign.Plot Summary is close to the history of the man, Aronow. Starts with him leaving New Jersey with implications that he must move due to the relationship with Meyer Lansky in the construction business.Arronow had become a millionaire by this time and moving to South Miami was a good move as to avoid any prosecutions that may have come his way. He moved with his wife and three children. The movie outlines he has many affairs and paints a poor husband / father type. During this movie he divorces his wife after the catalyst where his oldest son loses his ability to walk in an accident. As far as his romantic life he sees a lovely woman with New Jersey history and was a model who was dating a very substantial Latin mobster and worked his way to meet her. He does end up marrying this woman and having one son with her.During the duration of the movie there is are clashes between him and Meyer Lansky's nephew. Also, throughout the movie there are several incidents where the events of him and ties to the mob are shown.Overall, this movie has weaknesses in establishment of characters. Al characters are shown as lack luster and their build up as well as boring with no excitement of truly interesting people. The director of this film could have made the movie so much more worthy with not only character build up but actual representation of the boats. Where ever the boats are shown have no excitement of what these boats really are. The race in choppy waters where Aronow not only comes in late due to poor weather but wins looks like special effects of the the late 1950's.This is an interesting story although just another mobster, greed and death representation. However, with that said with strong direction and improvement of the poor special effects and an actual representation of boat Racing and these awesome boats could have made this now mediocre movie in to a moderate movie. Jodi Scurfield with absolutely no industry history of any kind, should not have been selected for this project. To have made this a good/great movie would have been a monumental task that I do not feel could have been accomplished. The story is lack luster and my thoughts could not capture any reasonable size of audience. - Martin Snytsheuvel."

After being informed of the sudden death of her long lost composer father, a young virtuoso violinist, Rose Fisher (Freya Tingley), inherits an old mansion in which he used to live. There, she discovers her father's final work: a mysterious music score marked with strange symbols. With the help of Charles Vernais (Simon Abkarian), her agent and manager, she deciphers the symbols and, little by little, starts to unlock secrets concerning her father's past, setting in motion the mechanisms of a somber plan imagined since the day she was born. They soon discover that there's more to the sonata in question than meets the eye which, when played, triggers and unleashes dark and terrifying forces.—Happy_Evil_Dude Violin virtuoso Rose Fisher and her agent Charles Vernais learn Rose's estranged father committed suicide by setting himself on fire. Charles is shocked to discover Rose's father was Richard Marlowe, a celebrated composer who notoriously turned into an eccentric recluse. Rose and Charles fight over their strained professional relationship when Rose decides to postpone her commitments in order to visit the remote French estate she inherited from her father.At Marlowe's mansion, Rose briefly meets her father's former housekeeper Therese. When she goes into town to buy cigarettes later, store patrons stare strangely at Rose upon learning who her father was.Rose finds sheet music for a seemingly unfinished violin sonata locked inside her father's desk. Rose notices strange occult symbols on the pages. A demonic shape briefly appears behind Rose when she plays part of the music on a piano.Rose calls Charles to apologize. She also tells Charles about the sonata and sends him pictures of the pages to see if he can make sense of the symbols.A haunting presence and childlike voice draw Rose back to the music room. Rose discovers a clock with a mark matching one of the sonata symbols.Recognizing the sonata as Marlowe's final masterpiece, Charles shows the piece to former client and musical prodigy James. James observes that the music is barely coherent in certain places. Unable to decipher the score further, James refers Charles to music historian Sir Victor Ferdinand, who used to work with Marlowe.After examining the pages, Victor shows Charles a book on occult history. Victor links the strange symbols to a French secret society that believed music allowed mortals to communicate with the devil and that they could conjure the antichrist by using music to open an otherworldly portal. Charles begins suffering from intermittent headaches after Victor plays a portion of the score on his piano.Rose finds a collection of newspaper clippings about her musical success that Marlowe kept. She also finds one of the occult symbols etched inside the fireplace when the flames burn hot. Rose then suffers from a nightmarish vision in which her burning father points toward a living statue of two cherubs outside.Charles arrives at the estate. Charles tells Rose about the French secret sect by identifying the four symbols as representing the four faces of evil: power, immortality, appearance, and duality. Together they form a fifth symbol of evil, which is also the symbol of the occult order.Rose shows Charles the symbols she found on the clock and in the fireplace. From those clues, Rose and Charles heat the sheet music, which reveals hidden music notes. They also conclude that the score must be played out of time since Marlowe's clock was an hour behind.At Rose's suggestion, Charles meets with Therese to find out if Marlowe's housekeeper saw any other symbols inside the mansion. Therese mentions seeing one of the symbols behind a mirror, spurring Charles to conclude the music must be played backwards. Therese also mentions that Marlowe used to disappear into the woods for long periods of time and that townspeople suspected him in the disappearances of local children.Rose finds an old chapel hidden in the woods. Stairs lead Rose to an underground chamber where she discovers a mural depicting a demon, torture tools, and audio tapes of Marlowe murdering children to record their specific screams.Rose encounters several ghost children in the forest on her way back to the mansion. Rose tells Charles what she found. With Charles growing increasingly insistent about decoding the sonata, Rose shows him the duality symbol discovered earlier on the cherub twin statue outside. The clue reveals that the sheet music pages must be overlaid on top of each other.Charles finds the fifth and final symbol painted into a rose on a portrait of Marlowe. With the sonata deciphered, Charles explains that Marlowe wrote the score specifically for his daughter Rose because he needed her pure soul to play the piece, which was partly composed from the kidnapped children's screams.Determining the music to be evil, Rose goes to burn the pages and call the police. Overcome with obsession, Charles chokes Rose before forcing her to play the sonata.Rose's eyes begin glowing as she plays her violin. Four ghost children materialize in the room. A demonic entity appears and kills Charles. The windows shatter when Rose plays the final note. Therese finds Charles' dead body the next day.Some time later at the Royal London Concert Hall, Victor attends a recital featuring Rose.

In the Dark Ages, after the death of his daughter, a fierce warrior known simply as ""The Father"" begins amassing a gruesome collection of heads of monsters he stakes to the wall of his cabin. The Father lives alone in solitude; his only company is his horse Jakke. Most of his time is spent repairing his armor, setting traps for animals, visiting his daughter's grave, and using the blood and organs of monsters to create a healing potion that heals wounds almost instantly.The Father earns his living as a bounty hunter by hunting down the beasts that terrorize a nearby kingdom. Each time the kingdom has a new bounty, a large horn sounds off, and a new bounty is pinned to a large tree just outside the castle walls. Throughout he is shown taking the bounty, leaving to hunt down his target, then returning with the target's head which he pins to his wall. Many of these hunts leave The Father wounded and maimed, forcing him to use the elixir to heal himself. During one such hunt, he returns on foot after Jakke is killed. Soon after making a grave for his companion and visiting his daughter's grave, another bounty is posted. Much to his surprise, it is revealed to be the creature responsible for his daughter's death.Traveling far north to an island, he finds the monster in a cave. After a hard battle he finally decapitates the monster and travels home to pay respects to his daughter.

Discovering what transpired, The Father prepares to hunt down the revived creature as it searches for a new body.As nightfall arrives, the Father begins a game of wits against the creature, with it digging up the daughter's grave and attaching its head to her corpse. After a lengthy chase, the Father seemingly kills the creature by severing its head from his daughter's corpse and stabbing it repeatedly in the head.Reburying his daughter the next morning, the Father returns home. After cleaning up the mess left from the previous night, he leaves the cabin to begin repairs on his armor. While doing so, he suddenly cries out in shock and pain before going silent.

The Father's severed head is then revealed to be the one that was pinned to the wall, and the creature, its head now attached to the Father's body, leaves taking one of the jars of elixir along with it, gloating as it walks away saying, ""Body Mine!""

Clara,2018,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6613878/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"An obsessive astronomer and a curious artist form an unlikely bond which leads them to a profound, scientific discovery. Dr. Isaac Bruno, an astronomer and astrophysics professor at Ontario University in Toronto, has been obsessed with needing to discover that there is life in the cosmos besides on Earth. This obsession has been a negative Catch-22 in his life: he has needed this focus to fill a void in his personal life following a tragedy that partly led to the dissolution of his marriage to fellow astronomer Dr. Rebecca Jenkins, while the frustration he has felt in such a discovery not yet having been made has resulted in him acting inappropriately in all aspects of his life. That professional behavior has in turn led to he being indefinitely suspended from the university, which also means no access to university resources or equipment hindering that search. It is bad timing as advances in telescope technology, such as TESS, not only provides much data to the community, but any evidence as to the possibility of life would provide access to that technology. Desperate for help without many resources, he advertises for an unpaid assistant, beyond the provision of room and board. The only application he receives is from Clara, an artist not only with no astrophysics background but little education let alone at a post-secondary level, she who he suspects is more interested in the room and board in being seemingly homeless. Beyond her dog Eeva, her prized possessions are a collection of rocks she carries with her everywhere, obtained most from her world travels, one from and indicative of each continent. Isaac ends up hiring her on her plea of hard work and learning fast. Regardless of what Isaac may or may not find with Clara's help, she, who has a keen sense of observation being an artist, may provide him with something more valuable for his life in a holistic sense.—Huggo About 48 years after man landed on the moon, Dr. Isaac Bruno, an astronomy professor who lives in area code 416, is one of many attempting to discover the next planet that supports life, and the new Tess telescope which is being launched will help them greatly.

In a class that has 250 students (though obviously they are not all there), he makes some strange remarks, such as explaining that facts are real and feelings are meaningless, and their chances at succeeding in a relationship can be determined using an equation. Isaac has also broken the rules on telescope usage. Therefore, his superior informs him he will no longer be teaching or doing research using university facilities.Isaac tries to do research using his own computer but he is unable to access what he needs. He advertises for an assistant who will be given room and board but no pay. Clara (pronounced like tomorrow) shows up outside his apartment building with her dog Eeva. She wants the job. Asked what her qualifications are, she has none. She says, however, that she is a hard worker and learns fast. Isaac is not convinced but she pleads to be allowed to let her dog have some water.While Clara and Eeva are inside, Isaac finally agrees to let Clara be his assistant. The audience has seen her before working on a beautiful painting, based on a photo of a large colorful ring in outer space, on a wall in the building where Isaac teaches. And Isaac saw Eeva tied up outside.Clara asks if Isaac has ever been married and he will only say that his wife is gone.Clara notices Isaac's extensive collection of vinyl records and asks to play one.

And a security guard shows up, so they have to leave.Charlie isn't pleased Isaac pretended to be him, but he and Isaac are still friends. And that isn't all. Dr. Rickman later goes on TV claiming to have made the discovery with all of Isaac's data.One night Clara asks for something besides a t-shirt to sleep in. Isaac still has a lot of Rebecca's stuff. So he says Clara can wear something of Rebecca's. Clara finds baby clothes with a tag still attached.It turns out Rebecca is still alive but left Isaac and went to work at Cal Tech.

Isaac refuses to believe without evidence.Clara is ""under the weather"" and Isaac doesn't seem to understand he should be taking care of her.At long last, Isaac and Clara find another planet. This one is the size of Jupiter, but something smaller is connected with the planet. Isaac presents his findings to Dr. Rickman, who was about to catch a plane. Dr. Rickman thinks Isaac's idea is silly but Isaac is very convincing as he explains a small satellite such as a moon could not be traveling with a Jupiter-sized planet without intervention by intelligent beings. It is, he believes, a space station.Clara has an even worse episode and Isaac returns to the apartment to find her either dead or passed out. at the hospital, the doctor explains Clara has an immune disorder and the drugs were just relieving her symptoms. This was going to happen eventually. Isaac spends more time with Clara but eventually she says her last words, something about wanting Isaac to see how wonderful something is.Two years later, Isaac is absent as the presentation is made of the discovery he helped make. Rebecca has a two-year-old named Paul. Communication has been received from the mysterious satellite. Isaac is there when attempts are made to understand what is being said. A brief message is interpreted. It says, ""Isaac Bruno"". At the start of the movie, Isaac had demonstrated to his students that any data can be represented as sound, and this may be the solution. The longer message, when converted to sound, is a Bob Dylan song."

Mission of Honor,2018,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7515456/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The exploits of 303 Squadron RAF during the Battle of Britain. The squadron consisted of Polish pilots, many of whom were veterans of the air battles involved in Germany's invasion of Poland. Mission of Honor is the story of Hurricane Squadron 303, a group of brave pilots who fought in the skies over England in WW2, not just to keep Great Britain free from the Nazis, but also to keep alive the very idea of their own country, which had existed in its modern form for barely twenty years before it was crushed between the opposing jaws of Germany and Russia. Equipped with the almost-obsolete Hurricane and (with some initial reluctance) given RAF blue uniforms, while they fought, Poland lived. 1940. Great Britain stands alone in Europe against the growing stain of the rampant Nazi empire, its nervous inhabitants wondering what the future holds. But a handful of people on this beleaguered island know only too well what one possible future might hold. They have seen Warsaw burn, Poland crumble, France capitulate. Men like Jan Zumbach, Witold Urbanowicz, Miroslaw Feric and Tolo Lokuciewski, pilots of the Polish Air Force, who know that if the Luftwaffe isn't stopped, then Poland, Holland and France were just Hitler's hors d'oeuvres. So they are ready to fight, if they are given the planes. The problem is the British don't trust 'the bloody Poles'. And so the pilots, strangers in what seems a very strange land indeed, will over the course of a few months have to fight several wars at once - with the xenophobia of the authorities and the public, with the language, the unfamiliar Hurricane fighters, with the battle-hardened Luftwaffe. But once they are reluctantly made operational by the RAF, the Polish fighters show what they can do, out-gunning the enemy and out-scoring their allies. The once hostile British fete the Polish flyers as heroes - saviours, even. Now, though, the Poles have a fresh enemy - themselves, as nerves and fatigue take a terrible toll on men pushed to the limit by constant aerial warfare, fighting to save their own country above a foreign land. Not all will make it. Not all friendships will survive. And when it's over, Jan Zumbach will contemplate a pyrrhic victory, as Poland is handed over to Stalin's puppets. The story of the Polish fliers who found themselves fighting for the freedom of their own country in foreign skies. Seen through the eyes of a Polish fighter ace and adventurer, it tells how the Poles-driven across Europe by the German war machine-finally make their last stand. Flying Hurricanes for the RAF over Britain, they became a key component in the legend of 'The Few'. Up against the might of the Luftwaffe they hoped that, by saving Great Britain from Nazi invasion, they were keeping the dream of a free Poland alive."

Asher (Ron Perlman) is a contract killer who's spent the better part of his life ending other lives, taking orders from Avi (Richard Dreyfuss).

When Avi hands Asher three contracts for a revenge scheme, the hitman takes the job, only to lose consciousness due to health issues, making accidental contact with Sophie (Famke Janssen), a ballet teacher distraught over mother Dora (Jacqueline Bisset), who's losing her battle with dementia. Asher and Sophie make a connection, embarking on a tentative courtship where the murderer can't share anything about his life. As the pair work out their flirtations, Asher is forced to pair with Uzi on a group hit, and when that goes bad for a moment, the veteran soon becomes marked for death, threatening all the good that's come into his world.—blu-ray.com Former Mossad agent Asher, who lives a minimalist and solitary life in Brooklyn but who also enjoys the finer things, is nearing the end of his career as a hitman, due to a combination of his age, dealing with the effects of not fully treated physical wounds, and a changing business about which he has no control, such as much work that would have previously gone to him now going to those he mentored. He gets his assignments through a middleman, Abram, who operates a front of a dry cleaner, and who he implicitly trusts. Against the creed he has set for himself, he forgoes that solitary life both professionally and personally. Against his better judgment, he accepts a job working with a group led by one of those he mentored, Uziel, this rule in not knowing the mindset of those with who he may be working. And arguably for the first time, he meets a woman, Sophie, a ballet teacher, with who he can picture a post-hitman life, despite their meeting being in a close call in a hit that went slightly awry, she an innocent bystander who almost witnessed that hit. Their time together is even more complicated by she being the primary caregiver to her mother Dora who is quickly slipping away as a person living with dementia. But the changing business may dictate more than anything if he will be able to realize his vision of that post-hitman life.—Huggo"

Scott and Sid,2018,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4702346/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"From their first encounter as teenagers in high school, Scott and Sid seem unlikely friends. Scott is a shambolic dreamer, intent on carving out his own path in life and holding up a metaphorical middle finger to anyone who tries to stop him. He is a quintessential troubled teen: on his fifth high school by the age of fifteen, alienated from his peers, crippled by recurring nightmares and disliked by his own foster parents. Sid, on the other hand, wants nothing more than to be liked. An unconfident, awkward recluse through circumstance, Sid's impoverished and dysfunctional background leave him no time for friends and no money for hobbies. And then Scott arrives in town, and Sid's whole world is turned upside down, as the pair embark on a journey of Dreamchasing, the personal code that they agree to live by. Through persistence and trust, sharing secrets and testing their faith in each other, Scott and Sid become embroiled in an adventure that leads them through doubts, deprivation and demon-black days, from the desolate back alleys of their hometown to the billboards of Hollywood. Fighting against the limits of their own upbringings, outsmarting the local gangsters, always staying one step ahead and just the right side of the law and almost always smiling, their friendship is tested again and again, but they will stop at nothing to achieve their ultimate aim. School boys Scott (Richard Mason) and Sid (Tom Blyth) are isolated, under achieving and a little lost when Scott transfers to Sid's school as a teen. Sid is the withdrawn, awkward son of an alcoholic mother and absent father, who just wants to work hard, get through his exams and escape into his own life. Scott, meanwhile, is an unloved foster child who's been expelled from multiple schools, rootless and uncontainable. Neither receives much encouragement from their parents or teachers, but as their friendship takes root they find something in each other that enables them to glimpse a bigger goal. Despairing of the compromise and limited ambitions around them, and in defiance of the low expectations that everyone has for them, Scott and Sid write a list of goals and begin pursuing each one in turn to create a better life. The withdrawn, overly serious Sid is inspired by Scott's wild and untamed spirit, while Scott draws strength from Sid's boundless work ethic and determination to get ahead. They become 'Dreamchasers', building their whole lifestyle and ideology around pushing themselves farther and faster than anyone expects. Fuelled by ambition and entrepreneurial spirit they launch two successful businesses while still at school, and by their late teens they're reaching for the stars - even if it means putting themselves in real danger from gangsters and loan sharks. But item number one on their list still remains: 'make a film'. And so they chase their biggest dream yet, in an inspirational underdog tale that's based on the filmmakers' true story."

That is, until English lawyer Katherine Rookwood walks into the diner with an offer they can't refuse. This anarchic thriller presents a crazy, off-kilter London of action, comedy and true love. Eddie, Paul and Katharine are cool, carefree characters in a world of absolute freedoms: freedom to steal, freedom to fire a gun, freedom to kill, and freedom to fall in love. And freedom never to be hurt--at least not seriously. Only the bad guys die. Sam Rockwell and Ben Schwartz play two London-bound buddies whose outrageous antics never have serious consequences. They always wriggle out of danger, with a wisecrack, a weapon and a smile. Eddie and Paul are two innocents abroad, except they're not innocent at all. They're low-level wise guys who never really have a grip on anything. The controlling intelligence in the story is Phoebe Fox's insecure lawyer, Katherine. She's always one step ahead of the game - but is she ready to fall in love?—tommy@dinolaine.com Eddie and Paul are Americans out on parole and working for the very demanding Louie in a greasy spoon. Paul is quirky, acts like a spoiled brat and wants to make movies and Eddie likes comic books. The viewer occasionally gets to see one of the comic books he's reading, and no, the hero is not Blue Iguana.Katherine, a pretty English lawyer, comes in the restaurant to make a deal with Eddie and Paul. She knows what they are capable of doing, and she offers $20,000 each if they will help her with a job in London. They want $30,000 each, and they want to avoid hurting anyone and she reluctantly agrees. As for how to get Louie to let them off work, Katherine has heard enough of his conversation with them to tell Louie she can get him in lots of trouble.So the three travel to London (laws are broken to get the guys there, as we find out when she needs to use this against them) and meet with Katherine's cousin Tommy and Cornelius, who we later learn was passed over for Elijah Wood in the role of a Hobbit because he was too tall (or that's what he says).The job is simple. At a museum, Paul and Eddie steal what looks like a children's backpack, and is referred to as a ""rucksack"". Someone who looks like Ken Jennings gets in the way and the blue bag, as it is called, is gone.Someone else wants whatever is in that blue bag. Deacon is a really nasty man who runs a pub. Some people call him ""Billy Ray Cyrus"" because of his hair. Late in the movie someone does a bad impression of Cyrus singing ""Achy Breaky Heart"" to make fun of him. Deacon and two bumbling idiots take over a restaurant--the accomplices put on aprons to look like they work there--and Eddie, Paul and Katherine meet and Deacon and his crew get away with the bag.Arkady is a successful businessman and not particularly nice. He is working with Deacon, but Katherine was also supposed to get him the contents of that bag in order to pay off a huge debt. He will settle for being told how to find the Americans. Believing Arkady will kill them, Katherine refuses and once again she owes Arkady a huge debt.Eddie and Paul want to quit but Katherine points out they can now get in so much trouble they will be jailed in Britain.Eddie, Paul, Katherine and Tommy set up a surveillance operation across the street from Deacon's place, in an empty building with street-style art.Eventually, Katherine discovers Arkady is after a valuable diamond called the Blue Iguana, given by a Turkish prince to his fiancee, who then loses it gambling.And so our heroes try various schemes to get their hands on the Blue Iguana and return it to its rightful owner. In one case, they are not allowed in a hotel because a zombie movie is being filmed, but when they set off an explosion for an unrelated reason, they are covered with blood and easily pass for cast members.Paul manages to convince a tough, intelligent bartender named Dawn he works for NASA and starts a relationship with her.There are other incidents which turn violent and people are killed.

Birthmarked,2018,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4702826/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Two scientists raise 3 children contrarily to their genetic tendencies to prove the ultimate power of nurture over nature. In 1977, two respected scientists, Ben Morin and his wife Catherine, quit their jobs at the university to conduct an experiment they think will revolutionize our understanding of human identity. The project aims to raise three children contrarily to their genetic predispositions to prove the ultimate power of nurture over nature. They want to prove that everyone has the same potential to become anything. Maya, a newborn girl adopted from two feeble-minded parents, is raised to be smart; while Maurice, a newborn boy adopted from two anger-prone parents, is raised to be a pacifist. Finally, their own biological son Luke, who comes from a long lineage of scientific brains, is raised to become a revered artist. The experiment will reveal little scientific truth, but rather lead Ben and Catherine to discover the true value of family.—Marc Tulin 1989. Married for thirteen years, respected scientists Drs. Ben Morin and Catherine O'Neil, each coming from a long line of respected scientists, felt like their destiny was set for them because of their biological lineage, despite certain environmental factors possibly having led them down other paths, Ben who always wanted to play basketball, and Catherine who could have been an alcoholic in being raised by one after her parents passed. In wanting to prove the power of nurture over nature due to their own circumstances, they applied for and received full funding in 1977 for a 24/7 twelve year experiment from the Gertz Foundation for the Sciences, Randolph P. Gertz III, in wanting to prove himself and not rest on the family name, encouraging applicants to be bold i.e. visionary rather than safe. That twelve years is coming to an end and thus they have to show their results. The experiment whose goal is to prove that no one is chained to his/her genetic heritage: to raise three children simultaneously isolated from the world in the country with only their approved stimuli to become contrary to their genetics. Child number one, adopted Maya, born to a long line of idiots, would be raised to become a genius. Child number two, adopted Maurice, born to a long line of violent thugs, would be raised to be a pacifist. And child number three, their own biological son Luke, would be raised to become an artist. In Ben and Catherine being bold and doing their ""parenting"" with love much like any parent, Ben, Catherine and Gertz have no ethical qualms with the research. The only other person who has been in their lives continually for the entire experiment is their assistant hired by Gertz, Constantin Samsonov, a defected Russian ex-Olympian in sharpshooting acting much like a nanny in having received formal training in child psychology. But as Ben and Catherine reflect on the past twelve years with the children still knowing nothing about being proverbial guinea pigs, they have to review critically how the experiment turned out in how they present their findings to Gertz, who has a so-called money back guarantee clause built into the contract, and the report which may be tainted by their own isolation over that time.—Huggo"

Slick comedy-drama from the director of The Wedding Singer, with Steve Coogan as an abrasive right-wing radio host whose perfect life is thrown into disarray when his sassy long lost 16-year old niece turns up on his doorstep, ready to challenge everything he stands for. Lionel Macomb is a New York City radio shock jock, his provocative right wing rhetoric which has led to cries that he is making the airwaves toxic, exactly what he wants partly to rile up his faithful angry listeners. His latest target is Senator Judith Montefiore-Salters and her Clean Slate initiative, which is to provide protections to offspring of illegal immigrants. In this era of philosophical wars between the right and left, he is losing listeners to upstart Gareth Whitley, a former protégé who has created his own radio show styled on old fashioned revivalist meetings and thus espouses traditional values, which Gareth arguably only uses as a counterpoint to Lionel and thus in a quest for increased ratings. While he lives a lavish lifestyle afforded by his success, Lionel comes by his views honestly, which is more than what he believes many others can say, in that his success is a result of his own hard work emerging from a difficult growing up in a broken home without any real adult guidance, something only that his inner circle knows. That inner circle includes his publicist and girlfriend Val Gannon, who stands by him despite his flaws, including infidelity, in her belief that she can reform him. Lionel's life is upended when his sixteen year old biracial niece, Tess Macomb, tracks him down, she the daughter of his estranged junkie sister Laurie Macomb, Tess who Lionel had no idea even existed and could not have cared less. Tess has managed to overcome her broken home life to emerge a bright young woman who has a full scholarship to prestigious Harper Academy, she needing a place to live while Laurie has checked herself into rehab, which she only did this time as a deal to Tess a condition of accepting the scholarship. Lionel does take her in largely to avoid any publicity not only about how he would have otherwise treated Tess, a minor, but of any news about his own childhood coming to light. Despite their philosophical differences, liberally-minded Tess and Lionel end up having a profound effect on each other's lives, with Val a moderating influence between the two.—Huggo"

After a shooting at a police funeral, reclusive ex-cop Gannon realizes that the killer belongs to the same militia he joined after quitting the force. Knowing the police will be closing in on them, Gannon quarantines his fellow militiamen in a remote lumber mill. There, he sets about a series of grueling interrogations, intent on ferreting out the killer and turning him over to the authorities to prevent further bloodshed.—danielpacheco214 Gannon, an ex-police officer, is eating a meal one night, when he hears automatic gun shots and explosions in the distance. Listening to a police radio, he hears news that there is a gunman opening fire at a police funeral, and that the suspect has fled on foot. Gannon drives to a secluded warehouse where he meets 6 other members of a local militia of which he is a member. They discover one of the rifles in the armory is missing, as well as body armor and grenades, confirming someone in the group is the gunman. They resolve to stay in the warehouse all night until they can find out which of them carried out the shooting; none of the members will admit. The group's prime suspects are Morris, a former member of the Aryan Brotherhood, and Keating, a young man who never speaks.While Beckmann mans the radio equipment and a fish tracker to see if anyone is approaching the warehouse, Gannon speaks to Noah, who he knows is an undercover officer assigned to the militia, and resolves to keep him safe through the investigation. Gannon first interrogates Morris, who admits to the shooting as revenge for the police covering up the rape and killing of his daughter, but the militia's de facto leader Ford intervenes, telling Gannon that Morris is lying to bring attention to his daughter's murder. Ford suspects Noah, who he threatens to kill if he doesn't admit to the shooting.Beckmann hears over the radio that more militia shootings are taking place, inspired by the initial shooting, and attempts to broadcast that their militia has nothing to do with the shooting, to no avail. Keating finally speaks to Gannon, saying he doesn't speak because he prefers to be alone; Gannon reads from Keating's journal, in which he professes a desire to shoot up his school, and Keating neither confirms or denies that he carried out the shooting. Gannon decides that he needs to die in order to give the police a scapegoat, citing an incident where he was forced to kill his partner in order to maintain his cover and give the police a reason to arrest members of the Ku Klux Klan, but before he can shoot himself, Keating admits to the shooting and confesses over the radio. However, the police believe the confession to be false, mentioning that they've received multiple confessions in the last hour.Ford believes Gannon is protecting Noah, who he feels connected with through their mutual history as police officers, and strings Noah up from a noose in the warehouse. However, the execution is interrupted by the arrival of a squad of police cars. Gannon and Noah both exit the warehouse and surrender to the police, as Gannon tells Ford to tell the police that they both carried out the shooting. The rest of the militia confront the police, armed with rifles and wearing body armor, but as soon as one of them makes a move, the police open fire, killing all of the members except the surrendering Gannon and Noah. Noah then admits that the police faked the shootings to get the militia to distrust each other and give his squad a reason to eliminate the militia. Gannon almost shoots Noah, but relents and gives him his gun, letting him walk away. The police ask Gannon if he wants to rejoin them; the film cuts to black before he decides."
