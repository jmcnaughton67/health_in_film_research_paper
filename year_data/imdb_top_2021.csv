When Peter asks for help from Doctor Strange, the stakes become even more dangerous, forcing him to discover what it truly means to be Spider-Man.—krmanirethnam With his identity compromised, right after the spectacular confrontation with super-hero charlatan Mysterio inSpider-Man: Far from Home (2019), Peter Parker is now with his back to the wall. On the run and having no one to turn to for advice, desperate Peter seeks a radical and equally dangerous solution to right a wrong, utterly unaware of the grave consequences of his ill-advised decision. And, as the unfathomable Multiverse expands with a vengeance, formidable adversaries from a not-so-distant past, too, seek closure, demanding the Spider's head on a platter. But when there's no way home and nowhere to hide, who can Parker trust?—Nick Riganas J. Jonah Jameson of The Daily Bugle has exposed Peter Parker's identity as Spider-Man to the world, while simultaneously framing him as the individual responsible for Mysterio's death and an alleged mass casualty event in London. Numerous civilians nearby begin to surround him and Michelle Jones, forcing them to flee from the media and the police. They hide in Parker's apartment and reunite with May Parker and Happy Hogan, who reveal that they have broken up. Not long after, the United States Department of Damage Control take them along with Ned Leeds in their custody for interrogation. Parker hires Matt Murdock to represent him, who manages to get his criminal charges dropped. However, as Parker, Jones, and Leeds return to Midtown High for their senior year, the intense controversy causes them to be rejected from every college they apply to, including MIT.Parker visits the New York Sanctum and asks Doctor Strange to make the identity of Spider-Man a secret once more to get his friends into MIT. Despite being warned by Wong not to, Strange attempts to cast the spell with the Runes of Kof-Kol. However, Parker incessantly alters the spell when requesting various individuals close to him to be exempt from its effects. As a result, the spell becomes unstable, forcing Strange to contain it. For not consulting with college administrators before meeting with him, Strange furiously kicks Parker out of the Sanctum. Contacting Flash Thompson, who was admitted to MIT, Parker is led to an administrator heading to the Alexander Hamilton Bridge in an attempt to appeal his, Jones' and Leeds' applications.Parker is suddenly ambushed by Doctor Octopus, who seems to know him personally. Doctor Octopus grabs him and rips out a piece of the Iron Spider Armor, transferring its nanites onto his tentacles. He goes for another strike, but Spider-Man reveals his face, which is unfamiliar to Doctor Octopus. Spider-Man then takes control of Doctor Octopus' tentacles with the suit's nanites and rescues the MIT admin from falling off the bridge, who decides to help get him and his friends admitted out of gratitude.Green Goblin arrives and attempts to attack Spider-Man, but he and Doctor Octopus are transported into the Sanctum, where Strange imprisons Doctor Octopus and Lizard. He informs Parker that Doctor Octopus, Lizard, and Green Goblin are not of this universe, but from parallel realities within the Multiverse, who were pulled into this reality by the failed spell since they know Spider-Man's identity. To contain this spell, Strange locks it in the Macchina di Kadavus, a mystical containment unit.Parker is recruited to help find and capture these ""visitors"", receiving a magic-based upgrade to his suit. With assistance from Jones and Leeds, Spider-Man locates Electro outside the city. Startled, he attacks Spider-Man and gains the upper hand, but Sandman intervenes to shield the hero. The two work together to cut the power lines, which fully restores Electro's body. When he is sent to the Sanctum, Sandman believes Spider-Man killed him, but is also captured before he can retaliate. Elsewhere, Norman Osborn attempts to escape from his Green Goblin persona, breaking his mask before fleeing to a F.E.A.S.T. facility seeking refuge. Spider-Man locates Osborn thanks to May and brings him to the Sanctum as well. Osborn, Doctor Octopus, and Electro soon realise that they died and were resurrected by the spell, meaning that if they were to return home then they would perish.Strange explains to Spider-Man that these three are doomed to die fighting their own Spider-Men. He intends to use the Macchina to reverse the spell and send them back to their fates for the sake of the greater Multiverse. Convinced that they can be cured of their antagonistic natures and be spared from death, Spider-Man steals the Macchina before Strange can use it and flees. Strange gives chase, takes Spider-Man's magic back, and sends him into the Mirror Dimension to retrieve the Macchina, while also trying to implore him of the Multiversal stakes relying on the visitors being sent back. Unfazed, Spider-Man entangles Strange in a web matrix and steals his Sling Ring before returning to the Earthly Plane. He passes the ring to Leeds and the Macchina to Jones before releasing the prisoners from confinement.Taking them to Hogan's condominium, Spider-Man attempts to administer cures for the Multiversal refugees. He starts with Doctor Octopus, using a Stark Industries Fabricator to engineer a replacement inhibitor chip for his tentacles and restore his higher brain function. In addition, Electro has an energy siphon installed into him which is designed to extract his powers. But before he could affect Osborn, the Green Goblin persona takes over his body, who persuades Electro to remove the siphon before it can fully take away his abilities. He steals an Arc Reactor and, drawing its power, blasts Octavius out of the building. Lizard, Sandman, and Electro escape, while Green Goblin attacks Spider-Man, sending him to the ground floor. Running outside, May injects an antidote into Green Goblin, which doesn't work. After striking May with his Goblin Glider, Green Goblin tosses two Pumpkin Bombs, which Spider-Man fails to block and explodes in their proximity. Spider-Man manages to locate May in the rubble. Unaware that she had been gravely injured, May tells her nephew not to give up helping others despite all odds, lecturing him that with great power comes great responsibility. As DODC officers surround them, Spider-Man tries to save May, to no avail, as she dies in front of him. Hogan arrives on the scene and is immediately apprehended by authorities.Grief-stricken, Spider-Man flees, his guilt worsening with Jameson's gaslighting coverage of the attack. Growing worrisome after Spider-Man's silence, Jones prepares to activate the Macchina, but Leeds manages to open a portal with the Sling Ring by accident. Attempting to find Spider-Man, they see what seems to be their Spider-Man on the other side of the portal, calling him over. However, they soon realize that this Spider-Man is not theirs, but rather one from another universe that previously fought the Lizard and Electro. Leeds tries again, but summons yet another alternate Peter Parker, who previously fought Green Goblin, Octavius, and Sandman. The group finally manage to find their Spider-Man alone on top of Midtown and attempt to console him about May, but he is too distraught about his mistakes to even care. Before he can use the Macchina to send the Multiversal travellers home, the other two Parkers begin sharing their own personal experiences of loss and bitterness to help him cope and realise that he is not alone.A cheered up Spider-Man then decides to do what he planned to do: heal the villains. The Parkers, Jones, and Leeds then retreat to a classroom laboratory in Midtown to create the cure for the villains. Osborn's Parker engineers an anti-serum for Green Goblin as Electro's Parker recreates the Lizard antidote to return him back to normal, while Spider-Man prepares the cures for Sandman and Electro. Afterwards, Leeds brings them to the Statue of Liberty via portal as he and Jones remain in the lab.Spider-Man calls into The Daily Bugle to broadcast a message, using the Macchina as a lure while announcing his presence to Lizard, Electro, and Sandman. They arrive and attack the three Spider-Men on the scaffolding. The web-slingers are unable to coordinate effectively, which leads them to be easily overpowered by their enemies. Grouping up, Spider-Man assumes command of the trio due to his experience as part of the Avengers; the three adopt code-names: Spider-Man as Peter-One, Osborn's Spider-Man as Peter-Two, and Electro's Spider-Man as Peter-Three. They decide to engage and cure one enemy at a time, with Sandman first. After restraining Lizard, Peter-Three retrieves Sandman's cure and passes the device to Peter-One, who then delivers the cure to Peter-Two, allowing Marko to be neutralised.The three Spider-Men attempt to take the Arc Reactor from Electro, but he proves to be too much of a match for them due to his increased power from the energy source. Lizard breaks free and attacks Jones and Leeds in the lab, forcing Peter-One to leave and fight him. With the help of Leeds and his Sling Ring, Peter-One forces Lizard to break open a bottle containing the antidote which reverts him back to his human form, Curt Connors. Leeds accidentally summons Strange to the battlefield who, upon seeing Connors, realizes Peter-One's pacifist plan is working. Strange grabs back the Macchina and his Sling Ring from Leeds. Peter-Two and Peter-Three are overpowered by Electro, until Octavius arrives to extract the Arc Reactor himself and render him powerless with the finished neutralizer. Peter-Three reconciles with Dillon while Peter-Two warmly reunites with Octavius.Peter-One returns to Strange as he prepares to use the Macchina to send everyone home. Suddenly, Green Goblin ambushes the group and takes the Macchina, but Octavius and Strange grab it back. Unbeknownst to them, Green Goblin had snuck a Pumpkin Bomb inside the object. It detonates and releases the unstable contained spell, tearing the fabric of the universe and opens it up to the Multiverse. The blast also causes Jones to fall from the Statue of Liberty. Peter-One dives to rescue her, but is knocked aside by Green Goblin - Peter-Three saves her, and begins to tear up as it reminded him of the night Gwen Stacy died. As dawn breaks, Peter-One confronts Green Goblin alone. Ravaged with vengeance, he viciously beats him down and attempts to finish him off with his glider, but is stopped by Peter-Two. This however leaves him open to get stabbed in the back by Green Goblin.Peter-Three provides Peter-One with the anti-serum, allowing him to cure Osborn from Green Goblin. He notices Peter-Two's injury, which is non-fatal, and realizes the extent of the damage he had caused. Strange struggles to hold the rifts in the universe together, in which intruders are already preparing to invade this reality. However, Peter-One has him enact a new spell to make everyone forget who he is to fix it. Afterwards, Peter-One embraces his alternate selves, who encourage him to continue on as Spider-Man. Strange repairs the rifts with the new spell and successfully transports Peter-Two, Peter-Three, Dillon, Octavius, Osborn, Marko and Connors back to their origin universes. Spider-Man embraces Leeds and Jones for a final time, while promising to return someday and help them remember him. He then departs as Strange unleashes the spell, leaving the entire world completely oblivious to Parker's existence.A few weeks later, it is now the holidays. Parker tries to reconnect with his MIT-bound friends, but after being reminded of Jones' wounds, he decides not to. He visits May's grave to pay his respects and is joined by Hogan, who is also now a stranger to him. Contending to carry on with his new life, Parker moves into a new apartment alone and begins studying to earn his GED. Alerted to criminal activity on his phone, he stitches together a simpler suit and resumes his heroics undisturbed as Spider-Man, honoring May's mantra of community service and responsibility.In a mid-credits scene: the universe-displaced Eddie Brock and his symbiote companion Venom sit at a bar and talk with the bartender about other super-humans and the Blip. While pondering how to ""protect"" this new world, the duo is swiftly transported back to their universe by Strange's spell, unknowingly leaving a part of the symbiote on the counter."

Eternals,2021,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9032400/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The saga of the Eternals, a race of immortal beings who lived on Earth and shaped its history and civilizations. Following the events ofAvengers: Endgame (2019), an unexpected tragedy forces the Eternals, ancient aliens who have been living on Earth in secret for thousands of years, out of the shadows to reunite against mankind's most ancient enemy, the Deviants. In 5,000 BC in Babylon, earthlings are attacked by the predator Deviants. The humanoid race of powerful Eternals are awaken in their spaceship by their creator Arishem and unleashed to destroy the Deviants with their abilities. However, they are not authorized to return to their ship and have to stay living on Earth along the centuries. On the present days, in London, the eternal Sersi is walking near the river with her earthling boyfriend Dane Whitman and her friend and also eternal Sprite when they are attacked by a Deviant. Soon the Eternals join themselves to fight the predator race that is more powerful now and they learn dreadful secrets about Arishem and their origins while fighting the predators.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil In 5000 B.C., a group of ten immortal individuals descend upon Earth to protect humanity from the Deviants. They are the Eternals, who have been sent from their home planet of Olympia on the Domo by the Prime Celestial: Arishem the Judge. Throughout the centuries, the Eternals continue to relocate to other growing civilizations and defend them from the Deviants, although they are barred by Arishem from interfering with human conflicts to allow them to evolve naturally. Two Eternals, Sersi and Ikaris, would develop a close relationship over the centuries, eventually becoming a married couple.In 1521, the Spanish invasion on the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan runs concurrently with an attack from the last of the Deviants. While fighting them off, Thena's Mahd Wy'ry causes her to momentarily turn on her allies, only to be stopped by Gilgamesh. The Prime Eternal, Ajak, offers to cure Thena's affliction at the cost of her memories, but Gilgamesh volunteers to look over her, conceding with the possibility that she may have to be killed if she turns again. Druig, frustrated with how the Eternals have been abstaining from human affairs, deserts them to end the Spanish conflict himself. With the Deviants seemingly eradicated, Ajak releases the Eternals to go their own ways. In the years since, Ikaris would abandon Sersi as the other Eternals await their return to Olympia.In the present day, Sprite lives with Sersi in London as she works as a museum curator with a romantic interest in her colleague Dane Whitman. One night, Sersi, Sprite and Whitman are leaving a party when they are attacked by a Deviant. They are joined by Ikaris as they fight to eradicate the beast, but they discover that it is able to heal itself. As Whitman is left behind, Sersi, Sprite and Ikaris decide to leave for South Dakota in search of Ajak. At her house, they find her body instead, a victim of an earlier Deviant attack. As Sersi mourns over the cadaver of their leader, Ajak passes on the sphere she uses to communicate with Arishem to her. With the Deviant threat looming, the three decide to venture out to find the other Eternals.They approach Kingo as he shoots a new Bollywood film, who is hesitant to leave his life of stardom and rejoin the Eternals. He gives in when he learns about Ajak, alongside additional encouragement from his valet Karun Patel, who also tags alongside them to film a documentary for Kingo. The group locates Gilgamesh and Thena in Australia as the latter's Wy'ry resurfaces due to a recent Deviant attack. After examining Thena's artwork she had painted during her episodes of Wy'ry, which visualized memories of planetary destructions in the past, Sersi uses the sphere to successfully establish a connection to Arishem. The Prime Celestial reveals to Sersi that Olympia does not actually exist- instead, he had engineered the Eternals in the World Forge. He had also created the Deviants to eradicate Earth's apex predators and allow intelligent life to thrive, but a critical design flaw led them to evolve and become predators themselves.So, the Eternals were deployed onto Earth to protect the humans, unaware that they were also defending a seed that would spawn the new Celestial Tiamut the Communicator once the population quota of intelligent life was achieved. When that happens, the Emergence would commence, resulting in the destruction of the planet and the birth of said Celestial, which would allow for new life and galaxies to form. Afterwards, the memories of the Eternals would be taken from them and studied by Arishem to make way for their next planetary mission. Appalled with the true meaning of their existence, Sersi informs the others. Together, they realize that Thena's mental affliction was the result of a botched memory wipe after a previous Emergence.Hoping to delay the Emergence, they find Druig in an Amazon village in hopes that he could be able utilize his telepathy to render Tiamut the Communicator dormant, but he is hesitant to help them. At night, they are ambushed by the Deviants and fight to fend them off. Ikaris and Sersi are viciously attacked by one of the beasts, but she uses her powers to transmute it into a tree, to everyone's surprise. As Thena begins to fall insane yet again, Gilgamesh rushes to her side. However, this allows the Deviant leader Kro to attack him and absorb his powers, gaining a humanoid figure, intelligible speech, and his memories.Before fleeing, Kro pledges to kill the Eternals for their actions towards the Deviants. With his last words, Gilgamesh successfully gets Thena to remember who she is, curing her of the affliction. The rest of the Eternals mourn the loss of their strongest fighter with a cremation, with Thena scattering his ashes in the river. Druig proclaims that he is not powerful enough to affect a Celestial, so they head to Chicago to seek out Phastos, who had long abandoned mankind and his technological ambitions after his technology was used to create the atomic bomb. However, he has newfound hope for humanity after finding a new life with his husband Ben Stoss and son Jack Stoss. He initially refuses to leave his family, but relents after Ben convinces him to fight for Jack's future.Heading to Iraq, they retrieve the Domo from an archaeological site and find Makkari residing in the ship. As they all are imbued with infinite cosmic energy, Phastos proposes they channel their energy into Druig and form a Uni-Mind so that he can take control of the Celestial and stop the Emergence. But not everyone is onboard with the plan, with Ikaris being the primary dissident. When Kingo pledges to remain alongside Ikaris up until the end, he recalls his last encounter with Ajak six days prior. She informs Ikaris that although the Blip brought the Emergence closer to reality, the heroics of the Avengers inspired her to doubt Arishem for the first time. But as he remains a firm believer in Arishem, Ikaris takes Ajak to a town in Alaska, where the Deviants trapped in ice were resurfacing due to global warming associated with the Emergence. He pushes her into the path of Kro, who absorbs her life force and gains her hyper-regenerative powers. Ikaris takes Ajak's body back home before breaking down over what he had done.Sersi senses the commencement of the Emergence, prompting Phastos to send Makkari out and find Tiamut, who is at a volcanic island in the Indian Ocean. Druig deduces Ikaris' role in Ajak's death, and Sersi learns he was made aware of their true mission by Ajak centuries ago. Ikaris argues that it is their duty as Eternals to protect the Celestial cycle of life so that the universe may continue to exist. When Kingo threatens to attack Ikaris, Sprite decides to leave with him. As he does not want to face Arishem but wishes not to fight his friends, Kingo also departs along with Karun. Thena convinces Sersi to continue Ajak's mission as her successor and prevent the Emergence from eliminating all of mankind. To facilitate the Uni-Mind, Phastos takes Sersi's communication sphere and disassembles it to construct bracelets for the other Eternals to wear.At the island, Sersi, Thena and Makkari lend their energy to Druig and allow him to connect with Tiamut, but Ikaris blasts him into a hole and destroys the Domo. Determining that Sersi's matter transmutation powers are their last chance to stop the Emergence, Makkari, Thena and Phastos confront Ikaris to give her cover. Kro attacks the Eternals and nearly kills Makkari, but Phastos knocks him into a cave where Thena follows him into. Sprite projects an illusion of Ajak to distract Sersi before stabbing her with a dagger. As she is constantly mocked for her childlike stature, Sprite envies Sersi for being able to live a full life among humans, hoping that the Emergence's aftermath would allow her to be reborn as a full-sized lifeform. Druig recovers and knocks Sprite out, but he is unable to utilize his powers against Tiamut again, forcing Sersi to face it alone as the Celestial begins to rise from Earth's crust.Kro impersonates Gilgamesh and attempts to take over Thena's mind, but she is able to resist him and kills the Deviant. Phastos manages to restrain Ikaris and prevent him from using his powers momentarily, but he eventually breaks free and flies away to stop Sersi. However, he is emotionally unable to bring himself to harm her. Remembering their time on Earth and the love they shared, he surrenders. Despite this, Sersi still doesn't have enough energy to kill Tiamut, however, suddenly something unites all the Eternals - including Ikaris and Sprite - into the Uni-Mind, attaining enough energy to allow Sersi to transform Tiamut's body into marble. Guilt-ridden, Ikaris apologizes to Sersi before fleeing Earth, flying directly into the Sun. Phastos deduces that it was Tiamut itself that initiated the Uni-Mind - this was always the way for Eternals to survive destructions of planets, but this time it resulted in the Celestial's death. Having retained some energy from the Uni-Mind, Sersi fulfills Sprite's wishes and transmutes her into a human to allow her to grow up.Two weeks later in South Dakota, Thena, Makkari and Druig depart for space on the Domo, which had been repaired by Phastos, in search for more Eternals and tell them the truth. Back in London, Sprite bids goodbye to Sersi as she moves out with Kingo to attend school. Whitman professes his love for her and is about to reveal a secret regarding his family history, when suddenly Arishem appears outside Earth's orbit and lifts Sersi, Kingo and Phastos into space. Displeased with their treason, Arishem says he will spare humanity if the Eternals' memories show that the humans are worthy of living. He vows to return for judgement, before taking the trio with him into a singularity.In a mid-credits scene: Thena, Makkari and Druig meet the Eternal Eros, Thanos' brother and his assistant Pip the Troll, who offer their help.In a post-credits scene: Whitman opens a case containing the legendary Ebony Blade when an unseen person questions whether he is ready for it."

Ghostbusters: Afterlife,2021,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4513678/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"When a single mom and her two kids arrive in a small town, they begin to discover their connection to the original Ghostbusters and the secret legacy their grandfather left behind. Running out of options and money, single mum Callie sets foot in the small town of Summerville, Oklahoma, with her two teenage children, Phoebe and Trevor. And now, there is no turning back. As the family attempts to settle in the dilapidated house of Callie's eccentric late father, unexpected secrets hidden in plain sight, mysterious equipment, and a strange vehicle rotting in the barn seem to relate to the area's puzzling seismic activity, and something even more shocking: the long-forgotten Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man Incident in 1980s New York City. But there hasn't been a single ghost sighting since the bizarre events ofGhostbusters II (1989). Is history repeating itself? Will Phoebe connect the dots, give her grandfather a voice, and discover the family's connection to the originalGhostbusters (1984)?—Nick Riganas In the pre-title sequence, a proton blast shoots out the top of a mine shaft at the Shandor Mining Company and into a swirling vortex of clouds under a midnight sky. Then an old pickup truck comes hauling out of the mine shaft and down a desolate rural road. The driver is a bearded elderly man (Oliver Cooper) obscured in the darkness of his truck's cabin. He looks down at the passenger seat and touches a ghost trap that's holding a spirit. His truck is being chased by an unseen creature that is eventually able to sideswipe the vehicle and send it crashing into a cornfield. The man stumbles out into an open field in front of an old farm house. He gets to the porch and turns around and holds up the trap baiting the unseen spirit in the corn field. The old man is Egon Spengler and he readies a foot pedal switch as invisible steps are seen advancing in the dirt across the field. When it is in position, Egon stomps the pedal and several electric towers begin to activate. But they short out before powering on the device they were intended for and Egon quickly goes inside and shuts the door. He hides the trap in a compartment under the wood floor and then sits in a chair with his PKE meter. As fog fills the room, his PKE begins to light up and it's arms extend reminiscent of when a ghost is present. Egon is attacked in his chair and the PKE meter falls to the floor and turns off. A spirit orb is seen leaving the house from outside. Back in the house, the PKE meter activates again eluding to a new ghost nearby.We meet Callie (Carrie Coon) and her kids Trevor (Finn Wolfhard) and Phoebe (Mckenna Grace) as they are getting evicted from their apartment. Callie gets notice that her father has passed away in his farmhouse in Oklahoma and takes the kids with her to collect anything of value including the home. They find a dilapidated house full of clutter. As they're looking around, Janine (the Ghostbusters' receptionist) walks in and tells them that Callie's dad (Egon) had a lot of debt and a valueless farm. The ground begins to shake in what appears to be tremors from an earthquake, and the family huddle under a table. Phoebe spots the PKE meter under the chair her grandfather was in when he died.Callie takes Trevor and Phoebe into town to eat after she admits to them that they will be staying there for a while until she can figure out what to do. They find that it's a very small southern town where everyone knew of the mysterious man they all called ""the dirt farmer"" since there was no evidence he ever grew any crops. Trevor applies to work at the burger joint because he is smitten with the girl who works there named Lucky (Celeste O'Connor).In the following days Phoebe begins exploring the farm while using the PKE meter. She notices a chess board with an initial move made so she makes a move from her side of the board. Callie starts Phoebe in summer school and meets her teacher Gary (Paul Rudd) as she drops her off. Gary is just there to collect a paycheck and has the kids watch VHS's of old horror movies (the first one beingCujo (1983)) while he sits in the back doing research on the ongoing tremors in the area. Phoebe impresses him with her knowledge on Seismology and he explains to her that the tremor wave patterns don't match up with typical earthquakes from history. Phoebe also meets a boy in her class who calls himself ""Podcast"" (Logan Kim) since he's always recording for his show with his microphone.Back at the farmhouse, Phoebe sees that another move is made on the chess board and begins playing the ghost as the chess pieces begin moving in front of her. The ghost leads her downstairs by turning on lights until she finds the ghost trap under a floor panel. She takes it to Gary where he explains what it is based on his knowledge of the famed New York siege from 1984. He shows her and Podcast old footage of the Ghostbusters commercial on YouTube. They rig the trap to a school bus battery to get it to open. They succeed and a ghost resembling one of the demon dogs from the original flies away.Revelations come to fruition as Trevor finds Ecto-1 in the barn under a tarp and Phoebe finds Egon's lab in the basement. They both realize that their grandfather was a Ghostbuster and begin to take matters into their own hands. Phoebe repairs a proton blaster with help from Egon's invisible ghost and takes it out for a test with Podcast tagging along. Upon firing it, they hear a rustling in a nearby warehouse. They find the metal eating ghost named Muncher. They attempt to wrangle and capture him but fail. Meanwhile, Trevor repairs Ecto-1 and takes it for a joy ride where he comes upon Phoebe and Podcast who tell him what they were doing. The trio take off to capture Muncher in Ecto-1. They chase him thru the city and destroy tons of property with the proton gun. They succeed in capturing it with Egon's RC car mounted ghost trap. All the chaos alerted the police and they are subsequently pulled over and put in the town's holding cell. During their time at the jailhouse, Phoebe uses her ""one phone call"" option to call the number of the Ghostbusters from the commercial. Ray Stantz answers and explains that the team broke up after they had ostensibly eliminated all the ghosts. He and Egon had a falling out after Egon stole all their equipment claiming Gozer could still bring the end of the world. Phoebe tells him that Egon was killed a week ago before she is abruptly cut off by the sheriff claiming her phone time is up. Callie and Gary -who were out on a date during all of this- show up and bail them out.Phoebe confronts her mom for not telling her who their grandfather really was. Callie counters with the history she had with her dad. She wasn't into science like he was and felt like they never bonded and he didn't care about her. That's why he left them and became a recluse on the Oklahoma farm she concluded.The kids -feeling there's got to be a reason their grandfather would sacrifice everything to live on a farm in the middle of nowhere- find in his lab that his ""dirt farm"" was actually a field of hundreds of ghost traps meant to capture Gozer. They realize that his trap must have failed and set off to investigate the mine shaft once more. By this time Lucky has become close with Trevor thru work and the discovery that she is the sheriff's daughter. So she tags along to the mine with Trevor, Phoebe, and Podcast. They discover the root of all the tremors is the fact that the mine is actually a portal to the evil dead and every time Gozer attempts to raise the hoard of ghosts -along with the twin demon dogs- a series of 4 seismic activated proton guns that Egon rigged up inside turn on. They automatically cross beams and suppress the constant attempts of the ghosts trying to escape. This was the source of the recurrent tremors everyone in town was experiencing and holding Gozer back was the insurmountable task Egon had taken on alone since no one else believes him.That same night, Gary goes to Walmart to pick up some ice cream after his unusual date with Callie. He discovers several mini StayPuft marshmallow men roaming the store causing chaos like a bunch of gremlins. He comes upon the demon dog he released earlier and gets chased out to his car and attacked just like the scene from Cujo. Back at the farmhouse, Callie finds the hidden lab and discovers that her father Egon had a memory board of all her life on the wall. Just as she realizes that he truly cared about her, the other demon dog finds her in the lab and possesses her.The kids come home to reveal their discovery to Callie but find her possessed, before she jumps out the window and runs off towards the mine shaft. She finds Gary, who has already allowed the ghosts to start escaping by damaging the auto-proton guns that were keeping them at bay. The two ""merge energies"" in the mine. The kids retrieve Ecto-1 from the police impound with Lucky's help. Phoebe and Podcast are able to get the RC ghost trap and proton blaster out from the weapon holding cell by reaching in and releasing Muncher who immediately eats away the bars and escapes.They arrive at the mine and witness Callie and Gary transforming into the demon dog forms with Gozer sitting between them. Phoebe steps out from hiding to talk to and distract Gozer while Podcast controls the RC trap and captures the demon dog possessing Callie. This releases her from dog form as she passes out. The kids escape in Ecto-1 with Callie as the Gary -still possessed in dog form- chases after them.They make their way to the farmhouse and attempt the same trap as Egon. Callie and Phoebe stand on the porch holding the ghost trap with the demon dog that Gozer needs to become fully resurrected. Gozer appears out of the corn field and Phoebe tries to turn on the traps but they fail again just as they had the first time with Egon. Some mini StayPuft marshmallow men sabotage the equipment inside Ecto-1, which allows Gozer to release the demon dog from the ghost trap. The freed dog possesses Lucky. Just as Gozer, now back to full strength, is about to kill Phoebe, she is hit with a proton blast from behind. It's Ray Stantz who had just arrived with Peter Venkman and Winston Zeddemore! The three original Ghostbusters cross the beams and fire at Gozer. She appears subdued but then begins uncrossing the beams and blasts the Ghostbusters back causing them all to fall down. Gozer approaches them as Peter jokingly complains about the inherent troubles in their relationship. Just as she reaches them she is again captured by a sole proton beam. This time it's Phoebe, whose aim is being guided by the ghost of Egon. This is the first time his image is revealed to the audience.The other three Ghostbusters jump up and join the battle by firing their beams as well. With the combined force of four beams once again, Gozer is suppressed but not captured. Meanwhile, Trevor and Podcast have been able to defeat the mini-Pufts and repair the sabotaged equipment, allowing Trevor to emerge from Ecto-1 and fire his proton beam at the electrical capacitors. The burst of energy charges them up. Callie throws the switch to try to turn the traps on again, and this time they successfully activate, capturing Gozer and the demon dogs.The other three original Ghostbusters stare in amazement at the sight of the ghost form of their fallen comrade. They watch as he says goodbye, fixes Phoebe's glasses -identical to his- and gives Callie a hug. Having reconciled with his family, Egon's form fades and dissipates into the night sky. Lucky and Gary break free of the frozen dog carcasses, and the three surviving original Ghostbusters become acquainted with the Spenglers, before Winston tells them that he will fix up Ecto-1, and the three original Ghostbusters take it and their equipment back to New York City. We see an overhead shot of Ecto-1 driving with emergency lights on across a bridge in New York City as the theme song ""Ghostbusters"" begins.There is a mid-credits scene where Dana Barrett Venkman (Sigourney Weaver) tests Peter Venkman's psychic powers with the same patterned cards and electro-shock machine Peter had used in his University research before he became a Ghostbuster, and a post-credits scene shows a brief conversation between Winston, who is now the wealthy head of his family, and Janine, in which Winston mentions that he has been using his resources to maintain the Ghostbusters' properties, including Ray's Occult Bookstore and the fire station that had originally served as the Ghostbusters' headquarters. This is followed by Winston opening the fire station's door to allow Ecto-1 to be driven back inside, after which we see a shot of the basement's containment system with a blinking red light."
Free Guy,2021,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6264654/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"When Guy, a bank teller, learns that he is a non-player character in a bloodthirsty, open-world video game, he goes on to become the hero of the story and takes the responsibility of saving the world. In the extremely popular video game, Free City, a NPC named Guy learns the true nature of his existence when he meets the girl of his dreams, a human player. This player's interactions with Guy has massive affects on him, the game, and real world as they play it. Brimming with optimism and positive energy, single bank teller Guy has spent nearly all his uneventful life wishing he were one of the cool people wearing sunglasses--people who run his town. But, one day, Guy has a chance encounter with mysterious Millie, the woman of his dreams, and just like that, he's on the brink of making an eye-opening, life-altering discovery. Now, to win her heart, all that Guy has to do is take control of his life, one step at a time. And then, out of the blue, Millie decides to drop a bombshell. However, is she telling the truth? Above all, if life is nothing but a game, what will it take for ordinary Guy to level up and get the girl?—Nick Riganas Free City is an online, open-world video game developed by Soonami Games. Its source code was stolen from an unreleased game called Life Itself, developed by Walter ""Keys"" McKey and Millie Rusk, and used by Soonami's head developer Antwan Hovachelik to create Free City. Keys has since taken a job at Soonami, while Millie spends time within Free City as her avatar Molotov Girl to find evidence of code that she and Keys had written and to prove that they are the rightful owners of the code.In the game, Guy, a non-player character (NPC), works as a bank teller and spends time with his best friend and co-worker, bank security guard Buddy, unaware that his world is a video game. One day, he encounters Molotov Girl, who is singing the song that he says his dream girl will like and begins to deviate from his programming. He takes a pair of sunglasses from a player who tries to rob his bank, through which he sees Free City from the player's head-up display (HUD). Guy speaks to Millie, who initially thinks he is another player named ""Blue Shirt Guy"" and not an NPC. She tells him to level up to above 100 before she will speak to him again. Keys and his coworker Mouser believe Guy to be a hacker disguised as an NPC and unsuccessfully attempt to ban him from the game. Rather than leveling up through destructive acts, Guy opts to perform good deeds, completing missions within Free City to reach level 102. His virtuous progression, which stands out from those of other players, results in ""Blue Shirt Guy"" becoming a worldwide sensation.Millie and Guy meet again when she breaks into the Stash, another player's well-protected compound that holds evidence of her source code. Guy helps Millie escape the Stash, and Millie is bewildered when Guy wants to kiss her. Keys realizes that Guy is truly an NPC, and that his self-awareness came about from artificial intelligence (AI) code containing Millie's personal preferences that Keys had included in Life Itself, which in turn had led Guy to develop a romantic interest in Millie. In addition, Guy's subsequent interactions with other NPCs have led them to develop self-awareness as well. Keys decides to help Millie retrieve their code before Free City is wiped from Soonami's servers to make way for its sequel, Free City 2, in two days. When Millie tells Guy the truth of his situation, Guy breaks off their relationship, telling her that he is in love with her. However, after talking with Buddy about the situation, Guy realizes that there was something more than love in their relationship and gains full sentience. Guy returns to Millie and agrees to help.Guy breaks into the Stash again with Buddy's help, where its owner, recognizing Guy, hands over the evidence. Guy's continued popularity threatens the launch of Free City 2, and Antwan orders Keys and Mouser to reboot the entire game, but Keys refuses and Antwan reboots the game himself.In the game, Millie finds Guy without any memories of his sentience, but recalling Keys' advice that Guy would need a reminder, she kisses him. Guy's sentience is restored, and he recalls the location of the Island, part of Life Itself that will not be protected from the pending data wipe and which is the only proof of Millie and Keys' original code. Antwan then tries to directly eliminate Guy and Molotov Girl from the game by raising their ""wanted level"" to maximum, but as Guy and Millie have persuaded the other NPCs in the game that they are more than their programming, they no longer respond to outside commands and refuse to interfere. Antwan then resorts to directly manipulating the game topography to kill Guy and Molotov Girl, while Keys makes his own changes to protect and direct them to the Island, broadcasting the effort to all of the Free City players who had been ejected from the game. Antwan fires Keys and then sends Dude, a muscular, unfinished copy of Guy developed for Free City 2, into the game. Unable to defeat him in direct combat, Guy puts his sunglasses onto Dude, the HUD distracting the far-less mature AI indefinitely.Antwan then enters Soonami's server room and begins destroying the game's servers with a fire axe in a last-ditch attempt to prevent his theft from being revealed, leading Mouser to discover Antwan's crimes and get fired, but Guy makes it to the Island before he can destroy the last one, an event that is seen by gamers all over the world. With the theft revealed, Antwan holds the remaining server hostage and demands that Millie abandon her lawsuit and surrender the Free City intellectual property (IP), along with the profits from the game. Millie, believing the real value of the game is in its programming, enthusiastically agrees; the game's inhabitants are saved.Without Millie and Keys' code, Free City 2 is a catastrophic failure at launch, Antwan is vilified by the media for his now-exposed crimes and he is arrested for theft and criminal damage. Keys, Mouser, and Millie start a successful new company with the recovered code to release Free Life, bringing Guy, Buddy, Dude, and the other Free City NPCs into it. Thanks to Guy, Millie realizes that Keys' code was in fact a love letter to her, and they embrace and kiss. Guy reunites with Buddy, and they begin to live their own lives in Free Life without having to follow their original Free City coding."
Jungle Cruise,2021,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0870154/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Based on Disneyland's theme park ride where a small riverboat takes a group of travelers through a jungle filled with dangerous animals and reptiles but with a supernatural element. 1916. Dreaming about saving countless lives and having another adventure, the feisty English feminist and doctor of botany, Dr Lily Houghton, embarks on a peril-laden mission to change the world. Along with her fashionable brother, MacGregor, Dr Houghton enlists the help of the arrogant, wisecracking riverboat skipper, Captain Frank Wolff, to guide them through the serpentine Amazon River in La Quila, his swift wooden boat. Now, as the intrepid trio ventures deeper and deeper into the heart of an impenetrable green maze, searching for something that cannot be found, a centuries-old curse and the ruthless aristocrat, Prince Joachim, threaten to put an end to their ambitious plans. And, sooner or later, the jungle always wins. Is it true that the Spanish conquistador, Don Aguirre, was lost in the same God-forsaken part of the world?—Nick Riganas In the 16th century, Spanish conquistadors travel to South America in search of the Tears of the Moon, a mythical tree whose petals can cure any illness, heal any injury, and lift any curse. After most of the men die in the jungle, the survivors are nursed back to health by a local tribe using the tree petals. When they refuse to reveal the location of the tree, the Spanish destroy the village, and as punishment are cursed to never die and never be able to leave sight of the river.In 1916, Dr. Lily Houghton and her brother MacGregor detail Lily's research on the Tears of the Moon to an association of English explorers, explaining that the petals could revitalize medicine and aid in the war effort. The Houghton's request access to an arrowhead recovered by Dr. Albert Falls that Lily believes is key to locating the tree. When the association denies their request, believing the tree to be a myth and a female scientist unqualified to join their ranks, Lily steals the arrowhead instead. She narrowly avoids Prince Joachim, a German aristocrat who also wants the arrowhead and the tree.In South America, Frank Wolff takes tourists on jungle river cruises, which he embellishes with fake dangers and corny jokes. When his boat engine is repossessed by businessman Nilo, he attempts to steal it back. Caught in the act by Lily, Frank pretends to be Nilo and arrogantly tells her that the Tears of the Moon is a myth and that she will not be able to handle the dangers of the jungle, but changes his tone when he notices that Lily is in possession of the arrowhead. Frank's deception is revealed with the real Nilo shows up, but Lily hires Frank anyway after he underbids Nilo and bravely fights off a wild jaguar attack.Frank, Lily, and MacGregor depart on Frank's boat but are almost intercepted by Nilo attempting to get his engine back, mercenaries hired by Joachim to retrieve the arrowhead from Lily, and Joachim himself attacking in a German submarine. After they make their mistake, it is revealed that the attacking jaguar was actually Frank's pet Proxima, and Lily wonders if Frank can be trusted.Joachim locates the cursed conquistadors, whose bodies have turned to stone due to them traveling too far from the river, and have been infested over time by tree roots, snakes, and insects. Joachim frees them by diverting the river, and offers to help them break the curse if they help him to retrieve the arrowhead.As Frank, Lily and MacGregor continue down the river they become closer. MacGregor reveals to Frank that he was nearly disowned by his family due to his homosexuality, but Lily stood by him. Breaking into Frank's cabin, Lily finds photos and drawings of new inventions such as the automobile, but also discovers drawings of the arrowhead and research on the Tears of the Moon. Lily accuses Frank of wanting the tree for himself, but he explains he gave up searching for it a long time ago and believed it couldn't be found. They are attacked by a tribe of ""cannibals"" who demand the arrowhead, but this is revealed to be another deception by Frank working with a friendly tribe. Frank apologizes and says he was unable to call off the plan, but Lily rebuffs him. Trader Sam, the tribe's female leader, translates the writing on the arrowhead, revealing the location of the tree, and that it only blooms under a blood moon. The conquistadors attack and manage to take the arrowhead; Frank recovers it and gives it to Lily but is stabbed through the chest with a sword and falls to his death. Lily runs away from the river so that the Spaniards cannot follow her.The next morning, Lily discovers that Frank has miraculously survived. He reveals that his real name is Francisco, and he is actually one of the cursed conquistadors, unable to die or leave the river. The expedition to find the tree was originally a noble one to save the leader's sick daughter, but when the natives were attacked by the Spaniards, Frank switched sides to help the villagers. After years of fighting, Frank trapped the others in a cave away from the river. He then spent time searching for the tree to lift his own curse, but had been unable to find it without the arrowhead.An injured MacGregor stays behind with Trader Sam while Lily and Frank make the final journey to the tree. MacGregor is captured by Joachim and forced to reveal the location of the tree. Frank, Lily, the Germans, and the Spaniards all converge on the tree, which begins to bloom under the blood moon. The moon passes quickly as they fight, and Lily is only able to recover one petal. MacGregor kills Joachim, and Frank crashes his boat to block the river, turning himself and the other Spaniards into stone. Lily uses the petal to revive Frank and break the curse, only afterwords discovering that due to a shift in the moonlight there is one petal left for Lily's research.Back in London, the society has offered full membership to Lily, which she rejects. She shows Frank London and gives him his first driving lesson in her automobile as well as delivering a corny joke herself."
Dune,2021,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1160419/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A noble family becomes embroiled in a war for control over the galaxy's most valuable asset while its heir becomes troubled by visions of a dark future. A mythic and emotionally charged hero's journey, ""Dune"" tells the story of Paul Atreides, a brilliant and gifted young man born into a great destiny beyond his understanding, who must travel to the most dangerous planet in the universe to ensure the future of his family and his people. As malevolent forces explode into conflict over the planet's exclusive supply of the most precious resource in existence-a commodity capable of unlocking humanity's greatest potential-only those who can conquer their fear will survive.—Warner Bros. In the far future of humanity, Duke Leto Atreides accepts stewardship of the dangerous desert planet Arrakis, the only source of the most valuable substance in the universe, ""the spice"", a drug which extends human life and provides accelerated levels of thought. Year 10191. Summoned by the emperor to take over the stewardship of the arid, inhospitable planet Arrakis--the only source of Spice, the sacred hallucinogen--Duke Leto of the noble House Atreides and his family travel to the peril-laden exoplanet. But there, beset by indecipherable visions, the duke's gifted son, Paul Atreides, finds himself caught between two worlds as the grotesque Baron Vladimir of the brutal House Harkonnen plots revenge. Now, the road to legend leads deep into the desert. Can Paul fulfil his destiny in far-off Dune, the home of the mysterious, blue-eyed Fremen?—Nick Riganas The story opens with a woman telling a portion of her people's history on the desert planet, Arrakis. The woman, Chani, is a Fremen. She explains that since before she was born the planet has been ruled by the cruel Harkonnens who have grown enormously rich harvesting the psychogenic substance ""melange"" also known as the spice. The Fremen have been trying to expel the Harkonnens, but to no avail. Recently, however, the Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV has ordered the Harkonnens to leave Arrakis. Chani wonders who the new rulers will be.On the planet Caladan, Paul Atreides eats breakfast with his mother, Lady Jessica, Duke Leto's concubine. A member of the quasi-religious order of the Bene Gesserit, Jessica has been trying to teach her son the special powers of her order. She tests Paul by having him try to compel her to pass him a glass of water. Paul is only partially successful. Paul learns about the planet Arrakis and its people. It is the only source of the psychoactive spice, which extends life and perception. Spice is necessary for interstellar travel since it makes possible the expanded consciousness of the navigators who plot faster than light jumps, ""folding"" space time to travel instantly from one planet to another.Leto Atreides, along with soldier Gurney Halleck and mentat Thufir Hawat, receive an imperial envoy who formalizes the awarding of Arrakis to House Atreides. The emperor fears Leto's growing political power and popularity in the Landsraad, a conclave of noble houses. Leto recognizes that his appointment to oversee Arrakis is a trap of some kind, but cannot refuse an imperial offer. Paul asks his friend, the elite soldier Duncan Idaho to take him along when Duncan goes to Arrakis weeks ahead of time to scout things out. Duncan refuses. Paul confides that he's been having dreams about Arrakis and the Fremen, including one where Duncan falls in battle. Duncan dismisses this as merely a dream, telling Paul that ""Everything important happens when we're awake"".Paul discusses his wish to travel to Arrakis early with his father, but Leto refuses, saying that he needs Paul by his side. He explains the political situation: the emperor has set up a conflict between House Atreides and House Harkonnen, a war which will weaken them both, to the benefit of the Emperor. Leto instead intends to strike an alliance with the Fremen in order to harness their ""desert power"" to his own and outwit the Emperor. Paul expresses his doubts about his ability to succeed his father as a leader. Leto confides his own doubts when he was young and insists that Paul will find his way to leadership, just as he did.Gurney has a sparring session with Paul, insisting that the young ducal heir must be more wary about the danger posed by the Harkonnens and more ruthless in battle. Paul begins to have dreams of Chani. Jessica's Bene Gesserit superior, Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam arrives on Caladan to test Paul. Before the meeting he is inspected by Suk doctor Wellington Yueh, who warns Paul that the Bene Gesserit have their own agenda. Mohiam puts Paul through the test of the Gom Jabbar, using a poisoned needle and a pain-inflicting box to judge his character. After the test, Mohiam asks Paul about his dreams and whether they sometimes come true. Afterward, Mohiam berates Jessica for producing a son for Duke Leto, rather than the daughters she had been ordered to produce.She accuses Jessica of thinking that her son might be the Kwisatz Haderach, the fulfillment of a Bene Gesserit messianic prophecy. Jessica confirms this belief and Mohiam warns her that Paul's abilities are not fully developed and that he might die in the coming trials. When Mohiam leaves, Paul confronts his mother about what Mohiam meant. Jessica explains that the Bene Gesserit have spent hundreds of years engaged in a selective breeding program to produce an unparalleled mind who can see both the past and the future.The Atreides arrive on Arrakis. When they disembark their ship, locals begin chanting a phrase Paul cannot recognize. Paul asks his mother and she explains that it's a local prophecy of the Lisan-al-Gaib, the ""voice from outer world"", a prophesied messiah on Arrakis. Jessica says that they think Paul might be this figure, but Paul dismisses it as mere superstition spread by the Bene Gesserit. Jessica hires a Fremen servant, Shadout Mapes. Mapes sees Jessica and Paul as a fulfillment of the Lisan-al-Gaib and gives Jessica a dagger made from the tooth of Shai-halud, the immense sandworms which make the desert of Arrakis so dangerous. That night, while he studies a holographic image of the muad'Dib desert mouse, Paul survives an assassination attempt by a hunter seeker drone when Mapes enters the room, distracting it.Leto surveys his new domain and discovers that the Harkonnens have sabotaged much of the needed infrastructure. They decide to take the issue to the imperial arbiter of the transition, an ecologist named Liet Kynes, who has resided on Arrakis for years. Duncan Idaho returns from several weeks living with the Fremen. He reports to the Duke that the Fremen are unparalleled fighters who live in communities known as ""sietchs"" in caverns beneath the desert. Duncan confirms Thufir Hawat's belief that there are many more Fremen than previously believed. The leader of one of these sietchs, Stilgar, has come to meet with Leto. Stilgar demands that the outworlders not travel beyond the city except to mine spice. Leto refuses but insists that the sietchs will remain inviolate and that Fremen will not be hunted while the Atreides rule. Paul invites Stilgar to stay, but he leaves. Duncan introduces the Atreides to some Fremen technology, including the moisture saving stillsuits and thumpers which are used to attract sandworms.Leto's party meets with Liet Kynes to investigate the spice mining operations. She inspects their stillsuits and finds that Paul has intuitively fitted his stillsuit in the Fremen manner. In the native language she says ""He shall know your ways as if born to them"". The party flies out to observe a spice mining operation. The mining vehicle -- a ""sandcrawler"" -- has attracted a worm, which is drawn by the rhythmic vibrations of the crawler as it collects the spice. When a flying carry-all fails to remove the mining vehicle, Duke Leto lands his small squad of ornithopters nearby to rescue the miners. When Paul gets out to guide the miners inside, he is hit with a massive dose of spice and has a series of visions including one of himself with Chani. He is nearly sucked down into the sand with the crawler when Gurney grabs him and hauls him aboard his father's ornithopter. The two watch as the worm's enormous, toothed maw opens and swallows the sandcrawler whole. Later, Paul is examined by Dr Yueh who informs Paul and his mother that the spice is psychoactive but shouldn't harm Paul.Duke Leto awakes at night with the sense that something is wrong. He calls security but gets no answer. He finds Mapes stabbed to death and is shot with a paralytic dart that burrows its way through his body shield and into his back, rendering him helpless. Yueh reveals himself as a traitor. He has lowered the shields and sabotaged Atreides communications. Yueh reveals to Leto that the Harkonnens secured his compliance because they have his wife held captive. He replaces one of Duke Leto's teeth with a poison capsule which he hopes the Duke can use to kill the Baron.Gurney is awakened and leads the counter attack as the Harkonnen forces, aided by the imperial Sardukar troops, begin their assault. The Atreides troops, caught unprepared and outnumbered by Harkonnen troops and the Sardukar, find themselves quickly overwhelmed. Duncan kills several Sardukar, takes an ornithopter and tries to rescue Paul and Jessica but finds them already gone.Baron Vladimir Harkonnen has promised Mohiam and the Bene Gesserit that he will not harm Paul or Jessica so he sends some of his men to take them to the desert to die of exposure. Paul, not fully secure in his Bene Gesserit abilities, is still able to use the Voice to order one of the men to remove his mother's gag. Jessica immediately orders one of the men to kill his comrade. When she's fully freed, she kills two of them personally. Their ornithopter is remotely disabled and lands. Paul and Jessica see the devastation of Arrakeen from a distance.Yueh meets with Baron Harkonnen and demands that the Baron honor his end of the deal. The Baron promises that Yueh will be reunited with his wife and then slits his throat. The Baron then gloats over a paralyzed Leto, who bites down on his fake tooth and expels the poison, killing everyone in the room except for the Baron who is gravely injured, having activated his body shield and used his anti-gravity suspensors to float to the ceiling. Medical technicians nurse the Baron back to health.Riding out a storm in a survival tent, Paul continues to have visions from his spice exposure. They are first of Chani. However, they quickly change to visions of bloody conflict and religious zealots, operating under the Atreides flag and in Duke Leto's name, spreading across the galaxy ""like and unquenchable fire"". Paul is horrified by what he sees and blames his mother and the Bene Gesserit but is eventually comforted by his mother.Paul and Jessica are rescued by Duncan Idaho, who managed to escape the slaughter. Duncan brings them to Kynes, who has set up in an abandoned terraforming station occupied by Fremen. The Sardukar track them there and attack, with the Fremen killing many of them. Duncan sacrifices himself in a last stand to allow Paul, Jessica, and Kynes to escape. Paul and Jessica flee in an ornithopter. Kynes sets up a thumper, intending to call a sandworm and ride it away, but she is mortally wounded by the Sardukar. Before they can deliver the killing blow, a sandworm arrives and Kynes attracts it to her by pounding a patch of drumsand. They are all swallowed by the worm.While piloting the ornithopter through a powerful sand storm, Paul has a vision of a Fremen man giving him advice, telling him that survival in the desert is a process and that he must move with the flow of the environment. Paul retracts the 'thopter's wings and allows them to be carried deeper into the desert by the vortex of the storm. They survive but with the ornithopter damaged they must set out on foot through the desert. As they do, they are observed by Fremen.Jessica and Paul make their way toward where they believe the Fremen sietch is. Their movements attract a sandworm and they make a run for some nearby rocks. The sandworm pauses, seemingly looking at Paul for few seconds before a thumper draws it away. A group of Fremen capture them. Stilgar is with them and recognizes Paul, saying that they can't touch him. Another Fremen, Jamis, dismisses Stilgar's belief and wants to kill Paul and Jessica and loot their bodies. Paul recognizes Jamis as the man from his visions.Jessica asks for help returning to Caladan, saying that they will be well rewarded, but Stilgar dismisses any reward they'd give as pointless. Stilgar offers to allow Paul, who is still young, to join their sietch, but says that Jessica, who he deems too old to learn to fight, must be left behind. Jessica and Paul use their Bene Gesserit training to disarm most of the Fremen and hold Stilgar at knife point. Stilgar, realizing that Jessica is a Bene Gesserit, relents and decides to take both of them to the sietch. Jamis objects, and challenges Jessica to a duel.Paul agrees to stand as his mother's champion. Chani, who is among the party, takes pity on Paul, who she believes will die at Jamis' hand, and gives him her crysknife, a dagger made from the tooth of the sandworm, a moment from one of Paul's visions. In the duel, Paul outclasses Jamis, repeatedly holding a knife to his throat and demanding that he yield. Stilgar informs him that Fremen duels are to the death, and Jessica says that Paul has never killed anyone before. Reluctantly, Paul kills Jamis. Satisfied, the Fremen take Paul and Jessica back to their sietch.Paul and Jessica see a Fremen impossibly riding a live worm. As they begin their journey into the desert, Chani tells Paul that ""this is only the beginning""."

However, she soon may be the Madrigals' last hope when she discovers that the magic surrounding the Encanto is now in danger.—anonymous Blessed to live in a secret, enchanted haven, the exceptional Madrigal family has found shelter in the bosom of a secured, mountainous realm in Colombia brimming with colour and kindness. However, as the mystical power of an inconspicuous artefact bestows its residents with supernatural gifts, introspective teen Mirabel has yet to receive her distinct talent. But when an unpredictable, terrible crisis puts the future of the tight-knit community in jeopardy, it is up to Mirabel to step up and try to save the day. Can the unlikely defender protect the family and find her true calling?—Nick Riganas It follows a multigenerational Colombian family, the Madrigals, led by a matriarch whose children and grandchildren - except for Mirabel Madrigal - receive magical gifts from a miracle that helps them serve the people in their rural community called the Encanto. When Mirabel learns that the family is losing their magic, she sets out to find out what is happening, and save her family and their magical house.—Wrathzo While escaping her home from armed conflict, a young Alma Madrigal loses her husband Pedro but saves her triplet infant children Julieta, Pepa, and Bruno. The candle Alma carries with her becomes magical and creates a sentient house, the ""Casita"", for the Madrigals to live in. Years later a village grows, protected by the Casita, and members of the Madrigal family are gifted superhuman abilities they use to help the villagers (""The Family Madrigal""). However, Bruno's gift of precognition causes multiple conflicts that lead to the family vilifying him, while Mirabel, Julieta's youngest daughter, is treated differently for having no gift at all.During the evening of Pepa's youngest son Antonio being gifted with the ability to speak to animals, Mirabel suddenly sees the Casita cracking, but her warnings go unheeded when the Casita is found seemingly fine (""Waiting On A Miracle""). Mirabel, resolving to save the magic of the Casita, goes around to investigate and question her family members. Her older sister Luisa - who possesses superhuman strength - suggests that Bruno's room may hold some clues to the phenomenon (""Surface Pressure""). There, Mirabel sees a cave of sand and pieces of a slab of opaque jade glass, which - when repaired - constitute an image supposedly showing her causing the Casita to fall apart. After Mirabel leaves, she discovers that her family members' gifts are starting to weaken (""We Don't Talk About Bruno"").At a dinner where Mirabel's oldest sister Isabela -who can make flowers grow at will - is to become engaged to neighboring villager Mariano Guzman, Mirabel's oldest cousin Dolores - who possesses superhuman hearing - admits to overhearing Mirabel talking with her father about Bruno's vision. Mariano's proposal gets ruined when the Casita once again begins to crack, causing Pepa - whose emotions control the weather - to conjure up a thunderstorm much to everyone's shock. Isabela then blames Mirabel despite the latter denying her involvement in the cataclysm. Amidst the situation, Mirabel suddenly catches a glimpse of a man who she then chases through a hidden passage in the walls, discovering that he was none other than Bruno himself, who never really left their house because he still loves his family. Mirabel convinces him to make predictions again and gets Antonio's permission to use the latter's room. Bruno makes another vision, which shows the Casita collapsing and an image of Mirabel embracing Isabela.Mirabel goes to apologize but instead learns of Isabela's burden of being perfect and her desire not to marry Mariano. Having poured out her feelings, Isabela's powers start to develop and both sisters reconcile (""What Else Can I Do?""). However, Alma discovers Mirabel's actions and thoughtlessly blames her for the family's misfortunes. Mirabel then finally snaps at her, saying how everything was truly all her fault for making everyone do things her way. Their argument suddenly creates a gigantic fissure that destroys the Casita while Alma's magical candle extinguishes in Mirabel's hands in her futile effort to save it, effectively stripping the Madrigals of their powers.Alma later finds a tearful Mirabel at the river where Pedro died and finally admits her fault of pressuring the family, forgetting that the real gift given was not the powers but the family itself (""Dos Oruguitas""). Both reconcile and, with Bruno in tow, reunite the Madrigals to rebuild the Casita, assisted by the villagers. When Mirabel places the last doorknob, the Casita springs back to life and the magic returns (""All Of You""). The movie ends with the Madrigals taking their first family picture with Mirabel and Bruno now included in it (""Colombia, Mi Encanto"")."

Candyman,2021,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9347730/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A sequel to the horror filmCandyman (1992)that returns to the now-gentrified Chicago neighborhood where the legend began. In present day, many years after the last of the Cabrini towers were torn down, Anthony and his partner move into a loft in the now gentrified Cabrini. A chance encounter with an old-timer exposes Anthony to the true story behind Candyman. Anxious to use these macabre details in his studio as fresh grist for paintings, he unknowingly opens a door to a complex past that unravels his own sanity and unleashes a terrifying wave of violence. Anthony McCoy (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) is a visual artist living in Chicago with his girlfriend, art gallery director Brianna Cartwright (Teyonah Parris). One night, Brianna's brother Troy (Nathan Stewart-Jarrett) shares the urban legend of Helen Lyle (Virginia Madsen), a white graduate student who went on a killing spree in the early 1990s. The story goes that her rampage culminated in a bonfire outside the Cabrini-Green projects, at which point she attempted to sacrifice an infant child. The residents were able to rescue the child from Helen before she perished in the fire in an apparent act of self-immolation.Desperate for a creative spark to turn his career around, Anthony latches on to this story and roams around Cabrini-Green looking for inspiration. He eventually has a chance encounter with William Burke (Colman Domingo), a launderette owner who introduces him to the story of Candyman. When Burke was a child, he had a frightening encounter with Sherman Fields (Michael Hargrove), a hook-handed man whom the police believed was responsible for putting a razor blade in a piece of candy that ended up in the hands of a white girl. Burke inadvertently alerted the police to his presence in the walls of one of the tower blocks, leading them to beat Sherman to death. Sherman was later exonerated when more children received candy with razor blades. The legend goes that repeating the name ""Candyman"" five times in front of a mirror invokes Sherman's spirit, at which point he appears in the reflection and kills whoever spoke his name.Inspired by this, Anthony develops an art exhibit around the legend of Candyman and showcases it at Brianna's gallery but is dismayed when he does not get the kind of reaction he was hoping for. That night, one of Brianna's co-workers and his girlfriend are slaughtered by Candyman after saying his name five times in front of a mirror. Their bodies are discovered in the morning by Brianna. More people are killed after repeating Candyman's name including an art critic and a group of teenage girls.Meanwhile, Anthony begins to undergo a physical transformation stemming from a bee sting he suffered on his hand while walking around Cabrini-Green. The sting develops into a scab that begins to spread and cover his whole body. Anthony later goes to a hospital to get checked out, where he learns that his mother lied about where he was born. Anthony soon pays a visit to his mother (Vanessa Williams), who reveals he was the baby Helen Lyle saved from the fire the night she died. Though the truth is that Helen saved him from Candyman, who abducted him and planned to sacrifice him in the fire, she never told him about it because she wanted Anthony to have a chance at a normal life. The community had vowed never to repeat the legend of Candyman after that night and his mother fears what will happen to Anthony now that someone has broken their pact. Anthony leaves resigned to his fate and wanders the row houses of Cabrini-Green.Concerned about Anthony, Brianna recalls him mentioning that he first heard about Candyman from Burke, so she heads to Cabrini-Green in hopes of finding him. Once there, Burke subdues Brianna and takes her to an abandoned church, where Anthony has entered a fugue state as his body continues to deteriorate.Burke reveals that not only did he witness the police beat Sherman to death but he also saw Sherman return later as the Candyman after which he butchered his older sister when she summoned him in the bathroom mirror of their apartment. He plans to have Anthony gunned down by the police, creating a new legend in which Candyman is an instrument of vengeance rather than a symbol of Black pain and suffering. To complete Anthony's transformation into Candyman, he saws off his right hand and replaces it with a hook.Brianna manages to escape the church and is chased into the Cabrini Green row houses by Burke, whom she viciously stabs to death. Anthony appears and collapses into her arms as the police, lured to the scene by Burke, show up and shoot Anthony to death. Brianna is handcuffed and placed in the back of a police SUV, where an officer attempts to intimidate her into agreeing that Anthony provoked the other officer into shooting him. Brianna uses the car's rearview mirror to summon Anthony, now Candyman, and he massacres every police officer at the scene. As more police arrive, Candyman takes on the appearance of Daniel Robitaille (Tony Todd) and gives Brianna a single instruction: ""Tell everyone."""

But a new boss baby with a cutting-edge approach and a can-do attitude is about to bring them together again.. and inspire a new family business.—DreamWorks Three long decades after the events ofThe Boss Baby (2017), Tim, now a stay-at-home dad with two daughters, and his younger brother Ted, now a billionaire CEO, are drifting apart. However, the apple doesn't fall far from the tree. Now, a new boss has emerged, eager to take the reins. Of course, the tiny leader has an audacious plan to thwart a sinister conspiracy. Will Tim and Ted reconnect for the sake of a challenging mission?—Nick Riganas Tim Templeton (James Marsden) (Ted Jr.'s older brother, Carol's husband) is now fully grown and lives with his wife Carol (Eva Longoria) and their two daughters, 7-year-old Tabitha (Ariana Greenblatt) and infant Tina (Amy Sedaris). Carol is a successful chef, while Tim is a stay at home husband and cares for the kids.Tim's younger brother Ted (Alec Baldwin) (a former executive of Baby Corp, Tim's younger brother) is now a successful CEO and is never around, but sends lavish gifts to the family. Tabitha is exhibiting more grown-up behavior, and one night while Tim wonders about the person his daughter is becoming, he hears something from Tina's room. He discovers that Tina is from Baby Corp, just as Ted once was, and that she has been assigned to get Ted there for a special mission. Tim refuses to call Ted, saying that he will never come (as he cares for nothing but his work), and encourages Tina to go back to sleep. However, Tina leaves a fake voicemail for Ted (using Tim's recorded voice), luring him to the Templetons' house.The next morning, Ted arrives and Tim explains to him that Tina is a Baby Corp dispatch. Tina introduces the brothers to a new formula that will allow them to turn back into children for 48 hours in order to infiltrate Tabitha's school and figure out what Dr. Erwin Armstrong (Jeff Goldblum), founder and principal of the school, is planning behind parents' backs. Dr Erwin espouses that parents are holding their kids back and Tim believes that he is the reason why Tabitha has been growing ever more distant from him.
Tim and Ted hide from Carol and leave her a note that they are going on a brother bonding trip. This is a good cover for them to complete their mission.At the school, Tim, now as his 7-year-old self, follows Tabitha to her class while baby Ted is placed with other babies. Ted rallies the babies to help him get out of the playroom so that he can go to Armstrong's office to investigate. Tim tries to get sent to the principal's office by disrupting class, but is instead put in ""The Box"" for timeout. Ted discovers that Armstrong is actually a baby himself (and has just built a grown up body around himself), having run away from home after realizing that he was smarter than his parents and now makes money by creating popular phone apps (all of these apps are created by babies who code). His ultimate plan is to get rid of every parent on B-Day (Baby revolution day), so that they cannot tell their children what to do anymore.Tim finds that Tabitha is excelling in her class, except for music. She struggles with the notes and this is putting her performance in the upcoming holiday pageant at risk. Tim speaks to Tabitha (as her classmate Marcos Lightspeed) and understands that Tabitha wants her dad Tim to be proud of her.Tim gets invited by Carol to her house, as Tabitha's friend. There he meets his own parents Ted Templeton Sr. (Jimmy Kimmel) & Janice Templeton (Lisa Kudrow), who tell ""Marcos"" that Tim is an unreliable dad. He had a very active imagination as a kid and imagined seeing his baby brother walk and talk.
""Marcos"" helps Tabitha practice for her performance.On the night of the holiday pageant, where Tabitha is supposed to sing a solo, the brothers and Tina plan to expose Armstrong. However, they learn that B-Day is set to happen that night through Armstrong's new app, QT-Snap, which will hypnotize the parents into mindless zombies. Tina tries to organize Ted to try and turn off the master power switch, that will stop the app upload. Tim stops Ted, since Tabitha is due to perform shortly. Both Tim and Ted are caught by Armstrong's ninja babies and are put in The Box, which slowly starts to fill with water. Tabitha sings her solo, but when she sees that Tim has not showed up, she runs off the stage crying. She is consoled by Tina, who reveals her identity and her mission. Tabitha agrees to help her younger sister by getting to the server and shutting down QT-Snap before it can go worldwide. Ted is able to call Precious, Tabitha's pet pony, into the school, as she breaks them out of The Box.Tim and Ted reach the server first, but they are stopped by Armstrong, who calls the zombie parents for backup. Tabitha realizes that Marcos is really Tim. While the brothers hold them back as the formula starts to wear off, Tina and Tabitha get up to the server. Tabitha is able to hack in and pull up the shutdown screen, but is interrupted by Armstrong. The sisters then set off a candy lava volcano using Mentos and soda, destroying the servers and turning all parents back to normal.

The Addams Family 2,2021,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11125620/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The Addams get tangled up in more wacky adventures and find themselves involved in hilarious run-ins with all sorts of unsuspecting characters. Sequel to the 2019 animated film, 'The Addams Family'. Everyone's favorite spooky family is back in the animated comedy sequel, The Addams Family 2. In this all new movie we find Morticia and Gomez distraught that their children are growing up, skipping family dinners, and totally consumed with ""scream time."" To reclaim their bond they decide to cram Wednesday, Pugsley, Uncle Fester and the crew into their haunted camper and hit the road for one last miserable family vacation. Their adventure across America takes them out of their element and into hilarious run-ins with their iconic cousin, It, as well as many new kooky characters. What could possibly go wrong?—MGM At a middle school science fair, Wednesday Addams is set to present her experiment, but is dismayed when her family - Gomez, Morticia, and Pugsley - show up. She proceeds with the presentation, where she uses her pet squid Socrates' DNA on Uncle Fester to show how humans can be improved. The experiment is a success, but when Wednesday goes up to accept what she thinks will be a first place prize, she finds that everyone got a trophy for their efforts. Her work, however, gets noticed by scientist Cyrus Strange, who appears through a holographic projection to let her know he thinks her work is brilliant. Meanwhile, Pugsley attempts to impress girls by tweaking another kid's volcano project, but it ends up causing a huge disaster in the gym that sends everyone running.Back at the Addams home, Wednesday and Pugsley decline to show up for dinner. Fester goes up to Pugsley's room to try and help him find a way to woo the ladies. Wednesday sends her parents a very specific note for why she isn't coming to dinner. Gomez worries that the kids are drifting apart from him and Morticia, so he decides to take them on a family vacation.Gomez brings out a hideous road vehicle and gets Thing, Fester, the kids, and Lurch to join him and Morticia on the road while Grandmama stays behind to take care of the house. Before they hit the road, a lawyer named Mr. Mustela approaches Gomez and Morticia with the implication that Wednesday was switched as a baby at the hospital, meaning she may not really be an Addams, but the two ignore him and think it's just Wednesday trying to get out of going on the trip, but she says that she doesn't know who that man is. Once the family is gone, Grandmama throws a huge party. On the road, Mustela and his hulking henchman Pongo pursue the Addams family.The family is initially set on going to Salem, but Fester ends up making a detour to Niagara Falls because he is suddenly obsessed with water due to him mutating because of Wednesday's experiment with the squid. Pugsley tries to make another attempt with girls per Fester's advice, but his cheesy line backfires. Wednesday gets a voodoo doll of him and uses Pugsley to perform some dance moves, until she just tosses the doll over the Falls to torment her brother. When Gomez and Morticia attempt to bond with Wednesday, she snubs them. They then spot Mustela and Pongo looking for them, and Fester ends up knocking Mustela into the water before recovering Pugsley.The family then stops in Sleepy Hollow where they set up camp. While gathered around the fire, Gomez and Morticia bring up Mustela and his claims about Wednesday, so Fester mentions a story from the night Wednesday was born where he went into the delivery room to see her, but all the other babies were crying, so he employed an Addams family tradition of putting babies to sleep by taking them out of their beds and juggling them all, potentially mixing up many babies in the process. This only worsens Gomez and Morticia's fears that Wednesday was switched. Wednesday overhears the discussion and muses to Lurch about where she might really come from.Gomez brings everyone to Miami in an attempt to get in touch with Cousin Itt so he can help with their current dilemma. Itt joins them on the trip as they pass through San Antonio where he talks to Wednesday about his own rebellious phase in his youth, but he essentially says he owned up to who he really is. When Grandmama calls him to help with the house party since she let it get out of hand, Itt must bail. Mustela and Pongo almost catch up with them, but Lurch knocks them away.To hide from their pursuers, the family goes to a motel where they enter a displeased Wednesday into a girls beauty pageant where she creates a scene. Mustela enters, but is distracted long enough for the family to escape.The Addams' stop at the Grand Canyon where Itt flies off from them, and Morticia gives Wednesday a necklace containing the blood of the Addams family members. Pugsley blows up the canyon, drawing more unwanted attention. Meanwhile, Fester starts to mutate further into a squid-man. Wednesday goes off by herself where Mustela attempts to get her again, but she gets the drop on him and traps him. His phone rings, and she sees that he was employed by Cyrus Strange, who suggests to Wednesday that he is her true father and that he is inviting her to stay with him in Sausalito where she can hone in her potential in science. Wednesday runs a DNA test using Gomez's hair, which seemingly proves that she most certainly is not his daughter.Wednesday leaves the family while they sleep, but Lurch catches up with her to keep her safe. The rest of her family learns where she is headed and go after her. Wednesday and Lurch stop at a biker bar to ask for help in getting to Sausalito, which they do after Lurch shows off his piano and singing skills by performing ""I Will Survive"". The bikers then escort the two to Sausalito.Wednesday arrives at Cyrus's home and meets his wife Ingrid, a bird-like humanoid being, and their pig-like daughter, Ophelia. Cyrus brings her to his lab where he shows her a formula he developed much like Wednesday's own that she used on Fester regarding human-animal hybrids. The rest of the Addams clan shows up, but Wednesday seems fully set on staying with Cyrus and no longer accepting them as her family. While Gomez and Morticia are sad, Pugsley tries to bond with Ophelia since they seem to be mutually attracted. However, Ophelia morphs into a pig, as that is what she originally was. When Pugsley brings this revelation to his parents, Cyrus reveals the truth and that he was just using Wednesday since her formula works better than his own. He then captures the family.Cyrus traps the clan in tubes where he plans to mutate them with his formula. He shows them to Wednesday so that she may remove any traits of theirs that she doesn't like, but she doesn't like seeing them trapped this way. She turns on Cyrus, but when he tries to have Pongo go after her and Lurch, it is then revealed that Lurch and Pongo knew each other and were really good friends at the asylum they were locked up at before Lurch was found by Gomez and Morticia. Pongo warned Lurch with a look that Wednesday was in danger. Together, the two brutes free the Addams family and knock Cyrus into a tube where he is doused with his potion. It turns him into a gigantic animal hybrid monster. When he goes after the family, Fester comes out as a giant squid monster, and the two fight until they both tumble out the window. Cyrus falls to his death while Fester pulls himself up with his tentacle, but he is now weakened. Wednesday uses the blood in the necklace that Morticia gave her, and Fester turns back to normal and is revived. Wednesday decides she is proud to be an Addams and reunites with her family.The family returns home, with Ophelia joining them as a regular human girl, where Itt has helped Grandmama turn the party around. While Wednesday knows Cyrus fabricated the DNA test results, she wonders how her test came out so that she isn't related to Gomez. He reveals his hair is a toupee, but that she is 100% his daughter. The family then goes on another road trip around the world."
The Suicide Squad,2021,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6334354/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Supervillains Harley Quinn, Bloodsport, Peacemaker, and a collection of nutty cons at Belle Reve prison join the super-secret, super-shady Task Force X as they are dropped off at the remote, enemy-infused island of Corto Maltese. In exchange for lighter sentences, just like the anti-hero team inSuicide Squad (2016), a new batch of Belle Reve's meta-humans strike a deal with the cold head of Task Force X, Amanda Waller. This time, her ragtag band of super-powered convicts--Harley Quinn, Bloodsport, Peacemaker, King Shark, Polka-Dot Man, and Ratcatcher 2--venture into the peril-laden South American island nation of Corto Maltese to find the Thinker: the evil scientist in charge of the mysterious Project Starfish. But, as the band joins forces with an old leader of the notorious team, humankind is on the verge of extinction. Can the expendable Suicide Squad stop the new menace that could mean the end of the world as we know it?—Nick Riganas The film opens at Belle Reve Penitentiary where Brian Durland/Savant (Michael Rooker) is in his break room throwing a ball around at targets that he has precisely set up. He even uses his skills to bounce the ball off the walls and kill a canary. He is then pulled away by Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) as she assigns him to a task.Savant is thrown into Task Force X/The ""Suicide Squad"" (also known as Team 2) alongside Blackguard (Pete Davidson), Captain Boomerang (Jai Courtney), Weasel (Sean Gunn), Mongal (Mayling Ng), Javelin (Flula Borg), The Detachable Kid/TDK (Nathan Filion), and Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie). Led by Rick Flag (Joel Kinnaman), the team travels to the island of Corto Maltese for their mission. Upon arriving, Weasel falls into the water and apparently drowns since nobody knew he couldn't swim. When the Squad makes it to land, Blackguard steps out and reveals he brought the team to the mercenaries waiting for them on the beach. For his troubles, he gets his face blown off. Harley goes in blasting while Boomerang throws his signature weapon to slice some heads off. TDK's arms pop off so he can use them as (ineffective) weapons. The mercenaries retaliate and shoot TDK and Javelin dead. Mongal attempts to bring a chopper down but it crashes and she burns to death. Boomerang is impaled with wood and then shredded by the chopper's blades. Harley and Flag go missing while Savant attempts to flee the chaos. Although Waller warns him, she detonates the explosive in the back of his head, causing it to blow up. She then sends in her second team to finish the job.Three days earlier.......Amanda Waller goes to recruit Robert DuBois/Bloodsport (Idris Elba), a deadly mercenary who is there for putting Superman in the ICU with a kryptonite bullet. Her leverage against him is Bloodsport's teenage daughter Tyla (Storm Reid), who is in danger of serving time for stealing. The two argue loudly, as Tyla makes it clear that Bloodsport was a bad father. He goes to threaten Waller into releasing Tyla, but she knows he is going to comply regardless. After he relents, she introduces him to her other recruits - Christopher Smith/Peacemaker (John Cena), a patriotic mercenary; Cleo Cazo/Ratcatcher 2 (Daniela Melchior), who has the ability to control rats and keeps one named Sebastian close by; Nanaue/King Shark (Sylvester Stallone), an underwater prince with a taste for human meat; and Abner Krill/Polka Dot Man (David Dastmalchian), a man with an unusual genetic disorder whose specialty is throwing weaponized polka dots.Waller informs the team about the situation in Corto Maltese - the nation was overthrown by a dictator named Silvio Luna (Juan Diego Botto) and his right-hand man General Mateo Suarez (Joaquin Cosio) after they executed the presidential family. They are operating in a Nazi-era research facility called Jotunheim where they are conducting dangerous experiments, code-named ""Project Starfish"". The Squad is assigned to find Dr. Gaius Grieves/The Thinker (Peter Capaldi) since he can lead them to Jotunheim and they can destroy whatever is going on in there. We jump to the facility where Luna and Suarez are observing their work, a gigantic starfish alien creature.Presently, while Team 2 is making their way through the jungle, they come across a group that they believe to be mercenaries in league with the military, so the Squad kills them before they make it to the camp where Flag is hanging out with his contact Sol Soria (Alice Braga), a dissident whose team, the Freedom Fighters, is trying to take Corto Maltese back from Luna and Suarez...and unfortunately her team was the group that the Squad just killed. The team walks out of the jungle when they notice Polka Dot Man glowing different colors. He explains that his condition happened because his mother worked at STAR Labs and experimented on him and his siblings to give them superpowers. His condition forces him to drain the dots out of him or he will die, and he views all of his enemies as his mother before killing them. Before heading to Jotunheim, Flag insists that they recover Harley.Harley has been taken captive by Luna's men, but he brings her to his room to woo her since she is seen in the country as a symbol of anti-American anarchy. Harley is initially charmed by him, and he even asks her to marry him. However, when he reveals his plan of using whatever is in Jotunheim to eliminate anyone who threatens his regime, even if it means killing children. This crosses Harley and she shoots Luna dead, leading to his men to capture and imprison her.The Squad is being taken by Sol's contact Milton (Julio Cesar Ruiz) to go to a bar called La Gatita Amable where they will find Thinker. On the road there, Ratcatcher asks Bloodsport why he is afraid of rats, as he is always recoiling around Sebastian even though, according to Cleo, he sees good in Bloodsport. DuBois states that his father once punished him with rats, and it lead to his phobia. When he asks her why she is so drawn to rats, she explains that her father, Ratcatcher 1 (Taika Waititi), taught her how to control them but also treat them as family, but he was a drug addict and ultimately overdosed when she was a child. Bloodsport and Ratcatcher promise to one another that they will get each other out alive. The team makes it to the bar, but Nanaue has to stay behind since he will stick out.The Squad drinks and dances before they spot Thinker. They apprehend him, but the military comes in to search everyone since they know that there are Americans in there. Bloodsport sends Ratcatcher outside with Thinker while he, Peacemaker, and Polka Dot Man are all taken in. On the road, the three subdue the gunmen and kill the driver before their van is run off the road. Ratcatcher and King Shark arrive with Thinker in tow.Meanwhile, Harley is being tortured by Suarez's men for information, but she never budges. When she is left alone with his guard, she snaps his neck with her legs and sets herself free. Harley proceeds to shoot down Suarez's guards before getting her hands on some blades and Javelin's... javelin to slaughter her way through the guards. Outside, Flag tries to lead the Squad to rescue Harley until she shows up and joins them. They then get Thinker and order him to get them inside Jotunheim.Once inside (and after Milton is killed), Thinker leads the Squad to the creature that he calls Starro The Conqueror. Peacemaker and Nanaue set up bombs all over the place. Thinker reveals to the Squad that the American government was behind the experiments involving Starro since they have been secretly funding Corto Maltese for decades. Starro also emits smaller starfish that attach themselves to human faces and take over their bodies like zombies, and there are slews of corpses of Starro's other victims all over the facility. Starro breaks free and grabs Thinker, tearing him in two and splattering him across the wall. Flag attempts to secure the hard drive with evidence against the American government to deliver to the press, but Peacemaker turns on him per Waller's orders. The two fight each other, with Flag nearly choking Peacemaker to death, but he stabs Flag through the heart with a piece of a broken sink. Ratcatcher witnesses this and grabs the flash drive while Peacemaker attempts to kill her. Meanwhile, Nanaue comes across small fish that mimic him, until their aquarium is broken and they begin to leech onto him, all while Bloodsport, Harley, and Polka Dot Man try to survive the crumbling facility. Bloodsport manages to survive going through several stories before he lands and witnesses Peacemaker getting ready to execute Ratcatcher. The two mercs draw their guns and fire their bullets at each other, with Bloodsport's bullet breaking through Peacemaker's and striking him in the throat, bringing him down.King Shark falls outside and is shot by Suarez's men, but he rises and bites the head off one gunmen before the rest of the Squad runs out of the facility as Starro bursts out. It releases more starfish that kill Suarez and his men and then proceeds to make its way into the city. Waller declares the mission over since the evidence is destroyed, but the surviving members want to save the city. Waller threatens to detonate their devices and kill them on the spot until her subordinate, Flo Crawley (Tinashe Kajese) brains her with a golf club and has the rest of the team guide the Squad to save the city. At the same time, Sol and her team execute the remaining members of the regime to stage their coup and take their country back.Bloodsport begins blasting away at Starro while King Shark goes ""nom nom"" on the alien and starts to bite into it. Polka Dot Man envisions Starro as his mother and unleashes his polka dots to burn Starro's leg, but the alien crushes him. Ratcatcher tries to use her beacon to summon the rats, but Bloodsport pushes her out of the way before she is killed. She then uses the beacon and gets practically every rat in the city to take down the infected citizens and start to take Starro down. Harley then charges into Starro's eye with the javelin and breaks through before the rats make their way inside and take Starro down from the inside, finally killing it and saving the city. The Squad's heroics are broadcast on the news, and Tyla acknowledges her father as a hero.Bloodsport contacts Waller, ordering her to let the team and Tyla go free, or they will leak the evidence from the laboratory to the press. She reluctantly agrees and calls for the chopper to bring them home. As the team rests, Sebastian crawls onto Bloodsport's leg, and he begins to pet the rat.Mid-Credits Scene: Weasel is shown to still be alive and starts wandering into the jungle of Corto Maltese.Post-Credits Scene: Waller's subordinates John Economos (Steve Agee) and Emilia Harcourt (Jennifer Holland) are brought to a room where they find that Peacemaker is still alive, because Waller needs him, as Harcourt puts it, ""to save the fucking world."""
Raya and the Last Dragon,2021,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5109280/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"In a realm known as Kumandra, a re-imagined Earth inhabited by an ancient civilization, a warrior named Raya is determined to find the last dragon. Long ago, in the fantasy world of Kumandra, humans and dragons lived together in harmony. However, when sinister monsters known as the Druun threatened the land, the dragons sacrificed themselves to save humanity. Now, 500 years later, those same monsters have returned, and it's up to a lone warrior to track down the last dragon and stop the Druun for good. Five long centuries after the selfless sacrifice of the magical dragons, the once-peaceful land of Kumandra, where humans lived harmoniously alongside the mystical creatures, is in disarray, divided into five nations.

Will Raya ever find mighty Sisu, the last dragon?—Nick Riganas 500 years prior, Kumandra was a prosperous land when evil spirits called the Druun began to ravage everything. They absorbed souls, turning those into stone. Eventually, the dragons of Kumandra used what was left of their magic to create an orb that not only warded off the Druun, but also restored everyone to life, with the exception of the dragons who remained turned to stone. The people all wanted the power of the orb which ultimately divided them into tribes based on their placement of a giant river made to resemble a dragon: Fang, Heart, Tail, Spine and Talon.

She ends up in what is left of the desert like Tail Tribe and manages to summon Sisu. She admits that she did not create the orb and that her older siblings did, but finds that she can use their powers when she holds onto a piece. They find what is left of the Tail Temple and recover the second piece with Sisu now gaining the ability to turn into a human. They encounter Namaari and her tribe, but the two of them manage to escape on a boat driven by a young entrepreneur named Boun, who had lost his family to the Druun. Despite Boun being friendly, Raya refuses to divulge that Sisu is a dragon, nor tell him of her quest, confusing Sisu.They arrive at the Talon Tribe, who have built their homes over the water to protect themselves against the Druun, as Raya tries to find their leader so that she can reclaim the orb piece. While out in the town, Raya encounters a ""con baby"" named Little Noi and her trio of monkey-like companions the Ongis, who adopted her after her mother was lost to the Druun. After a chase, Raya decides to hire them to help her. Sisu goes into town to look for a gift, as she thinks it is better than fighting, only to run into the real tribe leader who threatens her. Raya rescues her and reclaims the piece, which allows Sisu to make smoke clouds, and make it back to Boun with Noi and the Ongis joining them.The group arrive at the Spine Tribe with Raya and Sisu attempting to enter the village. They are caught by the sole survivor of the tribe, a fearsome warrior named Tong, who actually does not know what to do with them. The rest of the group arrive to warn them of Namaari's arrival. Raya holds her off in a fight while the others escape. However, Sisu reverts to her dragon form and fends off Namaari and the Fang Tribe. Before leaving, Namaari is moved by the appearance of Sisu. She returns to Virana to tell her, but she instead demands that she reclaim the pieces and the dragon as she fears that the other tribes will try to take what they have. Back at the boat, Raya finally comes clean to her party about Sisu and they agree to work together with Tong giving the orb piece he had been guarding and allowing Sisu to gain the ability to summon the rains.As they get close to the Fang Tribe, Raya suggests breaking in to reclaim the final piece, but Sisu suggests giving them a gift and asking it back. When Raya refuses, Sisu takes her back to what is left of the Heart Tribe and reveals the fate of her siblings. While Sisu did not create the orb, her siblings trusted her enough to do the right thing with it. Raya gives in and decides to give Namaari the dragon pendant as a piece offering so that she can rejoin the rest of the orb pieces. Raya and Sisu meet privately with Namaari, but as soon as she shows the remainder of the orb pieces, Namaari holds a crossbow to them. Sisu tries to talk her down, but Raya, sensing that Namaari will shoot, attacks her, causing Sisu to get hit by the arrow and falls into a river. Namaari flees as the water, which protected the Fang Tribe against the Druun, begins to recede.The Fang Tribe is attacked by the Druun as Raya enters to confront Namaari, who is grieving Virana's fate at the hands of the Druun. The two fight while Tong, Boun, Noi and the Ongis rescue the people from the Druun. Raya prepares to strike down Namaari, but she tells her that she has lost everything and does not care anymore. Raya comes to her senses and she goes to help her friends. Namaari in turn helps the group using her orb piece. As the pieces start losing power, they fall into a pit and are surrounded by the Druun. Raya tells them that they need to put the pieces together, but her friends refuse to help Namaari. To show her faith, Raya puts her piece down and allows the Druun to take her. One by the one the rest follow with Namaari putting the pieces together and getting consumed by the Druun afterwards. The plan works and the Druun are vanquished as everyone is brought back to life.The dragons are all brought back to life as they revive Sisu who thanks Raya for trusting others. Everyone returns to their significant others as Raya returns home to be reunited with Benga. She introduces him to Sisu as all the tribes come together peacefully to celebrate."

House of Gucci is inspired by the family empire behind the Italian fashion house of Gucci. When Patrizia Reggiani (Lady Gaga), an outsider from humble beginnings, marries into the Gucci family, her unbridled ambition begins to unravel the family legacy and triggers a reckless spiral of betrayal, decadence, revenge, and ultimately...murder. Milan, 1978. Over the protests of his ailing, haughty father,Maurizio D'Ancora, handsome heir and law student Maurizio Gucci embarks on a whirlwind romance withPatrizia Reggiani, an assertive middle-class arriviste. As the young couple builds a future together, Patrizia immediately gains an unexpected ally in the shape of sly Uncle Aldo and, little by little, gets her hooks into the Gucci fashion empire. Now, whoever is not with Patrizia is against her. But couples should stay together for richer or for poorer, in sickness and in health. However, can the glamorous House of Gucci survive Patrizia's subtle machinations?—Nick Riganas In 1978, Patrizia Reggiani is a young, attractive Italian woman working as an office manager within her father's small trucking firm. At a party, Patrizia meets Maurizio Gucci, a law student and heir to a 50% interest in the Gucci fashion house through his father Rodolfo. Patrizia aggressively pursues the awkward Maurizio, charming him into love. Rodolfo warns Maurizio that Patrizia is only after wealth and tells Maurizio that he will disinherit him if he marries Patrizia. Maurizio chooses Patrizia over his connection to Gucci, leaving the family. Patrizia and Maurizio marry, and Maurizio takes a job at the Reggiani trucking company. When Patrizia becomes pregnant, she sees her child as an avenue for familial reconciliation. She lets it slip to Maurizio's uncle Aldo that she is pregnant; Aldo is delighted by the news and takes the couple under his wing. Aldo introduces Patrizia to his unintelligent son Paolo, who aspires to be a designer within Gucci despite his lack of talent. Thanks to Aldo, Maurizio and a terminally ill Rodolfo reconcile shortly before the latter's death. Rodolfo writes Maurizio back into his will, but fails to sign a document transferring the Gucci shares to him before he dies. Patrizia fakes Rodolfo's signature, giving Maurizio a 50% interest in Gucci. Patrizia starts to devise a plot to obtain a controlling interest in Gucci by acquiring some of Aldo and Paolo's shares (the two hold the other 50% interest). She clashes with Aldo over the firm's clandestine sale of cheap ""fake"" Gucci products on the black market, and begins to consult Giuseppina, a psychic, for guidance. She manipulates Maurizio, who has little real interest in Gucci, into taking a more active role within the company. Paolo acquires proof that Aldo has been evading taxes in the United States; he gives the proof to Patrizia in exchange for her promise that he will be allowed to design his own line. Aldo is arrested by the IRS and sentenced to a year and a day in prison. Patrizia lies to the Italian police and tells them that Paolo is not authorized to use the Gucci trademark; the police stop the fashion show by force. Patrizia and Maurizio ask Paolo to sell them his shares, but he rebuffs them and cuts ties between them. Italian police ransack Maurizio's house and attempt to arrest Maurizio for forging Rodolfo's signature. Maurizio and Patrizia flee to Switzerland, where Maurizio meets his old friend Paola Franchi. After an argument between Maurizio and Patrizia, Maurizio decides that he is tired of his wife's influence on himself and the company. He orders his wife and daughter to return to Italy and begins an affair with Paola. When Maurizio's business plans harm the company, he seeks assistance from equity company Investcorp, through which he hatches a scheme to acquire shares of the company from a now-impoverished Paolo. Aldo returns from prison and immediately realizes what Paolo has done. When Investcorp offers to buy Aldo out, he refuses until Maurizio reveals himself as the deal's instigator. Dejected, Aldo sells the shares and cuts contact with Maurizio. Patrizia attempts a reconciliation with Maurizio, but he flatly ignores her. Later, he asks Patrizia for a divorce through his long-time assistant Domenico De Sole, which Patrizia refuses. Maurizio recruits up-and-coming designer Tom Ford to revitalize the company's image through a new line. Ford's products are successful, but Maurizio has so thoroughly mismanaged the company that Investcorp's leaders feel compelled to buy him out, replacing him with Ford and De Sole. Patrizia eventually grows so furious with Maurizio that she asks Giuseppina to help her kill him. Giuseppina puts Patrizia in contact with some hitmen ""from Sicily."" A few days later, the hitmen shoot Maurizio to death in broad daylight outside his residence. Closing title cards to describe the fate of the remaining characters: Aldo dies of prostate cancer and Paolo died in poverty shortly following the sale of their shares to Maurizio. Patrizia, Giuseppina, and the hitmen are sentenced to long prison terms following their arrest for murder. Gucci is fully acquired by Investcorp and successfully managed into the present; no Gucci family members remain at the company."

Old,2021,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10954652/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A vacationing family discovers that the secluded beach where they're relaxing for a few hours is somehow causing them to age rapidly, reducing their entire lives into a single day. This summer, visionary filmmaker M. Night Shyamalan unveils a chilling, mysterious new thriller about a family on a tropical holiday who discover that the secluded beach where they are relaxing for a few hours is somehow causing them to age rapidly - reducing their entire lives into a single day.—Universal Pictures In high hopes of spending the ideal tropical holiday and strengthening family bonds, overworked married couple Guy and Prisca and their kids arrive at a luxurious, suspiciously affordable resort. Instead, they are in for a big surprise, as a brief visit to a secret private beach triggers a series of inexplicable, logic-defying psychosomatic changes that affect all the guests of the secluded hideout. But on this sandy, impossible-to-find beach, time flies. Wouldn't it be great if the unclouded present could be ours for keeps?—Nick Riganas The Kapa family - parents Guy (Gael Garcia Bernal) and Prisca (Vicky Krieps) and their kids eight-year-old Maddox (Alexa Swinton) and six-year-old Trent (Nolan River) - arrive at a fancy resort for a family vacation. After settling into their rooms, Trent befriends a young boy named Idlib (Kailen Jude), and they do activities like ask other resort patrons what their names and jobs are, and Idlib shows Trent a special code to decipher messages. Meanwhile, Guy and Prisca discuss that this is just one last trip they wanted to give the kids before they divorce, which is made worse because Prisca is suffering from a stomach tumor.At breakfast, a middle-aged doctor named Charles (Rufus Sewell) is sitting with his younger vain wife Chrystal (Abbey Lee), daughter Kara (Kyle Bailey), and his mother Agnes (Kathleen Chalfant). Nearby, a woman named Patricia (Nikki Amuka-Bird) is having an epileptic seizure, which Charles helps with while her husband Jarin (Ken Leung) also tries to help. Trent also spots Idlib, as they made plans to hang out again that day, but the resort manager (Gustaf Hammarsten) makes him leave the area.The Kapas, plus Charles and his family, all board a van that takes them to a private beach. There, Maddox recognizes a rapper, Mid-Size Sedan/real name Brendan Smith (Aaron Pierre), who was earlier seen with a female companion who went skinny-dipping. The kids all play together while the adults lounge on the sand. The girls find old dolls buried in the sand, left behind by other kids. Trent swims by a cave when he discovers the body of Brendan's companion, apparently having drowned. The adults examine the body, while Brendan is suffering from nosebleeds and is equally stunned at the discovery. Charles suspects Brendan of foul play, though he maintains that the woman only went for a swim and never came back. Not long after, Agnes begins to fall short of breath before she also dies.Jarin and Patricia arrive at the beach as well, but the people who brought them are already gone. The kids also start to experience something weird. Brendan explains to the adults that the woman he was with had multiple sclerosis while he has hemophilia, which explains his constant nosebleeds. Jarin and Patricia talk to Trent and Maddox, who have suddenly aged up into pre-teenagers (Trent now played by Luca Faustino Rodriguez, Maddox played by Thomasin McKenzie), along with Kara (now played by Mikayla Fisher).Several attempts are made to leave the beach, by going through the rocks that close off the beach from the outside, but all the adults that attempt to pass through feel a pounding in their heads before they black out and end up back on the beach. They also notice unusual things, like when Charles attacks Brendan with a knife, the slash mark heals within seconds. Not long after, Brendan finds that the dead body of the woman he was with has now fully decomposed to nothing but bones within hours, making them realize that there is something time-related occurring on the beach. Suddenly, the tumor in Prisca's stomach starts to cause her pain and distress. The adults try to help her, with them feeling around for the tumor at first and describing it as the size of a golf ball. They proceed to perform a surgery to remove the tumor, which has now grown to the size of a cantaloupe. The cut in Prisca's stomach heals rapidly after the procedure.Trent and Kara age up even more into teenagers/young adults (Trent now played by Alex Wolff, Kara played by Eliza Scanlen). What's more is that Kara has somehow become five months pregnant within a matter of minutes (after apparently having sex with Trent minutes earlier. The adults prepare themselves for the birth, which happens rather quickly, but the baby dies after a minute due to lack of attention. The other adults start to show more visible signs of aging, but Chrystal takes the process much harder than the others.Charles starts to lose his mind to schizophrenia, leading him to stab Brendan to death. The others take his weapon away while trying to come up with an alternate plan of escape. Knowing they can't go through the rocks, Jarin attempts to swim to find a way out. While this happens, Trent and Maddox come across a notebook left by a previous visitor, with names and medical conditions written down. They also notice what looks like people in the distance observing them.Maddox talks to Prisca about whether or not she and Guy are splitting up. Prisca admits that she was seeing another man. Although Prisca tries to explain herself, Maddox is angry with her. She goes out to the beach and attempts to be strong and find a way out herself, but she finds Jarin's body, apparently having gone unconscious and drowned. Upon seeing his body, Patricia suffers a fatal seizure. Kara then desperately tries to find a way out and starts climbing up the rocks to try and make it to the top, but before she can make it high enough, she too blacks out and falls to her death, leaving Trent devastated.It is now nighttime. Charles has become fully unhinged while Chrystal is also losing her mind at her rapid aging and declining physical state (she has grown a calcium hump on her back). Guy is also losing his eyesight, and Prisca is noticeably grayer. Guy and Prisca talk about the other man in Prisca's life, with Guy admitting he knew about him and wished that he did more to keep their marriage working, but he also notes that the other guy is a loser and that she deserves someone better. Charles then starts to attack Guy and Prisca, while Trent and Maddox are attacked by Chrystal when they try to look at her. She follows them into the cave and her body becomes twisted and contorted to horrible angles before she dies there. Prisca then slashes Charles with a rusty knife, causing an infection that rapidly spreads through his body and kills him.The Kapas then gather around the campfire and the beach. The now elderly Guy is having a hard time speaking and remembering things, but he essentially admits to Prisca that he still loves her just before he dies. Prisca then stands up for a moment but collapses and dies by Guy's side while both kids mourn their parents.In the morning, Trent and Maddox are now in their 50's (Trent played by Emun Elliott, Maddox played by Embeth Davidtz). Trent brings up a code that Idlib gave him, which he deciphered and figured out means ""My uncle doesn't like the coral"". The siblings spot a coral reef nearby and realize that it must be their way out. The two swim out there, but Maddox's clothing gets stuck on the coral. When the two don't resurface, Theo, the van driver that brought the families to the beach (director M. Night Shyamalan) reports to his bosses, from his observation post on a cliff overlooking the beach, that all members of ""Trial 73"" have perished.When Theo drives back to the resort and to a lab area, it is then revealed that the resort is a front for a medical research team named Warren & Warren that lures people with medical conditions to the beach in order to perform clinical trials for life-saving drugs, given to them in the cocktails served upon arriving. They know that the supernatural beach (possibly powered by the mystical coral) speeds up the aging process, so they reduce the trials to a whole day for better results. They believe they cured Patricia's epilepsy since she didn't have a seizure for eight hours, which is equivalent to about 16 years on the beach.The resort manager and others attempt to poach their latest victims until they are stopped by Trent and Maddox, who managed to free themselves from the coral. Trent finds a man he spoke to when he was still a kid, knowing the man is a police officer. He hands the man the journal found on the beach, which details the names of many missing people and their medical conditions. Idlib comes out and recognizes Trent even as an adult. Trent and Maddox reveal the truth to everyone while all the resort staff realizes they are screwed.Authorities come to arrest all the resort employees, while in the final scene, the officer takes Trent and Maddox by helicopter away from the island to be with their aunt, who is not ready to see that her niece and nephew are full-grown adults."

The Forever Purge,2021,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10327252/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"All the rules are broken as a sect of lawless marauders decides that the annual Purge does not stop at daybreak and instead should never end. The rules are all broken as the annual Purge continues even after the holiday ends. A group of survivors in Texas must find a way to get across the Mexican border and makes it out alive while the whole country around them springs into complete chaos.—alonzovillafra In 2048, eight years after Charlene Roan's presidential election, the New Founding Fathers of America (NFFA) have regained control of the U.S. government and have re-instituted the annual Purge with its original rules. Racial supremacy and nativism have surged nationwide following their re-election, and many outside the ruling party are concerned that the upcoming Purge will inflict more damage on the country than the NFFA realizes. Married migrant couple Juan and Adela illegally cross the border into Texas to escape from a Mexican drug cartel and build a new life, with Juan working as a farmhand on the Tucker family ranch while Adela begins working near Austin.Ten months later, on the eve of the next annual Purge, Juan and Adela join a migrant community behind a walled sanctuary with armed security to protect them. As the Purge begins, Adela witnesses a Purger group, who declare themselves to be a ""Purge Purification Force"" (PPF) that intend to kill those people that they consider non-American. The group passes by without hostility, and the migrant community survives the Purge with no incidents. Come morning, Juan and Adela return to their jobs, but both notice that many of their co-workers did not report to work. Shortly after, Adela is attacked by two Purgers but she is rescued by her boss Darius before both are arrested by police for killing their attackers.Meanwhile, Juan and fellow migrant co-worker T.T. discover that the Tucker family has been taken hostage by their farmhands, who reveal themselves as Purgers intending to take the ranch for themselves.

In response, the Canadian and Mexican governments announce the early closure of its borders, leaving those who tried to cross it vulnerable to the Purgers. Fighting through El Paso, Adela and Cassie are split from the group by military forces while Juan, T.T., Dylan, and Harper are captured by the PPF, with their leader (referred to as ""Alpha"") offering Dylan and Harper a chance to live if they kill T.T. and Juan.

However, the military is forced to withdraw when their base is destroyed by more Purgers.Downtown, Adela protects Cassie from other Purgers, revealing that she and Juan had once been trained to fight against the Mexican drug cartel before they arrived to America. The survivors all reunite at a hidden safe-house for migrants run by a nearby Native American tribe. Their leader offers to transport everyone across the border as refugees. With the PPF in pursuit, Juan, Adela, and Dylan remain behind with other survivors to make time for the other refugees to escape.

Emily is mortally wounded during a Boer sniper attack on the camp. Before passing, she makes Orlando promise never to let their son see war again.Twelve years later, Orlando has formed a private spy network of domestic servants (including his servants, Shola and Polly) employed by the world's most powerful dignitaries. The network's primary goal is to protect the United Kingdom and the British Empire from the approaching Great War. Conrad is eager to fight, but Orlando forbids him to join the British Army and persuades Lord Kitchener, Secretary of State for War, not to let him do so.At Kitchener's request, Conrad and Orlando ride with Orlando's friends, Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria and his wife Sophie, Duchess of Hohenberg, through Sarajevo. Conrad saves the Archduke from a bomb thrown by Gavrilo Princip, a Young Bosnia rebel intent on sparking a war. Princip later re-encounters the Archduke's entourage by chance and fatally shoots him and his wife. Orlando learns that the assassination was orchestrated by ""The Flock"": a group plotting to pit the German, Russian, and British empires against each other. The Flock's headquarters is on an isolated clifftop, led by the mysterious ""Shepherd"", whose ultimate goal is to achieve Scottish independence; its operatives include Russian mystic Grigori Rasputin, trusted adviser to Tsar Nicholas of Russia.On the Shepherd's orders, Rasputin poisons Nicholas's young son Alexei, only to cure him when Nicholas promises to stay out of the war. Conrad is notified of Rasputin's manipulation by his cousin, Prince Felix Yusupov. Knowing the Western Front will be left vulnerable if Russia exits the war, Conrad delivers this information to Kitchener and his aide-de-camp Major Max Morton, who set sail for Russia. Their ship, HMS Hampshire, is torpedoed by a submarine and sunk. Word of Kitchener's death reaches Orlando, spurring him to travel to Russia with Shola, Polly, and Conrad to kill Rasputin.

King George V persuades Orlando to let him have Conrad assigned to London.

Disguised as Archie, a member of the Black Watch, Conrad volunteers for a mission into No-Man's Land to retrieve information from a British agent wounded there. He is mistaken for a German spy upon his return and shot, devastating Orlando, but the information he recovered verifies the authenticity of the Zimmermann Telegram.After Wilson again refuses to enter the war despite Conrad's proof, Orlando learns that Wilson is being blackmailed with footage of being seduced by the Shepherd's agent, Mata Hari, and resolves to recover the original negatives. Upon defeating Hari at the American embassy, Orlando has her cashmere wool scarf identified as made from a rare breed only found in a specific mountainous region.

Then, as Jean gradually loses favour with Count Pierre d'Alençon, Marguerite de Thibouville, Carrouges' beautiful wife, accuses Le Gris of raping her.

As a result, the interpretation of three distinct realities and three conflicting points of view culminates in a gruelling death match. But who will win the last duel?—Nick Riganas Chapter One: The truth according to Jean de Carrouges. After serving in the Caroline War, Jean de Carrouges and his friend, squire Jacques Le Gris swear fealty to Count Pierre d'Alençon, who has been named Jean's overlord by his cousin, King Charles VI. Jacques later informs Jean that Pierre has ordered his new vassals to pay war levies, agreeing to ask for leniency on Jean's behalf when de Carrouges explains he lacks the funds. To restore his finances, Jean marries Marguerite de Thibouville, receiving a large dowry and the rights to many valuable estates. Pierre, however, has already gifted one piece of land to Jacques. When Jean sues for the land to be given to him, King Charles dismisses the suit. Pierre retaliates by appointing Jacques to the captaincy of a fort that Jean's family had held for generations.

Knowing that Pierre protects Jacques, Jean resolves to challenge him to a duel to the death, a request which Charles VI grants.
Chapter Two: The truth according to Jacques Le Gris. Jacques wins Pierre's trust by using his knowledge of accounting to organize the count's finances, earning him a position at court. Upon meeting Marguerite, Jacques falls in love with her and becomes convinced that she loves him after she shows him kindness. While Jean is away, his mother takes the servants to help her with errands, leaving Marguerite alone. Jacques has his servant knock on the door, claiming his horse has thrown a shoe. She allows the man in, but he is followed quickly by Jacques, who sincerely declares his love for Marguerite. She insists she is married and orders them to leave. Instead, Jacques chases Marguerite up to her bedchamber and has rough sex with her, which he believes to be consensual. Before leaving, he advises her not to tell her husband. Sometime later, Pierre informs Jacques that Jean is accusing him of raping Marguerite. Despite the count's attempt to exert his authority, Jean appeals his case directly to King Charles and requests a duel to the death. Jacques accepts Jean's challenge.
Chapter Three: The truth according to Lady Marguerite de Thibouville. Marguerite and Jean's marriage becomes strained by her failure to become pregnant. After meeting Jacques, Marguerite informs her friends she showed him kindness only to try and win court favor. When Jean leaves for Scotland, he orders her not to leave the castle or let anyone inside. Jean's mother takes all the servants with her on an errand despite Jean's order. Jacques shows up with a servant who tricks Marguerite into letting them enter. Jacques haughtily declares his love for Marguerite; He forces his way into their bedroom where he violently rapes Marguerite. When Marguerite's husband returns, she tells him what happened. Jean's mother later insists Marguerite drop her accusations (and abide any consequences), so her son might be spared court's judgment. At Jacques' trial, a now-pregnant Marguerite remains resolute that she is telling the truth. Charles VI grants Jean's request for a duel to the death. Marguerite confronts Jean for not telling her she would be burned alive if he failed. Marguerite gives birth to her son days before the duel is set to take place. The duel begins with Jean and Jacques jousting until both men lose their mounts and fight hand-to-hand. Jean is stabbed but eventually manages to pin down Jacques. He demands that Jacques confess or face damnation, but Jacques claims his innocence; Jean kills him. Jean basks in the glory of his victory while Marguerite follows quietly behind.
A textual epilogue reveals that Jean died fighting in the Crusades a few years later while Marguerite continued managing his estate and lived in peace for the remaining thirty years of her life, never marrying again."

Man of God depicts the trials and tribulations of Saint Nektarios of Aegina, as he bears the unjust hatred of his enemies while preaching the Word of God. Man of God brings to life the incredible true story of Saint Nectarios of Aegina, Greece. A priest of the common people, his humility annoyed the prideful orthodox clergy of the day.

In this exquisitely made film, relive Nectarios' inspiring devotion and perseverance as, despite the efforts of the religious establishment to discredit him and dismantle his good works over decades, he embraced humility and inspired thousands to become one of Greece's most renowned saints.—Wikipedia The ever-growing popularity of Saint Nektarios of Aegina (1846 - 1920), the then Metropolitan Bishop of Pentapolis, sparks jealousy in the ranks of the high-level orthodox priests in Alexandria. And for fear of becoming the next Patriarch of Alexandria, a portion of the clergy embarks on a systematic smear campaign against Nektarios, bent on driving him out of Egypt. As a result, Nektarios relocates to Athens, Greece, where he touches the hearts of the needy and dedicates himself to teaching and writing. However, the unrelenting workload takes a toll on Nektarios' fragile health, forcing him to retire to Aegina, where he establishes a monastery. As Saint Nektarios falls foul of the system once more, accused of immorality, his health deteriorates, and he ends up in Aretaieion Hospital, Athens. But there, a posthumous final miracle awaits an unexpected believer.—Nick Riganas"

As a result, she has him incarcerated in a remote Russian prison in the same cell as Booth.Shortly after their arrival, they are brought to Black where she proposes to Booth that they work together to find the third egg, revealing to Hartley that Booth had lied and does in fact know of it's whereabouts. Booth declines her modest offer, and she departs stating she'll find the second egg then she will come back and his share will be less when she does. Hartley then suggests to Booth that they work together to beat Black, noting that if Booth helps him imprison Black then Booth will take her place as the number one art thief in the world.The pair escapes from prison and heads to Valencia where they plan to steal the second egg, which is in the possession of notorious arms dealer Sotto Voce (Diamantopoulos) who is holding a masquerade ball.

They torture Hartley and, believing Booth has divulged the whereabouts of the third egg, Black double-crosses Voce and leaves for Egypt where Booth claims the egg is. After leaving Valencia, Booth reveals to Hartley that the egg is in fact in Argentina, a location only he knows as it was inscribed on his late father's beloved watch which had once belonged to Adolf Hitler's personal art curator Rudolph Zeich.

Think again! Everyday life has a nasty tendency to bring you back down to earth. A year after the happy end of Monster Family, the Wishbone Family are struggling with their various shortcomings.

All the girls in his class are at least a head taller and make fun of him. Daughter Fay (Jessica Brown Findlay) has the feeling that all her friends are talented at something (singing, dancing, science) but she's not. Mum Emma (Emily Watson) tries to help her children, but her advice is at best ignored and more often than not seems to seriously annoy them. And then there's Dad Frank (Nick Frost) whose happiness in his new job and more relaxed lifestyle is ruined by seeing his family around him so unhappy.It's good news then that the wedding of the witch Baba Yaga (Catherine Tate) and the hunchbacked butler Renfield (both of whom have become part of the Wishbone's extended family as surrogate grandparents) will provide a much-needed distraction. What's not good news though is when seconds before they can exchange their vows, the two love birds are abducted by a girl who's the same age as Max! The girl is supercool Mila Starr (Emily Carey), the only child of billionaire, scientific genius, philanthropist, couple Marlene and Maddox Starr.

Fixated on the Swinging Sixties and all things fashion, creative, wide-eyed Eloise has big dreams of becoming a designer. With this in mind, the aspiring young couturier relocates to bustling London to study at the prestigious London College of Fashion, unaware that the big city can be ""a lot."" Indeed, as brilliance sparks jealousy and the ugly past creeps in, the frail bonds between reality and fantasy start to blur; suddenly, hair-raising visions threaten the dream. A fiercely-talented, effortlessly-seductive, and rapaciously ambitious persona bursting with confidence now emerges, luring ecstatic Eloise into a dazzling world of light and shadow. But success always comes at a price. Who knows what happened last night in Soho?—Nick Riganas Eloise, a fan of '60s music, fashion, and style, is a first-year fashion student in London, but is annoyed by her roommate's constant partying. She finds alternative accommodation at a bedsit in Soho. The arrangement works well, and in her dreams she is transported back to '60s Soho, where her alter ego Sandie is an aspiring singer. Initially this is something special which she anticipates each night, but the dream eventually becomes a sanity-threatening nightmare.—grantss The film starts as Eloise ""Ellie"" Turner (Thomasin McKenzie) is dancing in her room. She is an aspiring fashion designer who lives with her Granmother 'Gran Peggy' (Rita Tushingham) and has been mourning the death of her mother (Aimee Cassettari), who appears to Ellie in mirror reflections at times. Peggy shows Ellie a letter she has received informing her she has been accepted into a fashion school in London. Ellie is excited, but Peggy warns her that there are bad men up where she is going.Ellie takes a train to London and is driven to her room by a local taxi. The taxi driver (Colin Mace) makes creepy comments to Ellie, so she gets off at a shop and waits for the man to leave so she can keep walking to her room. She gets there and meets her roommate Jocasta (Synnove Karlsen).Ellie goes out with Jocasta and her friends, where it is revealed that Ellie's mother died by suicide after a struggle with mental illness. While in the ladies room, Ellie overhears Jocasta talking trash about her to the other girls. Ellie leaves the pub and walks back to her room, spotting an older man (Terence Stamp) looking her way and smirking. Jocasta later brings a guy back to her room to hook up with while Ellie tries to sleep. She leaves her room and finds a party going on outside. The only student to befriend her is a young man named John (Michael Ajao). The next morning, Ellie wakes up late and runs to class where she makes it on time for attendance.Ellie decides to find a place of her own for peace of mind. She finds a room in a boarding house kept by an old woman named Ms. Collins (Diana Rigg). She gives Ellie a set of rules to follow and allows her to stay in the bedroom upstairs. Ellie likes the place and rests for the night, sleeping all the way under the covers, enjoying the quiet.When Ellie gets out of bed, she finds herself somehow in the 1960's. She walks into a venue called Cafe de Paris and sees her reflection as another young woman named Sandie (Anya Taylor-Joy). Ellie follows Sandie as though she is there watching everything unfold like an invisible spirit. Sandie wants to be a singer at the venue but is met with unwanted attention by a surly patron (Paul Brightwell). She is told to speak to a man named Jack (Matt Smith) about being a singer. Sandie meets Jack and is charmed by him. He starts to leave with her when the patron makes rude comments. Jack punches him in the face and runs away with Sandie, kissing her in a phone booth, which is reflected as also happening with Ellie. As Ellie keeps moving, she finds Sandie in her bed, but when she tries to touch her, she wakes up back in the present.At school, Ellie becomes inspired to create a design based on what she saw Sandie wearing. Jocasta notes a hickey on Ellie's neck from where Jack had been kissing her/Sandie.Later that night, Ellie goes back to sleep hoping to wake up in the 60's again. She finds herself as Sandie and Jack get closer, and he brings Sandie to meet the owner of a different venue, the Rialto, so that she can sing for him, performing the song ""Downtown"". The men note that she can definitely sing.Back in the present, Ellie dyes her hair blonde like Sandie's and continues to work on her dress design, which her teacher seems to like, while Jocasta just mocks her out of pettiness. Ellie later sees the venue where she saw Sandie perform as it appears in the present day. She then goes to a pub to ask for a job. As she heads back to her room, the old man who saw her from the other night follows her and claims to recognize her because of her hair, but he insists he is not trying to pick her up.Ellie returns to the 60's and goes to the Rialto but finds Sandie is now performing as part of a group of skimpy-dressed women dancing as backup for a woman performing as a marionette. As Ellie follows Sandie around a little more, she sees that Jack is more abusive and is telling her that she has to make certain men happy if she wants to make it in the music business. Ellie sees Sandie in the bedroom as a lecherous man approaches her with his pants off. Ellie screams at the man to not touch Sandie, and he appears to hear her, but Ellie wakes up. The experience causes Ellie to rip up the pink dress design she originally drew in class.Ellie continues to get through work and school while keeping her excursions to the past a secret from everyone else. In her next trip to the 60's, she sees that Sandie is becoming more jaded and unhappy as Jack her forced her into prostitution and she must service a barrage of horrible men, while she also develops a drug and alcohol problem.

John takes Ellie home when he sees her looking bad. They start to kiss and go to her room for sex, but Ellie looks up and sees the ceiling mirror showing Jack attacking Sandie. Ellie starts yelling at him to get off her. She then appears to see Jack stabbing Sandie to death. Ms. Collins overhears the noise and orders John to leave, as one of her rules is not having male visitors. She simply tells Ellie to go to bed.The next day, Ellie apologizes to Ms. Collins about what happened. She asks her if anyone died in her room but Ms. Collins is dodgy about it. Later, Ellie goes to the library to look up murders in the 60's. She begins to hallucinate the ghost men following her around the library, nearly leading her to stab Jocasta in the face with a pair of scissors. John runs after Jocasta to explain things while Ellie leaves in a panic. She runs to the police station to report the murder, now believing that the old man is Jack and that he got away with killing Sandie, but the detectives know she has little to go off of.Ellie arrives late for work and finds that the old man is waiting for her. She takes out her mobile phone to try and record a confession out of him, but when she brings up Sandie, the man says ""Alex killed Sandie"" and that whatever happened to her was something she got herself into. Ellie runs after the man, but he gets hit by a car on the street and dies. Ellie's boss tells someone to call for help and say he's a former cop named Lindsay. Ellie realizes the man is not Jack, but rather the gentleman who was polite with her and didn't sleep with her.Ellie returns to her room and makes plans to go back home in the countryside to live with her grandmother. Ms. Collins gives Ellie tea and her mail. One letter is addressed to Ms. Collins, revealing her name to be Alexandra.... which is what Sandie told Jack her name was short for. Ms. Collins reveals that someone did die in Ellie's room: her. Ms. Collins was Sandie. After enduring all the abuse in her life, she let her life as Sandie die when she stabbed Jack to death. She later got revenge on all the men who abused her by murdering them. Ms. Collins then reveals that she poisoned Ellie's tea and will make it look like a suicide. John then comes looking for Ellie, who regains enough strength to warn John to run. Ms. Collins stabs him while Ellie tries to run upstairs, seeing the younger Sandie attacking her. Downstairs, a fire starts and begins spreading. Ellie locks herself in her room where the spirits of Sandie's victims break through the floors and walls, begging Ellie to kill Ms. Collins. When she finally breaks in, she sees her reflection as Sandie and realizes she has become just as much of a monster as the men who hurt her. She tries to slit her throat but Ellie stops her and tries to help her. Ms. Collins chooses to stay and die in the fire while letting Ellie go. Ellie gets John out of there as medics arrive, and Ms. Collins allows the flames to consume her.Sometime later, Ellie presents her work in a fashion show with Peggy and John in attendance to cheer her on along with the rest of the audience. Her teacher congratulates her, as do the other girls (excluding Jocasta who continues to remain a petty bitch), and she once again sees her mother's reflection smiling at her. As Peggy and John come to congratulate her, Ellie sees Sandie's reflection in the mirror waving at her."
Spiral,2021,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10342730/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A criminal mastermind unleashes a twisted form of justice in Spiral, the terrifying new chapter from the book of Saw. Working in the shadow of his father, an esteemed police veteran (Samuel L. Jackson), brash Detective Ezekiel ""Zeke"" Banks (Chris Rock) and his rookie partner (Max Minghella) take charge of a grisly investigation into murders that are eerily reminiscent of the city's gruesome past. Unwittingly entrapped in a deepening mystery, Zeke finds himself at the center of the killer's morbid game.—Lionsgate During a Fourth of July parade, an off-duty cop, Det. Marv Boswick, chases a thief down a sewer drainage pipe. Attacked from behind by a figure wearing a pig mask, Boswick wakes to find himself suspended by his tongue in an active subway tunnel and is given a choice via recorded message: tear out his tongue and live, or remain until the next train arrives, killing him. Unable to escape the trap in time, Boswick is run over by the train and killed. The next day, police chief Angie Garza assigns Det. Ezekiel ""Zeke"" Banks a new partner, idealistic rookie William Schenk. Banks and Schenk investigate Boswick's death and Banks realizes this to be similar to the now deceased Jigsaw Killer.Meanwhile, a homicide detective named Fitch - who several years prior had ignored a backup call from Banks, resulting in him nearly getting killed - is abducted and placed in a trap where he must rip his fingers off to avoid electrocution in a filling water basin; he also fails to escape and dies. Some officers begin to suspect that Banks may be responsible, due to his history with Fitch. A box then arrives at the station, containing a pig puppet and a piece of Schenk's tattooed skin inside. A small vial inside the box directs the police to a butcher shop, which was previously a hobby shop that Banks and his father, retired chief Marcus Banks, would go to. Upon arriving, the team discovers a tape recorder and a skinned corpse, identified as Schenk. Deciding to track down the killer himself, Marcus travels to a warehouse, where he is abducted. Shortly afterwards, Garza is kidnapped, and placed in a trap in the precinct's cold storage where she has to sever her spinal cord on a blade to stop hot wax flowing from a pipe onto her face; she manages to successfully do it but dies of her injuries, with her body found by Banks.While chasing a lead, Banks is captured and wakes up at the warehouse, handcuffed to a pipe with a hacksaw nearby. He considers sawing off his arm, but is able to escape using a loose bobby pin. He then discovers Pete, his former partner who was fired when Banks exposed a murder he committed, chained in place. In front of him is a large glass-crushing machine, which has been modified to hurl shrapnel at him at high speed; a tape recorder explains that Banks can choose to either free him or leave him to die. Although Banks attempts to save Pete, he dies from blood loss. Moving to another room, Banks then finds Schenk, who is revealed to have faked his own death by using the skinned corpse of the thief who lured Boswick into the tunnels, and has been the copycat all along. He explains that he is actually Emerson, the son of the person Pete murdered, who was shot because he had agreed to testify against a dirty cop. He also reveals that Marcus, during his time as chief, deliberately protected corrupt officers (including Garza) in order to ""clean"" the streets of crime more efficiently.Believing that Banks can be an ally, Emerson presents him with a final test, revealing Marcus restrained in the air and slowly being drained of blood. Emerson calls 9-1-1 and claims that he is a civilian being pursued by a shooter, resulting in the dispatcher sending a SWAT team to his location. He hands Banks a revolver with a single bullet, and offers him the choice to either use the last bullet to shoot a target that will save Marcus but allow Emerson to escape, or to kill Emerson and let his father bleed to death. Banks decides to shoot the target to save Marcus, causing his restraints to loosen and lowering him to the ground, and then begins to fight Emerson. Shortly after, the SWAT team arrives and inadvertently triggers a tripwire, causing Marcus's restraints to yank him upward again. A gun is revealed to be affixed to his arm as restraints pull it upward resulting in the SWAT team killing him. Banks screams in anguish as Emerson escapes."

But as they track the killer, Baxter is unaware that the investigation is dredging up echoes of Deke's past, uncovering disturbing secrets that could threaten more than his case. Yearning for closure, after the case that nearly broke him, the guilt-ridden Kern County deputy sheriff with the infallible instinct, Joe Deacon, once the pride of the Los Angeles Police Department, finds himself embroiled in a high-profile manhunt that has the entire city terrified. After two long months of fruitless efforts, six victims, no witnesses, no evidence, and the maniac still on the loose, Deacon's successor, the media-savvy lead detective, Jim Baxter, knows that, now, more than ever, he needs all the help he can get. And, more and more, this frenzied serial-killer hunt bears an uncanny resemblance to a cold case from five years earlier. But, how do you find redemption when the truth lies hidden in the little things?—Nick Riganas One night in 1990, a girl drives on a highway, stalked by a motorist. She pulls over at a gas station, where the motorist follows her. The gas station is closed and she is forced to run through the desert. She catches the attention of a passing truck driver, escaping from the pursuit.Some time later in Bakersfield, Kern County deputy sheriff Joe ""Deke"" Deacon is called to the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department to collect evidence pertaining to a recent murder. Deacon is a former L.A. Sheriff's detective and, for reasons later revealed, is disliked by most of the cops in L.A. One of the few people who seems happy to see him is Flo Dunigan, the coroner. Deacon still has a reputation for being a good detective and ends up going with recently appointed lead detective Jimmy Baxter to the scene of the latest in a string of murders that has been going on in L.A. Deacon notices similarities between the M.O. of the killing and the M.O. of an old serial murder case he was unable to solve.That night, a woman, named Ronda Rathbun, is followed by a car while jogging and is reported missing the following morning. Baxter learns from the precinct's captain, Farris, that Deacon got divorced and suffered a heart attack due to his obsession with the unsolved case. He's advised not to involve him any further but Deacon takes vacation leave to assist in solving Baxter's case.The next night, the police discover the body of another victim washed up beneath a bridge. Baxter learns the M.O. is consistent with the earlier murder and earlier killings: the victims were all prostitutes stabbed to death. Deacon begins investigating Albert Sparma, a suspect working at a repair store in proximity to the murders. Deacon tails Sparma. Sparma knows he is being followed and taunts Deacon by parking on the side of the highway right where one of the bodies was found. They bring Sparma in for questioning. Sparma mocks the detectives while under interrogation, and is released after provoking Deacon into an angry outburst. Also during this part of the movie the only person who has possibly seen the killer, the girl from the opening scene of the movie, is brought in to try and identify the killer but because she accidentally sees Sparma in the hallway her testimony is tainted and useless to the police.The FBI is called in to take charge of the investigation within the week, giving Deacon and Baxter less time. Farris informs Baxter that eight years prior, Sparma confessed to a murder which he couldn't have committed since he was ten miles away from it at the time. Also that he's obsessed with crime and is thus an unreliable suspect. Baxter and Deacon go to Sparma's apartment and conduct an illegal search. As Deacon searches the apartment and finds a hiding spot under the floorboards that contains newspaper clippings of the crimes they suspect Sparma of committing. A police scanner in the apartment alerts Deacon that police are on their way to the apartment and he escapes from Sparma's home after Sparma called in an ""officer down"". Police arrive and Deacon barely escapes. Baxter sees Sparma watching the escape. After an unsuccessful search of Sparma's apartment the two detectives tail Sparma to a strip club the following night. While Deacon gets coffee Sparma confronts Baxter alone. Baxter demands to know Rathbun's location. Sparma offers to drive him to where he supposedly hid Rathbun's body, and Baxter cautiously agrees. Sparma tries to leave without Deacon but he sees them in Sparma's car and follows in Deacons.Sparma takes Baxter to a remote area in the desert and has him dig several holes before admitting that he never killed anyone. Baxter is skeptical, and continues digging. Sparma begins to taunt him, until Baxter snaps and strikes him in the face with a shovel, killing him. As Deacon arrives, a flashback reveals that he accidentally shot one of the survivors of his last murder case, and that Farris and Dunigan, the coroner, helped cover it up. Deacon instructs Baxter to bury Sparma in the desert. Deacon spends the night collecting everything in Sparma's apartment and returns to the desert the following morning to find that Baxter has not buried Sparma and is still searching for the victim. Baxter is desperate to believe Sparma is the killer, hoping it will clear his conscience and close the case. Deacon advises him to forget about the case or it will haunt him for life.Later, at his home, Baxter receives an envelope sent by Deacon, containing a red barrette like the one Ronda Rathbun was wearing when she was abducted. Back in Kern County, Deacon burns everything he collected in the apartment, along with a brand new four-pack of barrettes that's missing a red barrette."

The Matrix Resurrections,2021,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10838180/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Return to a world of two realities: one, everyday life; the other, what lies behind it. To find out if his reality is a construct, to truly know himself, Mr. Anderson will have to choose to follow the white rabbit once more. Suffering from palpable delusions, burnt-out Thomas Anderson, the award-winning creator ofThe Matrix (1999)video game series, now relies on potent blue pills to keep his inner demons at bay. Then, amid inexplicable, reality-defying visions, Thomas spots Tiffany, a familiar-looking perfect stranger evoking strange emotions, and his already fragile mental state starts to deteriorate. As Mr Anderson yearns for an explanation while teetering on the brink of depression, once more, he confronts a pressing dilemma and the burden of choice. On the one hand, blissful ignorance guarantees the illusion of safety. On the other hand, the unbearable truth of reality can only mean one thing: the elaborate Matrix goes beyond the limits of imagination. But, somehow, Thomas already knows what he has to do. However, does he want to know how deep the rabbit hole goes?—Nick Riganas The Matrix is back, and Neo and Trinity must take on new forms of The Agents that have a stranglehold over the digital prison holding all of humanity hostage. Can The One save The Matrix from The Agents before it's too late? Only Neo and Trinity can save the day.—Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187 Within an isolated node of the Matrix, Bugs, the captain of the Mnemosyne, encounters a program running old code involving Trinity's discovery of Neo's location before Agents of the Matrix find her. Bugs finds one of the agents behaving strangely and discovers he is actually the embodiment of Morpheus and helps to free him from the node before it is erased. Thomas Anderson is a successful game developer, having created a trilogy of games based on his dreams of the Matrix, with the aid of his business partner Smith. He frequents a nearby coffee shop where he continues to encounter Tiffany, a married mother that reminds him of his dreams of Trinity. He has trouble separating dreams from reality, but his therapist consults him and provides him blue pills to help keep his sanity, though he later refuses to take it. He notices an intruder in one of his private instances of the game, but later finds that the instance had been deleted by Smith. Outside the Matrix, Bugs and Morpheus discover Neo's signal within the Matrix, despite the belief he had died. They connect Neo to Anderson, and realize he had been unconsciously running the node to allow Morpheus to be found. Bugs and her allies enter the Matrix to help locate Neo's body in the real world, and discover that Smith is Agent Smith, having been keeping close watch over Anderson's activities. Bugs helps Anderson to elude Smith and his new ability to take control over numerous individuals within the Matrix as a swarm. Bugs and Morpheus explain to Anderson what the Matrix is, and with his perception of reality already waning, Anderson agrees to be extracted. Neo wakes up in a pod, finding that a nearby pod contains Trinity, but machine entities, loyal to Bugs, recover him before he can free her. He is taken to the Mnemosyne and to the new human sanctuary of Io, where he is reintroduced to an elderly Niobe. Niobe explains sixty years had passed in the real world since the end of the Machine War, and the human survivors have allied with the machines to keep the system working against an Anomaly within it. Niobe takes Neo to meet Sati, an exile program he had previously met, who explains that the Anomaly was created after the Machine War and had somehow resurrected Neo and Trinity and kept them isolated from others. Though Neo wants to rescue Trinity, Sati warns that there could be consequences of this. Niobe orders Neo to remain outside the Matrix, but Bugs and others agree to defy her orders to try to help free Trinity. Coordinating activities in and outside the Matrix, Neo and Bugs enter the Matrix but are met by Smith and other exile programs would want to see the Matrix returned to its former self. While Bugs and her crew fight the Exiles, Neo faces against Smith, slowly recalling his previous abilities to bend the rules of reality within the Matrix. With Smith defeated, they take Neo to Tiffany's repair shop, but before Neo can talk to her, his therapist appears and slows down time. The therapist reveals himself to be the Analyst, a program that studies the human psyche but has since grown more powerful. He saw Neo and Trinity die at the end of the Machine War but created the resurrection pods as to study them more. Over countless iterations, he found that individually, the two were not special but when they worked as one, they had overpowered the system. Thus, the Analyst has been controlling the latest iteration of the Matrix as to keep the two near each other but preventing them from becoming close. As this has destabilized the Anomaly, the machines have prepared to reboot the Matrix again, but the Analyst has placed that on hold. He threatens to kill Trinity if Neo does not return to be reinserted in his pod. Neo and Bugs are forced to leave the Matrix when another ship loyal to Niobe brings the Mnemosyne back to Io. Neo pleads to Niobe to let him return to try to free Trinity again, and she eventually agrees. Within the Matrix, the Analyst invites Neo to a challenge, that if Trinity volunteers to go free of the Matrix, Neo can take her, but if she refuses, Neo will permanently return to the Matrix; Neo agrees. Trinity, as Tiffany, is brought to them and when the question is posed to her, her family appears. She initially seems to want to go with them, but soon rejects that reality and recognizes that she is Trinity. The Analyst prepare to kill them before Smith interferes, temporarily stopping the Analyst and giving time for Neo, Trinity, and the others to escape. Neo and Trinity race ahead to give Bugs and the others time to extract themselves, but the Analyst turns a swarm of controlled humans against them. The pair race into a skyscraper, and with nowhere else to go, the two jump with Neo expecting to be able to fly them away. Instead, Trinity has come to learn to fly and the two escape and regain control of the Matrix. In the aftermath, Neo and Trinity return to face the Analyst, assuring him that he will face dire consequences should he try to seize control of the Matrix again. Neo and Trinity both fly away to redesign the Matrix."

Now, the Nihilists' feared leader, Bathurst, seeks to end all life on Earth. Is Evan a part of the Infinites' master plan?

Kate Dibiasky (Jennifer Lawrence), an astronomy grad student, and her professor Dr. Randall Mindy (Leonardo DiCaprio) make an astounding discovery of a comet orbiting within the solar system. The problem - it's on a direct collision course with Earth. The other problem? No one really seems to care. Turns out warning mankind about a planet-killer the size of Mount Everest is an inconvenient fact to navigate. With the help of Dr. Oglethorpe (Rob Morgan), Kate and Randall embark on a media tour that takes them from the office of an indifferent President Orlean (Meryl Streep) and her sycophantic son and Chief of Staff, Jason (Jonah Hill), to the airwaves of The Daily Rip, an upbeat morning show hosted by Brie (Cate Blanchett) and Jack (Tyler Perry). With only six months until the comet makes impact, managing the 24-hour news cycle and gaining the attention of the social media obsessed public before it's too late proves shockingly comical - what will it take to get the world to just look up?.—Netflix Astronomy student Kate discovers the existence of an unidentified comet. Her professor, Dr Mindy, calculates that the trajectory of the asteroid crosses that of the Earth and that an impact will take place in about six months, killing all life in the process. They travel to the White House to present their findings. However The White House has other plans and are trying to silence Dr Mindy and Kate. In their attempt to inform the population through a television program, nothing really changes. Nobody seems interested and they will soon find out why.—Wiki With the enormous Dibiasky Comet hurtling towards an utterly unprotected Earth on a collision course of Apocalyptic proportions, Michigan State University astronomers Dr Mindy and his doctoral student Kate take their shocking findings to the White House. Having less than six short months until the unprecedented planet-killer tears through our atmosphere and obliterates all life on Earth, it's up to U.S. President Orlean and her apathetic staff to let the world know and, hopefully, save humankind. However, with the press more interested in celebrity scandals than facts and people refusing to accept science, this is easier said than done. But first things first. Do we know there even is a comet? Are we 100% sure that we are all going to die?—Nick Riganas Kate Dibiasky, an astronomy grad student at Michigan State University, discovers the existence of an unidentified comet. Her professor, Dr. Randall Mindy, calculates that the trajectory of the comet crosses that of the Earth and that an impact will take place in about six months, killing all life in the process. Accompanied by scholar Teddy Oglethorpe, Kate and Randall travel to the White House to present their findings, but are met with apathy from U.S. President Janie Orlean and her staff, including her son, Chief of Staff Jason. The attempt to inform the population through a television program also fails, though Kate's on-camera antics go viral online. When Orlean becomes involved in a sex scandal, she announces the threat of the comet to divert attention. The news is finally spread by the media and the launch of a spaceship that can hit and divert the comet, saving the planet, is announced. However, the operation is canceled mid-flight when Peter Isherwell, a tech billionaire and prominent funder of Orlean, discovers that the comet is composed of trillions of dollars worth of precious minerals that have become scarce on Earth. The White House plans to commercially exploit the comet by crushing it to reduce its size and recovering the fragments. Kate and Teddy immediately abandon the operation in protest, while Randall submissively becomes a prominent voice in advocating for the comet's commercial opportunities, as well as starting an affair with talk show host Brie Evantee. The world becomes ideologically divided between those who demand the total destruction of the comet, those who decry unjustified alarmism, and those who deny that a comet even exists. Meanwhile, Kate returns home to Michigan and begins a relationship with a boy named Yule. After his wife June discovers his infidelity, Randall becomes angered and voices his frustrations on live television, launching into a rant criticizing Orlean's administration for downplaying the impending apocalypse and questions humanity's indifference, before leaving the operation and reconciling with Kate. Orlean and Isherwell's plan to recover the comet's materials fails, leaving them, along with a group of wealthy Americans, to flee in a spaceship designed to find the nearest Earth-like planet. However, they accidentally leave Jason behind in the process. Before leaving, Orlean offers Randall a place on the ship, but he turns her down, choosing to spend his last moments in the company of Kate, his family, Yule, and Teddy. The comet finally hits the planet, killing everyone. In a mid-credits scene set twenty-two thousand years later, the presidential ship lands on a lush alien planet. Its passengers wake up from cryogenic sleep and take a look at the surrounding environment only to immediately be attacked and killed by the planet's wild animals. In a post-credits scene, Jason is shown to have survived the extinction of life on Earth, wondering if his mother is still coming back, and documents the aftermath on his phone."

He walks back with her to the waterbed store where she falls asleep. Gary contemplates groping her but decides against it.News reports come out that there is an oil embargo that is creating a gas crisis, which Alana says is in part thanks to the waterbeds, since they are made from vinyl, and vinyl is made from oil.

She says ""yes and no"", but they both cry over the fact that the guys in their life are jerks.Gary is at the opening of his pinball arcade, dealing with obnoxious kids and adults. He runs into Alana's friend and asks where she is. He runs to the campaign office to look for her but she is not there.

Pleasure,2021,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8550054/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Bella Cherry arrives in Los Angeles with dreams of becoming an adult film star, but she soon learns that fame won't come easy as she harnesses her ambition and cunning to rise to the top of this mesmerizing and singular world. Ninja Thyberg's debut feature PLEASURE is a journey into the American porn industry and follows 19-year-old Bella from Sweden, who arrives in Los Angeles with the dream of becoming the next big porn star. The film is raw but offers both a human and humorous portrayal of a male-dominated world seen from a female perspective.—European Film Awards Armed with a clear vision and a brazen plan to take the adult film industry by storm, determined and self-confident 19-year-old Linnéa leaves behind her small Swedish town for a career in Los Angeles. However, in a world where friendships are rare and pleasure is ephemeral, Linnéa is about to witness first-hand the high cost of fame and success. How low is Linnéa willing to go?—Nick Riganas 20-year-old Linnéa (Sofia Kappel), working under the stage name ""Bella Cherry"", is a naive, confident girl from a small town in Sweden who emigrates to Los Angeles to become the next big porn star. Under the guidance of her manager Mike (Jason Toler), she begins to navigate the challenging world of the porn industry, and is determined to land more significant roles and video views by pushing herself to ignore personal boundaries and limits. She gets paid USD 900 per shoot.
Bella shares a house with a group of other young actresses (Including Ashley (Dana DeArmond)) attempting to become famous, and though she is standoffish and private at first, she eventually bonds with one of her housemates, Joy (Revika Anne Reustle), who supports her and helps Bella build her brand. At a party, the girls spot Mark Spiegler, one of the most successful and demanding managers in the porn industry; he is joined by Ava (Evelyn Claire), one of the biggest names in the local porn scene. Bella attempts to start a conversation with Ava, who ignores her. Joy tries to flirt with a famous male actor, Caesar (Lance Hart), but when he cruelly rejects her, she retaliates by pushing him into the pool.
Bella calls Mark and asks him to sign her up. But Mark tells her that she has a really small social media profile, and Bella is just getting started. He tells her to build her profile a lot further.Bella works on several shoots, including a BDSM scene with a female director who encourages Bella in positive, healthy ways, enforcing safety and consent on the set. However, Bella is determined to push herself further, and she requests hardcore scenes from her manager. While filming a rape scene with two male actors, she becomes overwhelmed and breaks down, repeatedly interrupting filming. Initially, her co-stars and the director seem encouraging, but they quickly grow hostile and dismissive when she struggles to finish the scene. Bella reluctantly agrees to complete the shoot and later confronts her manager, who reminds her that she requested harder material. Upset, Bella fires him as her manager.Now working independently, Bella attempts to acquire Spiegler as her new manager, but he turns her down, saying she has a weak social media following and insisting he only accepts actresses willing to do extreme scenes. In order to prove herself, Bella participates in an interracial threesome, which includes a first-ever ""interracial, double anal penetration"", boosting her following considerably. Spiegler is impressed, and agrees to hire Bella. As a way to repay her friend, Bella requests that Joy be part of her next scene. Joy is initially thrilled, but hesitates when the lead actor withdraws at the last minute, and is replaced by Caesar. Bella implores Joy to go through with the shoot, but soon observes Caesar harassing Joy off-camera. During the scene, which involves degradation and humiliation, Caesar begins to legitimately abuse Joy (by making her lick his shoes and digging his claws into her back), who stops the scene in anger. Joy insists to the director that Caesar is harming her, but when she asks Bella to confirm Caesar's earlier harassment, Bella, worried about her reputation, balks. Furious, Joy upbraids Bella for her betrayal and storms off the set.Bella is given a chance to film a scene with Ava, but Ava humiliates her when she refuses to perform oral sex on Bella, claiming she has a yeast infection. The scene is changed so that Bella will penetrate Ava with a strap-on, but Bella quickly lets her anger and frustration take over, acting violently and aggressively towards Ava without warning or consent, just as many of her male co-stars and directors did to her since her arrival. When Bella tries to apologize to Ava later en route to a party, Ava nonchalantly dismisses her as if nothing had bothered her, which disturbs Bella. Bella is further disillusioned when she spots her old housemates at the party, all of whom are enjoying their time at the party opposite of Bella who is essentially now locked in the VIP area. On the ride back from the party, Bella abruptly asks the car to stop so that she can get out."
The French Dispatch,2021,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8847712/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A love letter to journalists set in an outpost of an American newspaper in a fictional twentieth century French city that brings to life a collection of stories published in ""The French Dispatch Magazine"". Faced with the impending dissolution of The French Dispatch, a factual weekly report on various subjects, old-school editor-in-chief Arthur Howitzer Jr. assembles the crème de la crème of the magazine's loyal expatriate journalists for one final issue. And against the backdrop of picturesque Ennui-sur-Blasé, Paris, France, three feature articles unfold. The vignettes pivot around tormented genius artists, statuesque prison officers, flamboyant critics, moody idealists, conflicted ace reporters, legendary chefs and, of course, the police.—Nick Riganas The film consists of: An obituary (of editor-in-chief Arthur Howitzer, Jr.), a brief travel-guide ('The Cycling Reporter' by Herbsaint Sazerac; a bicycle tour of Ennui-sur-Blasé), and three feature articles ('The Concrete Masterpiece' by J.K.L. Berensen, 'Revisions to a Manifesto' by Lucinda Krementz, and 'The Private Dining Room of the Police Commissioner' by Roebuck Wright) all from The French Dispatch (an American magazine published in Ennui, France).—Peter Brandt Nielsen The film begins with the narrated obituary of Arthur Howitzer Jr., the editor of the magazine The French Dispatch, who has died suddenly of a heart attack. According to the wishes expressed in his will, publication of the magazine is immediately suspended. A scene shows Howitzer and his editorial staff discussing the publication of the following four magazine pieces.The Cycling ReporterHerbsaint Sazerac delivers a cycling tour of the town of Ennui-sur-Blasé, demonstrating several key areas such as the arcade, Le Sans Blague café and a pick-pocket's alleyway. He compares the past and the present of each place, demonstrating how much and yet how little has changed in Ennui over time.The Concrete MasterpieceJ.K.L. Berensen delivers a lecture at the art gallery of her former employer, Upshur ""Maw"" Clampette, in which she details the career of Moses Rosenthaler. Rosenthaler, a mentally disturbed artist serving a sentence in the Ennui prison for murder, paints an abstract nude portrait of Simone, a prison officer with whom he develops a burgeoning relationship. Julien Cadazio, an art dealer also serving a sentence for tax evasion, is immediately taken by the painting and buys it despite Rosenthaler's protests. Upon his release, Cadazio convinces his family of art exhibitors to put it on display, and Rosenthaler soon becomes a sensation in the art world. Privately, Rosenthaler struggles with inspiration, and devotes himself to a long-term project.Three years later, Cadazio, his uncles, Clampette, Berensen, and a mob of artists inspired by Rosenthaler, all frustrated at the lack of further paintings, bribe their way into the prison to confront him, only to discover that his masterpiece is in fact a series of frescoes in the concrete prison hall. Angered that the paintings are irremovable from the prison, Cadazio gets into a physical altercation with Rosenthaler, but soon comes to appreciate the paintings for what they are, and later arranges for the entire room to be airlifted out of the prison into a private museum in Kansas, owned by Clampette. For his actions in halting a prison riot that breaks out during the reveal of the paintings, Rosenthaler is released on probation. Simone and Rosenthaler maintain correspondence following his release.Revisions to a ManifestoLucinda Krementz reports on a student protest breaking out in the streets of Ennui that soon boils over into the ""Chessboard Revolution"". While the revolution initially is inspired by petty concerns over access to the girls dormitory, the traumatic military conscription of one student, Mitch-Mitch, inspires greater uprising. The students' cause spreads to the working people of Ennui-sur-Blasé.Despite her insistence on maintaining ""journalistic neutrality"", Krementz has a brief romance with Zeffirelli, a self-styled leader of the revolt, and secretly helps him write his manifesto and adds an appendix. Juliette, a fellow revolutionary, is unimpressed with his manifesto. After they briefly express their disagreement about its contents, Krementz tells the two to ""go make love"", which they do.A few weeks later, Zeffirelli is killed attempting repairs on the tower of a revolutionary pirate radio station, and soon a photograph of his likeness becomes symbolic of the movement. Years later, Krementz adapts the story of Mitch-Mitch's conscription, and Zeffirelli and Juliette's relationship, for a play at the National Theatre.The Private Dining Room of the Police CommissionerDuring a television interview, Roebuck Wright recounts the story of his attending a private dinner with The Commissaire of the Ennui police force, prepared by legendary police officer/chef Lt. Nescaffier. Nescaffier is a famous specialist in a kind of haute cuisine specifically designed to be eaten by working police officers. The dinner is disrupted when the Commissaire's son Gigi is kidnapped and held for ransom by criminals, led by a failed musician called The Chauffeur.The kidnappers represent the warring criminal syndicates of Ennui-sur-Blasé, and demand the release of an underworld accountant called ""The Abacus"", who possesses their shared financial records. ""The Abacus"" is being held in a solitary confinement cell at police headquarters. Wright recollects his own imprisonment in that same cell for his homosexuality, for which he was bailed out by Howitzer and offered a job at the Dispatch.Following a shoot-out at the kidnapper's hideout, Gigi manages to sneak out a message in Morse code to ""send the cook"". Lt. Nescaffier is sent into the kidnappers' hideout, ostensibly to provide both them and Gigi with food, but secretly the food is laced with poison. The criminals all succumb to the poison, and Nescaffier just barely survives (due to his strong stomach) after being made to test it first, but The Chauffeur escapes with Gigi, and leads the police on a chase. Gigi manages to escape out of the sunroof and reunites with his father. During his recovery, Nescaffier saves ""The Abacus"" from starving to death by preparing him an omelette, the prisoner having been totally forgotten in the commotion.Back at the Dispatch office, Howitzer tells Wright to reinsert a deleted segment. In it, a recovering Nescaffier tells Wright that the taste of the poison was unlike anything he had ever eaten before, before they commiserate over the state of being foreigners in France. Howitzer and Wright disagree on whether this conversation is important.In an epilogue, the French Dispatch editorial staff mourn Howitzer's death and start to write his obituary for the final issue."

But before she can, her father traps her in the basement. A teen girl named Marie, who is having breathing difficulties is being cuddled by a woman in the back seat of a car and being rushed to a hospital by a male driver. After getting down at the hospital and while carrying the girl inside, the man warns the woman saying ""Not a word"".Next, we see a family eating at a table. Don and his wife Renee are raising two daughters Amy and Sara. Sara is rebellious and sneaks out to dance at a bonfire with her motorcycle-riding boyfriend. His name is Chris, and he also plays the guitar. He sings Sara a song and tells her that he loves her.When Sara comes home the next morning, Don is pissed and screams at his daughter. He says as long as she lives in his house, she will follow his rules. Sara makes plans with Amy and Renee to move out on her own when she becomes 18. Don overhears the conversation and preps his bomb shelter in the basement. He plans to lock his daughter inside so she can't leave him.While Renee is out shopping, Don asks Sara to help him move stuff in the basement. Then he locks her in and soundproofs the room. She is literally trapped in a bomb shelter and has no way out. The bin is full of clothing. We get a day counter. This is Day 1 of many, many, more to come.Sara is living like a caged animal. The keypad has three tries before shutting down the air circulation. Sara uses pots to piss in and takes every opportunity to scream for help and fight to be freed.

She thinks of Chris to get herself through the trauma she is experiencing. Ironically, Chris shows up to question Don about where Sara is. Don lies and says she ran off with another man named Stevie.Day 21 - Don goes downstairs, forces Sara to put on a red dress, gives her a birthday cake, and asks her what she wants. She says she want to be released, to which he says that it is too early. Then she asks for a TV, to which he says she has to earn it. Then she asks for a clock. He agrees and ask her to come closer. (Probably she gets raped again)Day 38 - The next time he comes down, she is ready and attacks him with a makeshift weapon. (A corned beef can lid attached to some wood.) But he easily avoids the attack and beats her and probably rapes her again.Fast Forward from Day 39 to Day 354- Sara is pregnant with her father's child/her sister.

Meanwhile Renee has some bonding time with grandson Thomas. Sara spends all night digging; she is also pregnant again. The hole leads to the front yard, and she flashes a light signaling a neighbor for help. When the neighbor goes to the front door and tells Don, he goes downstairs and beats his pregnant daughter, causing her to miscarry.18 Years in captivity, Don fills Sara in about her other son living just above them named Thomas. He uses Thomas to turn Marie and Michael against their mother. They demand to be let out, and Sara can't take it. She freaks out and collapses on the floor, crying.

Marie is asthmatic and has trouble breathing due to limited air supply in the basement.19 Years - Don comes down to the basement and has an argument with Sara about rationing food.

The Power of the Dog,2021,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10293406/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Charismatic rancher Phil Burbank inspires fear and awe in those around him. When his brother brings home a new wife and her son, Phil torments them until he finds himself exposed to the possibility of love. Severe, pale-eyed, handsome, Phil Burbank is brutally beguiling. All of Phil's romance, power and fragility is trapped in the past and in the land: He can castrate a bull calf with two swift slashes of his knife; he swims naked in the river, smearing his body with mud. He is a cowboy as raw as his hides. The year is 1925. The Burbank brothers are wealthy ranchers in Montana. At the Red Mill restaurant on their way to market, the brothers meet Rose, the widowed proprietress, and her impressionable son Peter. Phil behaves so cruelly he drives them both to tears, revelling in their hurt and rousing his fellow cowhands to laughter - all except his brother George, who comforts Rose then returns to marry her. As Phil swings between fury and cunning, his taunting of Rose takes an eerie form - he hovers at the edges of her vision, whistling a tune she can no longer play. His mockery of her son is more overt, amplified by the cheering of Phil's cowhand disciples. Then Phil appears to take the boy under his wing. Is this latest gesture a softening that leaves Phil exposed, or a plot twisting further into menace?—Netflix 1925 rural Montana. Harbouring a silent but discernible disagreement over everything, the polar opposite Burbank brothers--swaggering, boorish Phil and dapper, mild-mannered George--have been running the family's prosperous ranch for decades. Owing his charisma and unrelenting competence to his late mentor ""Bronco"" Henry, Phil takes great pleasure in bullying his soft-spoken sibling, utterly unaware that change is on its way. As a chance encounter with widowed lodging house owner Rose and her sensitive teenage son Peter leads to an unexpectedly profound bond, suddenly, mean Phil chooses to shift his focus away from his worries and concentrate on the quiet boy--an easy target. And, more and more, harassment and abuse pave the way for depression and alcoholism. But, sometimes, secrets hide in plain sight. Can a bloated, noxious ego lead to destruction?—Nick Riganas In 1925 Montana, wealthy ranch owner brothers Phil and George Burbank meet widow and inn owner Rose Gordon during a cattle drive. The gentle-mannered George is quickly taken with Rose, while the volatile Phil, much influenced by his late mentor ""Bronco"" Henry, mocks Rose's son Peter for his lisp and effeminate manner. George and Rose soon marry. Rose uses George's money to send her son to college to study medicine and surgery, while she moves into the Burbank ranch house. Phil immediately takes a dislike to her, believing she took advantage of George for his wealth. His rough ways and taunting manner unnerve her. George organizes a dinner party with his parents and the governor so they can meet Rose and hear her play their new piano. Phil, after being asked by George to wash up before dinner, is nowhere to be found. Rose is very reluctant to play the piano, citing her lack of ability, but is pressured to do so by George and their guests. She is unable to play more than a few notes and is further humiliated when Phil, still dirty, enters and mentions all her practicing. As they leave, she takes a drink of alcohol, something she was previously opposed to. By the time Peter comes to stay at the ranch for the summer break, Rose has become an alcoholic, which she hides from George. Phil and his men taunt Peter, and he sequesters himself in his room, dissecting animals and studying diseases. In a secluded glade, Phil lies on the ground with Bronco Henry's handkerchief, draping it over his face. Peter enters the glade and finds a stash of magazines with Bronco Henry's name on them depicting nude men. He observes Phil bathing in a pond with the kerchief around his neck; Phil notices him and chases him off. Phil suddenly begins to show decency to Peter, offering to plait him a lasso from rawhide and teach him how to ride a horse. Phil is impressed when Peter immediately picks out a shadow in the shape of a dog on a nearby mountain. Peter, out on a solo ride, comes across a diseased cattle carcass and cuts into its hide with a scalpel. Out on a fencing job, Peter and Phil corner and kill a rabbit, and Phil gets an open wound on his hand. Afterwards, Peter tells Phil about finding the body of his father, who had hanged himself. Seeing how much time her son is spending with Phil, Rose's alcoholism worsens. Upon learning about Phil's policy of burning the hides he does not need for himself, Rose defiantly gives them to local Indigenous traders who thank her with a pair of gloves. She then collapses from her rapid alcohol consumption and George tends to her. With no hides to finish Peter's lasso, Phil is despondent until Peter offers him the hide he cut from the dead cattle. They spend the night in the barn finishing it, and Phil tells Peter a story of how Bronco Henry saved his life by combining their body heat in freezing weather and does not answer when Peter asks if they were naked and they then seductively share a cigarette. When Phil does not show up for breakfast the next morning, George finds him sickened in bed and his wound heavily infected. A delirious Phil looks for Peter to give him the finished lasso but George takes him away to the hospital before he can hand it over. In the next scene, George is seen picking out a coffin while Phil's body is prepared for burial. At his funeral, a doctor tells George that Phil most likely died from anthrax, puzzling him, as Phil was always careful to avoid diseased cattle. Having not gone to the funeral, Peter opens a Book of Common Prayer to the burial rite and then flips to the Psalter and reads Psalm 22:20: ""Deliver my soul from the sword; my darling from the power of the dog."" He puts his finished lasso under his bed with gloved hands and watches George and a now sober Rose embrace, smiling, implying he intentionally gave Phil the diseased hide to save her life."

Dan, Muri and the female Whitespike are transported to a fortified oil rig close to Port Nelson, where the Jumplink is located.Dan and his daughter work on a toxin that can kill the captured female. They find a match for killing the aliens, just as they start to breach the base. As the Whitespikes attack the base, the formerly captive female spears Colonel Forester with one of her spikes. She plummets from the gantry and Dan follows her off just before he is transported back to the past with the toxin to mass produce it. Dan tries to give the toxin to the military so it can be sent back to the future, but learns that the Jumplink is offline, having been destroyed by the Whitespikes. The world has become chaotic with the news that the Jumplink is offline, foretelling the war was lost.While Dan brainstorms with his wife, Emmy, she deduces that the Whitespikes did not arrive in 2048, but came much earlier. Dan consults with Charlie and Martin, a high school student with an interest in volcanoes and they theorize that the Whitespikes have been on Earth since the Millennium Eruption in the year 946, and global warming caused their release when they thawed out and emerged from under the ice caps. Dan leads a mission to Russia with Charlie, Dorian, a few surviving future soldiers, and his estranged father James to prove his theory. The team finds a crashed alien ship at the Academy of Sciences Glacier on Komsomolets Island. They debate telling the world about the problem, but decide to end the threat right then and there. Once inside, they realize that the Whitespikes are not aliens themselves, but rather bio-engineered organisms possibly used as a planet-clearing weapon or cattle by another alien race. The team injects several of the dormant Whitespikes with the toxin; this kills those injected but wakes the others, and most of the team is killed. Terminally ill with cancer and wanting to die on his own terms, Dorian remains behind to blow up the ship with C-4 and the explosion kills all but one of the Whitespikes. Dan and his father track down the one female that has escaped, leaving them and Charlie as the team's only survivors.Content knowing that the war is averted and humanity is saved, Dan brings James home to meet his wife and daughter, determined not to make the same mistakes that Muri had warned him about from her future."
West Side Story,2021,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3581652/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"An adaptation of the 1957 musical, West Side Story explores forbidden love and the rivalry between the Jets and the Sharks, two teenage street gangs of different ethnic backgrounds. Manhattan, Upper West Side, 1957. Against the backdrop of the decaying tenements in the San Juan Hill neighbourhood and the constant threat of the wrecking ball, two warring gangs--tough Riff's Jets and swaggering Bernardo's Puerto Rican Sharks--fight for supremacy. Now, with a once-and-for-all, winner-takes-all rumble on the cards, an unexpected whirlwind romance at the high-school dance between former Jet brawler Tony and Bernardo's delicate little sister María sets the stage for an all-out turf war. But what's a gang without its territory? Above all, when the future is uncertain, what's hope without love?—Nick Riganas In 1957, the Jets are a gang of white youths that fight the Puerto Rican Sharks for control of San Juan Hill on Manhattan's Upper West Side. Officer Krupke (Brian d'Arcy James) and Lieutenant Schrank (Corey Stoll) break up the brief skirmish, telling the gangs that their conflict is pointless since the neighborhood will be imminently demolished to make way for Lincoln Center.
The gangs are too proud to care, and Jet leader Riff (Mike Faist) proposes a ""rumble"" (fight) between the two gangs. He approaches his friend Tony (Ansel Elgort), who is on parole, for help. Tony refuses, wishing to turn over a new leaf with the help of Valentina (Rita Moreno), the Puerto Rican owner of Doc's general store.Meanwhile, Maria (Rachel Zegler), Shark leader Bernardo's (David Alvarez) sister, is betrothed to his friend Chino (Josh Andrés Rivera) but yearns for independence. At a local dance, Tony and Maria meet and fall in love. The school organizer wanted a social experiment with whites and Puerto Ricans dancing with each other. But Riff and Bernardo were adamant to stick to racial lines. Tony comes in and finds Maria standing alone on the side, as Chico cant dance (he is a boxer). TOny and Maria find each other on the dance floor. They share a private dance behind the stadium seats.This angers Bernardo, who agrees to Riff's terms for a rumble if Tony attends. The date is the following day, midnight. no weapons likes knives or guns are allowed. Tony voices his love for Maria and the couple meets on Maria's fire escape, promising to see each other the next day.Bernardo and his girlfriend Anita (Ariana DeBose) feud over life in New York compared to Puerto Rico, with Anita believing in the American Dream in spite of the pessimistic Bernardo (Anita wants to have a career and a life in the US, while Bernardo wants 6 kids and wants to return to Puerto Rico). The police interrogate the Jets about the rumble, but they deny any knowledge. Tony takes Maria on a date to the Cloisters in Upper Manhattan. He reveals he was imprisoned for a year after he nearly beat a rival gang member to death, which scared him into reforming. Maria makes Tony promise to stop the rumble, and they pledge their love to one another. Tony knows they cant be together till the rumbles continue. Tony tries to convince Riff to call off the rumble by stealing his newly-bought gun, but the Jets steal it back. Schrank orders Krupke and the police to stop the rumble.Despite their and Tony's efforts (Tony tells Bernardo that he apologizes for offending him and he has nothing to worry about with regards to Maria. Bernardo attacks Tony and the rumble starts between the assembled gangs), the rumble continues and Bernardo fatally stabs Riff. Tony, in a fit of rage, stabs Bernardo and kills him. The gangs flee when the police arrive, while Chino finds Riff's gun.Maria gushes about her love for Tony at work (she works as a janitor at a department store, cleaning the store at night, when it is empty), but Chino arrives and reveals Tony killed Bernardo. Maria is distraught, but meeting Tony later she refuses to let him turn himself in as it would mean losing him as well, and they plot to run away together. Valentina (Tony's employer and a maternal figure in his life. Valentina is herself a Puetro Rican and the runs a pharmacy after the Doc's death) learns of Bernardo's death and reflects on her interracial relationship with the late Doc. Meanwhile, Chino plots to kill Tony against the Sharks' protests (as this will only increase the cycle of violence).After identifying Bernardo's body at the morgue, Anita returns home to see Maria with Tony as he leaves the apartment. Anita argues with Maria but accepts that she and Tony are in love. While Schrank interrogates Maria about Tony's whereabouts, she sends Anita to warn TOny about Chino. However, Anita encounters the Jets (who know that Chino has Riff's gun and is hunting for Tony), who shout racial slurs and attempt to sexually assault her, but Valentina intervenes. Traumatized, Anita spitefully claims Chino killed Maria and vows to return to Puerto Rico, giving up all hope on her American dream. Valentina condemns the Jets, who disperse in shame.Valentina informs Tony of Anita's claims, and he runs into the streets begging for Chino to kill him. Maria arrives to his relief, but Chino emerges and shoots Tony; he dies in Maria's arms. Maria takes the gun and aims it at the gathered Jets and Sharks, berating them for the senseless deaths their conflict caused, before tearfully dropping the gun. As the police arrive to arrest Chino, the gangs assemble together to take Tony's body and carry it into Doc's with Maria following."

The film takes place over the course of a single morning in a 911 dispatch call center. Call operator Joe Baylor (Gyllenhaal) tries to save a caller in grave danger-but he soon discovers that nothing is as it seems, and facing the truth is the only way out. Joe Baylor, a demoted LAPD officer struggling to keep his inner demons at bay, finds himself embroiled in a white-knuckle roller-coaster ride when he receives a phone call from a distressed female caller. And as Baylor gives his all to piece together the information, the troubled 911 dispatcher soon becomes obsessed with saving the woman on the other end of the receiver in a race against time. Now, there's no turning back. But can Joe's unprofessional approach solve the time-sensitive situation before it's too late?—Nick Riganas Extremely stressed LAPD officer Joe Baylor is working the night shift at a 911 call center, which is overwhelmed with calls relating to a large wildfire in the Hollywood Hills. He is awaiting a hearing for an unspecified incident that occurred on duty eight months ago but hopes to return to his beat afterwards. Joe fields the emergency phone calls while being hounded by a Los Angeles Times reporter asking for a statement about the hearing.
Emily Lighton calls, a young woman who cannot talk freely, and Joe deduces she has been kidnapped and is in a vehicle with her abductor. Learning they are in a white van on the freeway, the driver catches on and Emily has to hang up before providing any further details. Joe relays the information to the CHP, but they are unable to locate the van without more info. He then calls Emily's home phone number, speaking to her young daughter Abby. She tells him her mom was taken by her ex-husband Henry Fisher. Getting Henry's phone number from Abby, he uses it to get the van's license plate number. Relaying the plate number to the CHP, he then sends a LAPD patrol car to check on Abby and her baby brother Oliver. He also requests a search of Henry's apartment, but is denied due to the lack of a warrant.
Joe calls his estranged wife Jess, from whom he has been separated for six months, asking to speak to their daughter Paige, who is asleep. Jess will not agree to come to the hearing and asks Joe to stop calling. He then calls Henry, who has a record of assault, tells him he knows Emily is with him, demands to know where they are headed, but Henry hangs up. Next, Joe calls his ex-partner Rick, who is off-duty, and asks him to check Henry's house. Rick, meant to provide witness testimony at Joe's hearing, expresses concern that things won't go their way as federal agents have been talking to him.
Joe receives a panicked call from Abby and instructs her to open the door for two LAPD officers performing a wellness check. They see Abby has blood on her hands and that her brother Oliver - who she said was ""sleeping"" - is either gravely injured or dead. Rick breaks into Henry's apartment, finding piles of letters and documents. Joe asks him to find information that can help them deduce where Henry is going. Then he calls Emily and convinces her to pull the handbrake, but it fails to crash the van. He calls her back and learns that she is in the back of the van. She tells Joe that she believed Oliver had ""snakes in his stomach"" and that she ""took them out"". When Henry stops the van and tries to remove Emily from the back, she hits him with a brick and runs away.
Rick then calls Joe back and says he found papers in Henry's apartment relating to a psychiatric treatment facility in San Bernardino, where Emily had been a patient. Joe calls Henry, who was taking Emily back to the facility; she had been off her medication for weeks because they could not afford them. When asked why he didn't call the police when Emily hurt Oliver; Henry says he doesn't trust the system as no one was willing to help them before. Joe asks where Emily went, but Henry doesn't know.
Emily calls Joe back from an overpass, implying she is preparing to jump to her death, having realized what she did. He directs the CHP to her location as he talks her down from the bridge. To distract her, Joe reveals that he killed a man while on active duty; when Emily asks why, he says he doesn't know but that he was angry and wanted to punish the man for hurting someone. She asks if it was ""snakes"", and he agrees. Profoundly distraught, Joe tells Emily that her family still loves her and needs her and that he promised Abby she would come home. As officers arrive, Emily says she is ""gonna go be with Oliver"" and hangs up. Joe thinks she has jumped, but the CHP calls to tell him they got her to come down safely. He also learns that Oliver is alive and in the ICU at the hospital.
In the restroom, Joe vomits. He calls Rick, asking him to recant his earlier story and tell the truth on the witness stand even though it means a sentence of years in prison. Joe then calls the L.A. Times, informing the reporter he intends to plead guilty to manslaughter at the trial."

After nearly losing her life in a horrible car accident, Alexia has been living with a high-purity, medical-grade titanium alloy implant firmly fixed to her skull. And ten challenging years after her extensive cranioplasty, Alexia is now a silently violent go-go dancer at underground automotive shows. But life is unpredictable--instead of being put off by cars, Alexia has developed a bizarre fetishistic fascination with automobiles. In the meantime, as a spate of grisly homicides terrorises the city, fire chief Vincent unexpectedly reunites with his long-lost son, Adrien. But time changes people--after all, the boy has been missing for a decade. Without a doubt, everything has its time, and now it's time to draw the final curtain.

While there, Justine, one of her co-workers, flirts with her. One night, after a show, a male fan follows Alexia in the showroom's parking lot, declares his love to her and forcibly kisses her. She then brutally murders him using her large metal hairpin. As she returns to shower after getting the man's drool off her, Alexia hears a banging coming from the showroom. She finds the car she modeled with earlier and enters it naked. She eventually climaxes as she rubs herself inside the car, while it appears to turn on by itself.

Alexia becomes an apprentice at the station, under Vincent's supervision. As Vincent gives more responsibility to his ""son"" instead of the other experienced fire-fighters, one fire-fighter confronts Vincent about ""Adrien's"" identity. However, Vincent immediately shuts him down and tells him to never speak of his son.Vincent is a tortured middle-aged man who tries to preserve his strength by injecting steroids into his muscular, aging body, but he finds that he seems to be building an immunity to them. Alexia is gradually disturbed by his possessiveness and considers escaping from the fire station. However, after Vincent nearly overdoses on his steroids by injecting a used syringe he filled with air, she chooses to remain with him.Vincent's long-estranged ex-wife comes to see her ""son"" but soon stumbles on a now-heavily pregnant Alexia without her body taped down. She nevertheless keeps the secret for herself, not wishing to interfere with her ex-husband's delusion. At one point, Vincent accidentally uncovers Alexia's breasts after she showers. Despite this, he also covers for her and promises to keep caring for her.Alexia's body gradually breaks down, as tears in the skin of her stomach reveal new metal plates and she begins discharging what appears to be motor oil from her breasts and vagina. As her pregnancy finally comes to term, Alexia reveals her real name to Vincent. Vincent helps Alexia give birth, the titanium side of her skull splitting open on her final push. As Alexia lays dead, Vincent, in tears, holds the baby, whose spine appears to be made out of titanium, and tells it repeatedly, ""I'm here."""

Now, precisely one year after the fateful encounter with the formidable adversary, Sir Gawain embarks on a peril-laden quest into unknown, fable-ridden territories to keep his promise and prove his mettle. However, from this life-threatening mission, there is no turning back, and only death, or glory, awaits those who dare to challenge the pitiless, green-hued adjudicator of men.

The Lord kisses Gawain in turn for the Lady's actions, but Gawain does not give him the girdle. The Lord reveals that he has captured Gawain's fox, but releases it.Gawain reaches a stream where a boat is waiting. The fox impedes his way, imploring Gawain in a human voice to abandon the quest. Gawain refuses and takes the boat to the chapel, where the Green Knight is seated in hibernation. After waiting the night, the Green Knight awakens on Christmas morning. Finishing the game, the Knight swings the axe, but stops short twice as Gawain flinches. Before the third swing, Gawain flees and rushes back to Camelot.

Afterwords, Diane holds a difficult conversation with Charles, who rebuffs her concern over William and Harry's participation in a pheasant shoot the next day and advises her to develop a stronger sense of separation between her public and private lives.Charles privately arranges for Maggie to be sent to London and spreads rumors that she had planted the Boleyn book in Diana's room and made critical comments about her mental health; McGrady denies that she had done so when Diana questions him. Major Gregory attempts to encourage Diana to conform to the pressures of royal life by reminding her that the soldiers of the British Army die attempting to protect the interests of the Crown (and by extension her interests); Diana responds by stating that she never asked anyone to die for her.After imagining wounding herself with a pair of wire-cutters given to her by McGrady, Diana avoids the formal Christmas Day dinner, instead running to her childhood home and gaining access to it with the wire-cutters. Memories of her happier girlhood overtake her, and she dances from room to room while imagining her younger selves. She considers committing suicide by throwing herself down a flight of stairs, but the hallucination of Boleyn stops her. Instead, she rips apart her pearl necklace.Boxing DayDiana wakes up in her room to find that Maggie has been called back from London. The two travel to a nearby beach, where Diana talks about her mental and marital problems. Maggie responds by confessing that she is in love with Diana, which she politely rebuffs Maggie's advances.After bidding Maggie farewell, Diana goes to the pheasant shoot, walks out in front of the crowd of hunters, and announces that she is taking William and Harry to London, to which Charles reluctantly agrees. Diana bids farewell to McGrady and Major Gregory returns the Boleyn book to the library. As they drive away, Diana and her children sing along to the song ""All I Need Is a Miracle"" by Mike & the Mechanics, passing the scarecrow again, now dressed in one of Diana's outfits. They drive to London, where they pick up some Kentucky Fried Chicken and eat it by the River Thames. In the final shot, Diana looks across the river, uncertain of her future but no longer feeling burdened by royal responsibility."

Benedetta,2021,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6823148/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A 17th-century nun in Italy suffers from disturbing religious and erotic visions. She is assisted by a companion, and the relationship between the two women develops into a romantic love affair. Tuscany, Italy, 17th century. As the sinister threat of the Plague looms over Europe, sincerely devout 8-year-old novice Benedetta Carlini is brought into the Theatine Convent of the Mother of God in Pescia as a bride forJesus Christ. Eighteen years later, as ominous whispers of disputable miracles scandalise the cloistered sisters, a test of faith awaits the deeply pious Benedetta. This unexpected trial comes in the shape of bruised, abused, and earthly Bartolomea. Now, sin is at the gate. And under the vigilant eye of cynical Abbess Felicita, fleeting glimpses of the forbidden fruit invite tentative intimacy, ungovernable desires, and intense diabolical obsessions in. But few can wrestle with guilt and emerge unscathed. Is there an escape from sin when weak flesh is the enemy?—Nick Riganas A 17th-century nun (Efira) becomes entangled in a forbidden lesbian affair with a novice (Patakia). But it is Benedetta's shocking religious visions that threaten to shake the Church to its core. From legendary Dutch director Paul Verhoeven, the provocateur behind modern Hollywood classics Robocop, Total Recall and Basic Instinct, and who made a triumphant return to European production with 2006's Black Book and 2016's Elle. In 17th-century Pescia, Italy, a young Benedetta Carlini (Elena Plonka) is enrolled by her parents in a Theatine convent run by Abbess Felicita (Charlotte Rampling), to become a nun. 18 years later, while playing the Virgin Mary in a play, the adult Benedetta (Virginie Efira) has a vision of Jesus calling to her. One day, a young teenage peasant woman named Bartolomea (Daphné Patakia) seeks shelter in the convent from her abusive father. Benedetta is assigned to oversee Bartolomea's integration into convent life. That night, Bartolomea kisses Benedetta.Benedetta begins to have recurring visions of Jesus. After a particularly fraught vision, where a man whom she mistakes for Jesus saves her from being gang raped, Benedetta falls into a deep illness. Abbess Felicita assigns Bartolomea to look after her. Benedetta has another vision of Christ, asking her to undress and touch his hands. The next morning, she wakes up with stigmata on her palms and feet.An investigation ensues. Abbess Felicita is skeptical because Benedetta's stigmata appeared while she was asleep, not during prayer, and her forehead lacks the marks of a crown of thorns. Outside Felicita's chambers, Benedetta collapses. She then begins speaking in an angry male voice, castigating those who doubt her, as bleeding wounds appear on her forehead. Sister Christina (Louise Chevillotte), Felicita's daughter, suspects that Benedetta's wounds are self-inflicted, after spotting a nearby shard of pottery.Following a dispute between Felicita and local church leaders about the way popular interest in Benedetta's visions should be handled, Benedetta is elevated to the position of abbess in place of Felicita. Benedetta and Bartolomea move into Felicita's old quarters and they soon begin a sexual relationship. Later for sex, they use a dildo carved by Bartolomea out of Benedetta's wooden Virgin Mary statuette.In confession, Christina lies to the priest that she witnessed Benedetta inflicting her forehead wounds. The next day, the priest compels Christina to say her accusations publicly. When questioned by the priest, Felicita refutes Christina's claims because Christina has previously admitted to her that she did not actually see the wounds being self-inflicted. Benedetta, apparently possessed by the spirit of Jesus, orders Christina to flagellate herself. Felicita later observes Benedetta and Bartolomea having sex through a peephole in their chambers.Humiliated, Christina jumps to her death from the roof of the convent. As a plague begins to ravage the countryside, Benedetta has a vision that Pescia will be spared and orders the abbey closed to prevent infection. Felicita secretly travels to Florence to report Benedetta's sexual indiscretions to the local papal nuncio. Meanwhile, Benedetta suddenly dies of unknown causes.Shortly after Felicita returns to the abbey with the Nuncio (Lambert Wilson), Benedetta revives, saying that she was in heaven from her near-death experience and has seen the fates of all those present. The Nuncio, as representative of the Pope, opens a court of inquiry into Benedetta's conduct. Bartolomea initially denies any sexual involvement with Benedetta, but after being tortured by the Nuncio's men, she ultimately confesses the truth, leading the Nuncio to the wooden dildo hidden in a bible. He has Benedetta arrested; speaking in a male voice again, she lashes out at those who persecute her, announcing that the Nuncio will soon fall ill. The Nuncio discovers that Felicita has the plague and orders her condition to be hidden. Bartolomea is expelled from the abbey.In the town square, before she is to be executed by being burned alive, Benedetta reveals new stigmata and, speaking in a male voice, announces that the Angel of Death approaches. Felicita, revealing her disease, blames the Nuncio for bringing the plague to Pescia. Chaos ensues as the townspeople prevent the Nuncio's men from burning Benedetta at the stake. Bartolomea unties Benedetta, discovering a bloody potsherd at her feet. As the Nuncio is killed by an angry mob, Benedetta and Bartolomea flee from the town, and Felicita self-immolates herself on the bonfire lit for Benedetta's execution.In an abandoned stable outside of town, after spending the night with Bartolomea, Benedetta insists that she must return to the convent. Bartolomea begs her to stay and tries to get her to admit that she faked her stigmata, but Benedetta refuses and instead heads back towards Pescia.A title card reveals that Benedetta lived in the abbey until her death in 1661 at the age of 70, and that the plague spared Pescia."

The soldiers reluctantly release Buck, who orders all of them killed save for the youngest. Buck and his gang return to their home of Redwood, where Trudy has a saloon. The town is now run by Buck's former associate Wiley Escoe. Although left in charge by Buck, Esco has used the position for profit at the expense of the town.

The arrest was staged by Reeves and Love in order to hunt down Buck without involving Love's gang: Reeves is angry because Buck has been pardoned, and he knows Love wants revenge. Love's gang, however, accompanied by Fields and her friend Cuffee, suspecting a ruse, follow Love and Reeves and insist on joining.

During a lull, Pickett is shot in the back by Bill, who is subsequently killed by Cuffee. Love enters Buck's house, but finds Buck unwilling to defend himself. Instead, Buck tells him about his own parents: his outlaw father killed his mother after a long period of abuse, and then abandoned Buck when he was ten years old. Buck subsequently hunted his father down, finding he changed his ways and name, and reveals that his father was also Love's. While he killed his father in revenge, he says the real revenge was driving Love into an outlaw, and that he scarred Love's face so that he would recognize him when he saw him again.

Ultimately, Usnavi and the residents of the close-knit neighborhood get a dose of what it means to be home.—Broadway.com Lights up on Washington Heights...The scent of a cafecito caliente hangs in the air just outside of the 181st Street subway stop, where a kaleidoscope of dreams rallies this vibrant and tight-knit community. At the intersection of it all is the likable, magnetic bodega owner Usnavi (Anthony Ramos), who saves every penny from his daily grind as he hopes, imagines and sings about a better life. Dreaming of saving up enough money to return to his island and restore his late father's business in the Dominican Republic, bright-eyed Usnavi runs a bodega in the lively neighbourhood of Washington Heights, Manhattan, selling the best coffee in town. Until then, Usnavi vies for beautiful beautician Vanessa's attention, as his childhood friends, Benny and Nina, nurture dreams of their own, intent on helping the immigrant community of Washington Heights. But, these streets are made of music, and as the temperature rises, nothing can stand in the way of youthful, sun-kissed optimism. After all, there is no place like home.—Nick Riganas The film opens on a beach, as Usnavi (Ramos) tells a group of children the story of Washington Heights. He tells them about the concept of a sueñito, a little dream that everyone has. He begins the story in the middle of the summer in Washington Heights, introducing the main characters of the film: Abuela Claudia (Merediz), the aged matriarch of the neighborhood who took him in and raised him, Kevin Rosario (Smits), who runs the taxi company, the salon ladies Daniela (Rubin-Vega), Carla (Beatriz) and Cuca (Polanco), his younger cousin Sonny (Diaz), who he employs, Benny (Hawkins), who is employed by Kevin at the taxi company, and Vanessa (Barrera), who works at the salon and is Usnavi's love interest, as they each pass by his neighborhood bodega for their morning coffee before they carry on with their day (""In The Heights"").Alejandro, who runs the local law firm, stops by the bodega to inform Usnavi that his father's old business in the Dominican Republic has been put back up for sale and can be purchased, something Usnavi has always dreamed of buying and reviving; his sueñito. Meanwhile, Nina Rosario (Grace), Kevin's daughter, returns to the neighborhood from her first year at Stanford University. After a quick reunion with Benny (""Benny's Dispatch""), Usnavi, Sonny and Abuela, she goes to find her father, while dreading telling him of her plans to drop out, due to a combination of loneliness and financial troubles, in doing so letting her neighborhood down (""Breathe""). She meets her father and tells him that she would be unable to pay tuition fees in time, but he brushes her off, telling her not to worry.Elsewhere in the neighborhood, Daniela, Carla, Vanessa and Cuca work at the neighborhood salon, which will be moving soon to the Bronx due to rising rent. Nina arrives at the salon for a treatment, and they happily oblige, all the while gossiping about her and Vanessa's love interests (""No Me Diga""). The attention soon turns to her studies however, and she is forced to reveal that she has dropped out of university, and leaves. Vanessa, on her lunch break, goes to submit a rental application to pursue her sueñito of moving downtown to become a fashion designer (""It Won't Be Long Now""). However, she is unable to provide a good credit check and her application is rejected. Disappointed, she heads back to the neighborhood and drops by Usnavi's bodega, where Sonny manages to ask her out on the weekend, on Usnavi's behalf.Due to the summer heat, the entire neighborhood closes up shop early to head to the local pool. Just as Usnavi, Sonny, and Benny prepare to leave, Sonny receives a call that one of the lottery tickets the bodega has sold has won $96,000. They and the rest of the neighborhood begin to fantasize about achieving their own sueñitos with the money if they were the ones who won (""96,000""). Meanwhile, Mr. Piraguero (Miranda) laments how Mister Softee (Jackson) is stealing his business (""Piragua"").That weekend, Benny and Nina meet at the park to hang out, as they reminisce about their childhoods spent in the neighborhood. She expresses her doubts and her fears about her self-worth to Benny, but he reassures her that she is destined for greatness (""When You're Home""). Afterwards, Benny walks in on a meeting between Kevin and the dry-cleaner next door, who has tried to buy over the lot where Kevin's business is. Meanwhile, Usnavi goes to talk to Sonny's father about letting him go with him to the Dominican Republic, but Sonny's father informs him that he and Sonny are undocumented immigrants.That evening, Usnavi, Sonny, Abuela, and the salon ladies gather at Kevin and Nina's house for a dinner party. Later on, Benny arrives and questions Kevin about his earlier meeting with the dry cleaner, forcing Kevin to reveal his news: he called Stanford, and has sold the business to pay for Nina's tuition. Outraged that he went behind her back, Nina refuses the money and storms out, followed by Benny, as Kevin tells the rest of the guests to leave. Usnavi and Vanessa head to the club for their date, along with Benny and Nina. At the club, Usnavi is overly nervous and aloof, and Vanessa dances with other men to make him jealous. Usnavi finds his own partner and tries to make her jealous in turn (""The Club""). Suddenly, the power goes out in the neighborhood, and in the ensuing chaos, Vanessa and Usnavi get separated. Sonny and Graffiti Pete light up fireworks to illuminate the neighborhood, while Benny and Kevin return to the taxi company to direct cars and taxis. Vanessa and Usnavi find each other and argue about their date; Vanessa angrily rejects him and they both go home (""Blackout"").Nina and the salon ladies go to Usnavi's apartment, where they play bingo and revel in the fireworks. Abuela, lying in bed, reminisces about her childhood in Cuba, living in poverty, and how she and her mother came to New York, enduring hardships to be where she is today, as she passes away, her heart unable to take the summer heat (""Paciencia Y Fe""). Usnavi discovers her unresponsive and calls the emergency hotline, but it is too late. The entire neighborhood comes together to mourn her passing and sing her praises (""Alabanza"").At a neighborhood protest for DACA, Nina learns that Sonny cannot go to college as he is an undocumented immigrant. She resolves to go back to university to find a way for undocumented children like Sonny to find a pathway in life. She informs Kevin of her decision, and he happily tells her that she has surpassed him, and encourages her to pursue her goals, telling her to disregard anything negative people say about her.While clearing out the trash, Usnavi discovers Vanessa's rental application that she had thrown away. He visits Daniela as she is packing up and preparing to move her business, asking her to co-sign on Vanessa's application. Afterwards, disappointed with the block's negative attitudes over the blackout and Abuela's passing, Daniela rouses them into a celebration of their shared Latin culture, as the entire neighborhood joins in (""Carnaval Del Barrio""). Vanessa and Sonny express reservations, but Usnavi convinces them to let go of their worries and celebrate in the moment, as the blackout finally ends.A month later, Nina finishes packing to return to Stanford, and she and Benny agree to pursue a long-distance relationship. Benny reaffirms his faith in her, and promises to make his way over to California to be with her, as they finally kiss (""When The Sun Goes Down""). At the same time, as Usnavi finishes preparing to leave for the Dominican Republic the next day, he discovers that Abuela held the winning lottery ticket, and has passed it on to him. Just at that moment, Vanessa shows up and flirts with him, having found out that Usnavi convinced Daniela to co-sign on her lease, and bought him a bottle of champagne to thank him. She quietly suggests that Usnavi should stay, but he refuses. Distraught, she finally kisses him, and laments that she was too late in realizing her feelings for him (""Champagne"").Afterwards, Usnavi visits Alejandro and Sonny, giving him the winning ticket and telling him to use it for Sonny's legal fees as he applies for documentation. The next morning, Usnavi walks around the neighborhood one last time, and runs into Vanessa. She takes him to his old bodega and shows him a new fashion line she created the previous night, having been inspired by Graffiti Pete's paint rags. Graffiti Pete has painted a mural across the wall of the beach where Usnavi's father's old business used to be, and another one celebrating Abuela Claudia and her famous motto, ""Paciencia y fe"" (Patience and Faith). Usnavi has an epiphany and tasks Sonny and Pete with telling the neighborhood of his decision to stay. The story returns to the present day, where the beach where Usnavi is telling his story is revealed to be the new shop that he and Vanessa built together, he is revealed to have married Vanessa, and one of the children is revealed to be Usnavi's daughter.The film ends with present-day Usnavi, Vanessa and their daughter dancing with the rest of the neighborhood, and past Usnavi accepting the neighborhood as his true home (""Finale"").In a post-credits scene, Piraguero is celebrating the overflow of customers now that the Mister Softee truck broke down, and gives the Mister Softee driver a piragua.

After listening to the narration of all events that happened until then from Sengeni, Chandru files a habeas corpus case in the court. The public attorney, in defence of the police, produces eye-witnesses to concoct a story that Rajakannu and the other two indeed absconded from jail. Finding gaps in the eye-witnesses' statements, Chandru uncovers that they were committing perjury and asks the court to investigate two police officers - Sub-Inspector Gurumurthy, a casteist cop and constable Veerasamy.Advocate general Ram Mohan takes over the case and in defence of the police, claims that the three accused have fled to Kerala when Varadarajulu, the employer of Iruttapan, acknowledges that Iruttapan informed him through a phone call that he fled to Kerala after committing robbery. In retort, Chandru manages to discover that the three cops in question went to Kerala to make a phone call to Varadarajulu which Gurumurthy admits, that he mimicked the voice of Iruttapan. Chandru and Mythra find Rajakannu dead in the middle of a road near the border of Pondicherry. Both believe that Rajakannu did not die due to a car accident, rather due to lock-up murder.Chandru consults the doctor who operated on Rajakannu.

Veerasamy confesses to Ram Mohan that Rajakannu died in lock up custody. Veerasamy called Guru after the death. Guru tells Veerasamy that he should stage that both escaped and leave Rajakannu on the road making everyone believe that he died due to a car accident. Mosakutty and Iruttapan were transferred to another jail in Kerala. After hearing this, the lawyer tells them to act like they do not know anything in court. Chandru checks the call history of the police station and tells the court that a call to Guru's residence was made at 9:10 pm, which does not match with Veerasamy's statement. Chandru asks the court for more time to investigate, which they allow.Chandru, Mythra, Sengeni and the Irular tribe go around the city protesting for justice. Chandru connects the dots and finds that Irutappan indeed called Varadarajulu, but the police coerced him to make the call. Mythra finds Iruttapan and Mosakutty and they tell the court about the torture all three of them went through and how the cops killed Rajakannu. Perumalsamy, an Inspector General, says the cops took a bribe from the real thief. Chandru also says that on the road where Rajakannu's corpse was found, there were a set of tyre marks. There were also footprints that matched Guru's and Constable Kiruba's footprints. After hearing these shreds of evidence, the court announces the verdict: the cops who killed Rajakannu should be arrested, Sengeni will get three lakhs and half a ground land as compensation while Iruttapan, Mosakutty and Pachaiamma get two lakhs each. Sengeni tearfully thanks Chandru for his help and Chandru attends the inauguration of Sengeni's new house, fulfilling Rajakannu's dream to get Sengeni a new house."

Based on the NY Times best-selling memoir ""Guantánamo Diary"" by Mohamedou Ould Slahi, this is the true story of Slahi's fight for freedom after being detained and imprisoned without charge by the U.S. Government for years. Alone and afraid, Slahi finds allies in defense attorney Nancy Hollander and her associate Teri Duncan who battle the U.S. government in a fight for justice that tests their commitment to the law and their client at every turn. Their controversial advocacy, along with evidence uncovered by a formidable military prosecutor, Lt. Colonel Stuart Couch, uncovers shocking truths and ultimately proves that the human spirit cannot be locked up.—STXfilms The real life story of Mauritanian nationalMohamedou Ould Slahi's detainment at Guantanamo Bay in the aftermath of the 911 attacks on suspicions that he was the mastermind recruiter for some of the 911 pilots is dramatized. In 2005 in a general writ of habeus corpus which allows the uncharged detainees at Guantanamo Bay to have their cases heard in light of not being charged, Albuquerque based law partnerNancy Hollanderis convinced at least to look at Slahi's case on the indirect request of his family back in Mauritania, who just learned of he being at Guantanamo Bay after he left home one day late in 2001 in volunteering to go with authorities not to be seen again. Hollander, choosing her junior colleagueTheresa Duncanin needing someone who speaks at least one of Slahi's languages, decides to take the pro bono case against the protestations of her law partners who believe the publicity of a being a ""terrorist lover"" will hurt the firm's reputation. Hollander and Duncan's mission to provide a legal defense is made all the more difficult in Slahi's overall suspicions, not so much of his two lawyers who he doesn't know from a hole in the wall regardless, but about information he provides being used against him while in Guantanamo. Their opposing counsel does not have any easier a task. He, Marine Corps officerStuart Couch, does have a personal vested interest in the case in knowing some who perished in 911 in direct actions by the terrorists that day, but he knows that his personal feelings need to be put aside for him to win the case based on the evidence. It is that evidence which the government is hesitating on providing and if the lawyers on both sides can get their hands on the materials may eventually dictate what happens with the case and Slahi's fate.—Huggo"

Boom! in front of an audience at New York Theatre Workshop, accompanied by friends Roger and Karessa Johnson. He describes an incessant ticking noise he hears in his head, and begins telling about the week leading up to his 30th birthday and his desire to become a successful musical theater composer (""30/90"").In 1990, Jonathan juggles work at the Moondance Diner in SoHo with preparing for a workshop at Playwrights Horizons of his musical Superbia, which he has been working on for eight years. He has a party at home with friends, including his former roommate Michael, who left acting for advertising, his girlfriend Susan, a dancer-turned-teacher, and fellow waiters Freddy and Carolyn (""Boho Days""). While alone later, Susan tells Jonathan about a teaching job at Jacob's Pillow and asks him to come too (""Green Green Dress"").Jonathan visits Michael at his new Upper East Side apartment, celebrating his financial success and higher quality of life from their old apartment (""No More""). Ira Weitzman, the Musical Theatre Program Director at Playwrights Horizons, asks Jonathan to write a new song for Superbia, as the story needs it. This troubles him, as his idol, Stephen Sondheim, told him the same at the ASCAP Workshop some years ago, but he can't come up with anything and he only has a week.Jonathan tries to get his agent, Rosa Stevens, to invite Sondheim to the workshop, but eventually just cold-calls Sondheim and others.

Heading to a swimming pool to cool off, he pictures sheet music lines on the pool floor and finally comes up with the new song, which he writes out by hand (""Swimming"").At the workshop are friends, family, and industry professionals, including Sondheim. Karessa brings down the house with the new song, ""Come to Your Senses"", and Jonathan imagines Susan singing it. He receives praise but no offers to produce Superbia. Rosa tells him he must keep writing, hoping that something will succeed, but he will likely face more rejection. Discouraged, Jonathan runs to Michael begging for a corporate job and perceived stability, but Michael changes his mind after seeing the workshop, encouraging Jonathan to continue in musical theater. When Jonathan accuses him of not understanding what it's like to be running out of time, Michael reveals he is HIV-positive (""Real Life""). Finally grasping his career obsession has cost him his relationship with Susan and jeopardized his friendship with Michael, Jonathan wanders through New York before finding himself at the Delacorte Theater in Central Park.

Susan gifts him blank sheet music paper to help in his career, promising to see ""the next one."" She narrates that the ""next one"" was Tick, Tick... Boom!, before he returned to working on a previous project, which became Rent. She reveals he died of an undiagnosed aortic aneurysm the night before Rent's premiere Off-Broadway. He never experienced the success he desired, but his work lives on. In 1992, Jonathan performs the final song from Tick, Tick...

Written and directed by Timo Tjahjanto
In Indonesia, a man wakes up to find his body gone and replaced by mechanical spider legs. He falls from his restraints and catches fire, which is soon extinguished by Dr. James Suhendra, a deranged scientist who desires to create a successful mechanical-human hybrid, using kidnapped humans as guinea pigs. He carries out a lobotomy on a young woman with the initials S.A. (referred to as 'Subject 99') using a circular saw, and sedates a restrained young man (referred to as 'Subject 98') after he wakes up early. Both experiments are successful; Subject 98 becomes a large robot with spring-powered blades for arms, and S.A. becomes a functioning cyborg that responds to speech. The rest of the tape is mostly presented from her point of view. James celebrates S.A.'s success as a news report states that a rash of recent disappearances are driving wedges between the police and the public. James is suspected of kidnapping his patients, and S.A.'s old self is shown onscreen; James remarks on how she still recognizes her old appearance.James attempts to wipe S.A.'s memories; S.A. wakes up during the procedure and hits James, before attempting to undo her restraints. James beats S.A. repeatedly with a metal tray, and her battery life drops before he is interrupted by a knock at the door; a team of heavily armored police officers have arrived to arrest James. James throws a blanket over S.A. as the officers break in as the tape cuts to the feed of Jono, the timid officer assigned with recording the raid. After the commander confirms that James is their suspect, the police shoot him dead, and begin hunting the lab for survivors. They discover S.A., and argue over whether she should be killed or kept alive as she is not classified as human anymore, despite technically being a survivor. A sudden blackout occurs in the lab, and Jono witnesses S.A. escape, but does not say anything.Another officer attempts to shoot the door lock and free the group, but triggers an explosion. As the group come to, an alarm begins to sound and James's contingency plan begins. Over a speaker, James states that his creation is his alone, and that those who try to take it from him shall die. Subject 98 awakens and slaughters most of the soldiers; Jono and the commander survive after the commander hurls a grenade at 98. S.A. comes to and flees through the building, being shot at by the surviving officers and chased by 98. She locks herself in a small office room and finds blueprints for her cyborg body and cannon arm, along with the upper half of her head and face preserved in a jar of formaldehyde. She approaches a mirror, and sees her new form for the first time; enraged, she punches the mirror and breaks it. After leaving the room and coming across more of James's failed experiments, S.A. finds and equips the cannon arm and fights her way through the building, slaughtering any soldiers she comes across in self-defense. She discovers Jono behind a door, and spares him after he begs for his life and promises to help her out of the lab. Suddenly, the commander appears and shoots S.A. before beating her; Jono grabs a gun and shoots the commander dead before being attacked by Subject 98. With her battery critically low, S.A. uses the last of her strength to tear out 98's brain, killing it. She collapses next to a heavily injured Jono, and her battery finally dies. The tape cuts to a security camera, which shows S.A. standing up on her own accord, escaping from the lab.Holy Hell (Interlude 3)

Written and directed by Ryan Prows
The First Patriots Movement Militia are a white supremacist extremist group that are currently plotting to blow up a local government building in a bid to ""take back America"". It is shown that they live in a well-secured compound in a deserted area somewhere in Detroit, Michigan. The compound has a room for security cameras, as well as a heavily protected small room covered in wooden crosses. In the latter room, a man is chained up and kept prisoner. Bob, the group's cameraman, Greg, the group leader, and Chuck, a group member, enter the room. The man pleads for his life, and Greg shoots him at point-blank range. The film cuts to one of the group's propaganda videos, where Greg explains that the group intends to purge evil from America.Members of the group set out in a car and drive past the building which they plan to blow up, surveying the site for security cameras and possible entry points. Back at the compound, Slater from the framing segment arrives to supply guns and ammunition to the group, asking if they have tested the ""creature"". It is shown that the group regularly shoot the man, who is revealed to be a vampire, and siphon his blood, which becomes explosive when exposed to sunlight, planning to use said blood instead of a bomb. Wanting to test if their plan works, they inject a rabbit with some of the vampire's blood and cage it; when the sun rises, the rabbit explodes. In celebration, the group drink heavily and party. Bob enters the compound and visits Steve, who is sitting in the security camera room. The pair visit the vampire's corpse, and Bob goads Steve into kissing it; the head falls forward and showers Steve in blood as Bob laughs.The next morning, an emergency bell rings and alerts the members of the group. Greg berates Jimmy, who was supposed to be on duty guarding the compound. Jimmy runs towards a body behind the truck, discovering it to be Terry, his neck having been badly gored. Suddenly, crashes come from inside the compound, and the group realizes they are missing Steve. Greg calls for Steve, just as a severed head is thrown out of the compound entrance as roars sound from inside. A member begins firing a truck-mounted machine gun on the compound, losing control due to the sway and killing some of the group in the process, and is shot in the head by Tom when he is unable to stop. Steve then stumbles out of the compound covered in the vampire's blood, promptly exploding once he steps into the daylight.The remaining members of the group - Greg, Tom, Bob and Jimmy - vow to kill the vampire. They enter the compound and discover the creature hiding in the attic; it tears Tom's face off and Greg shoots wildly at it. In the attic, the vampire kills Jimmy by slamming his head on the floor repeatedly, and Bob shoots at it, missing and shooting Greg in the leg. Bob is attacked by the vampire, dying after his face is bitten off. Greg, repeating the phrase ""Christ is king"" is dragged by the vampire into the cage. It then opens the attic window and lets in sunlight, causing the vampire to explode and the compound to be destroyed.Holy Hell (Epilogue)
The majority of the SWAT team are now dead, their eyes having been gouged out. Slater is tied to a chair by Petro and Nash, who rebuke him for supplying the militia in the previous video with guns. The women explain that they are members of the snuff/fetish film cult that has been operating out of the warehouse, where they create and distribute videotapes depicting animal cruelty, cannibalism and other shocking acts of violence. Slater is told that he will be their final kill for this video, whereupon Petro beats him to death with a video camera. As the film ends, Petro and Nash believe this will be their best tape yet, with the former wondering what to call it. (thanks to Wikipedia)"

As a result, the angry posse of dangerous lawman Ketchum is at their doorstep, demanding justice and the cryptic guest's head on a platter. Now, whether he likes it or not, Henry must pick sides. But first things first. Who is Old Henry, the fearless man with the opaque past?—Nick Riganas Widower Henry and his son Wyatt live on an average farm in Oklahoma Territory in 1906 near to Henry's brother-in-law Al, with Wyatt chafing at the simple existence of a farmer. After Henry and Wyatt find a lost horse with blood on the saddle, Henry goes to investigate and finds a near-dead man named Curry. Seeing that the man has a gunshot wound, a revolver and a satchel full of cash, he is hesitant at first, but decides to help Curry. He covers their tracks and brings Curry back to the farm, treating his injuries and removing the bullet. Henry uses the surgery as a chance to interrogate Curry, who claims to be a lawman and the sole survivor of a posse that confronted a gang of dangerous outlaws.Henry ties him up and goes to fetch a doctor, and in the meantime Wyatt sneaks into Henry's room and finds his cache of documents, as well as a fine revolver and some bullets. Wyatt takes Curry's gun and goes target shooting outside, allowing Curry to escape his bonds. Curry overpowers Wyatt, but Henry returns just in time to intervene and ties Curry up again.

They claim to be lawmen from Woods County and that Curry is the outlaw, but arouse Henry's suspicions when Ketchum begins asking questions about Henry's own identity and family. Henry does not give up Curry, and the men leave after a tense standoff. That evening, Henry has a conversation with Curry in which Curry reveals detailed knowledge of people known to Henry, which leads Henry to trust his claims and undo some of his restraints.

Returning to the house, Henry is about to bandage up the injured Curry when he spots a brand on Curry's arm.

Wyatt tries to help his father, but Henry tells him that it is too late.

In retaliation, the targeted new neighbors seek assistance from civil-rights attorney Charles Wright (Gregory Alan Williams). But Karen will go to any lengths, from trying to seduce Malik, to installing security cameras in front of her house, to meddling in their daily business by using the fact that she is the head of the local Homeowners Association, to getting Malik and Imani kicked out of a local restaurant, to faking being in danger to get the police involved.

The Vault,2021,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9742794/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Follows a genius engineering graduate who is interested in the Bank of Spain's safe. Thom, a genius engineering graduate, is interested in the Bank of Spain's safe. The Bank building is more than 100 years old, with no building blueprints available and a security system that includes an underground river that will flood the safe room if their walls are breached. As soon as Thom learns that a legendary lost treasure is going to be held at the bank's safe for just ten days, he devises, together with charismatic art dealer Walter ""Cunningham,"" a detailed plan to break in. They will only have 105 minutes to do so while the Bank's staff will be distracted, watching the 2010 Football World Cup final match, played by Spain's national football team and broadcast on a giant screen, coincidentally placed just in front of the Bank of Spain building. With the 2010 FIFA World Cup Final between the Netherlands and Spain only four days away, Thom, a brilliant young engineer who is treading water in his career, is approached by Walter Moreland, the grizzled owner of a salvage business. When Walter invites him to join his hand-picked band of robbers, surprisingly, Thom accepts, bent on bringing an impossible task to fruition: break into the impenetrable vault of the Bank of Spain, the most secure location in the world. Now, there is no turning back, and in their meticulously planned project every second counts. Can Walter's team pull off the heist of the century?—Nick Riganas Thom (Highmore) is a gifted engineering student at Cambridge University who is being courted by recruiters from several major oil companies, all promising him increasingly richer salaries and job perks if he agrees to work for them. Thom dismisses the offers, later explaining to his oil executive father over dinner that he does not want the life a career in big oil would bring him. During this conversation, he receives an anonymous text message from somebody observing him in the restaurant who tells him to meet at a club.He goes to the location he is instructed and meets a woman named Lorraine (Bergès-Frisbey), who then introduces him to Walter (Cunningham), who runs a salvaging company that had recovered a large treasure known as ""the treasure of Guadalupe"" but it was seized by the Spanish government because Walter's company was not legally salvaging the site.Walter has put together a team consisting members with various skill sets including Lorraine, a con artist, Simon (Tosar) a logistics expert, Klaus (Stein) a computer hacker, and James (Riley), Walter's longtime treasure-hunting partner. Walter needs Thom's engineering genius to help them breach the vault that holds the confiscated treasure inside the Bank of Spain. Thom agrees to help and joins them in Madrid during the 2010 World Cup as Spain is contending for the championship title. Using the crowd noise from the many fans gathered in the city to watch the matches as cover, they scout the bank and determine that the vault sits on a giant scale underneath a large water reservoir. If the weight on the scale fluctuates in the slightest, the vault floods, drowning any intruders who might be inside.Needing to find a solution before the finals, after which the crowd will disperse, Thom soon determines that they can defeat the scale by freezing it with 500 liters of nitrogen, slowing the mechanics of the scale long enough that it would not register their presence and trigger a flood while they retrieve the treasure.They move forward with their plan, with Simon successfully freezing the scale beneath the floor of the vault while Thom, Lorraine, and James perilously make their way inside. Thom's plan has worked but the scale begins thawing much quicker than expected, so the trio rush to find the item in the containers they are looking for: a collection of three coins from Sir Francis Drake that describe where to find his massive treasure hoard.As they locate the coins, Gustavo (Coronado), the head of bank security, has regained control of his systems after they were unknowingly penetrated by Klaus days earlier. Having learned in the days prior that the team had already infiltrated the bank to scout it, he dispatches a strike team to arrest the intruders. Believing they are compromised, Walter tells the trio to surrender to the team. James then pulls a gun on Thom, refusing to surrender, and demands Thom hand over the coins, revealing that he's working for the British government. The vault locks down trapping them inside, however, James' diving experience affords him the ability to swim to safety and he abandons the other two.Running out of time, Thom suspects that the key to stopping the flow of water into the vault is tricking the scale by adding more weight and making it think the vault is full of water. He instructs Simon to stack the empty nitrogen canisters onto the scale for additional weight, but it is not enough to halt the flow of water. The team loses contact with Thom and Lorraine, believing they have drowned, until as a last resort Simon himself climbs onto the scale with a radio broadcasting the world cup commentary, with the last bit of weight ceasing the water flow.The vault begins to drain, and Thom and Lorraine are able to evade the bank security and escape to the square where the fans watch Spain defeat the Netherlands for their first World Cup title.At the British Embassy, James has reported to Margaret (Janssen), an associate of both his and Walter's, and delivers the coins, only to find out that the coins are fakes and that Walter is still in possession of the originals. As the team relaxes in Saint Tropez, Walter discusses what their next task will be, which begins two years later as the 2012 Olympics begin in London.(copied from Wikipedia)"

Vacation Friends,2021,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3626476/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"An uptight couple makes friends with a rowdy couple while on vacation in Mexico, but their friendship takes an awkward turn when they get back home. In this raw and raunchy comedy, straight-laced Marcus and Emily (Lil Rel Howery, Yvonne Orji) are befriended by wild, thrill-seeking partiers Ron and Kyla (John Cena, Meredith Hagner) at a resort in Mexico. Living in the moment, the usually level-headed couple lets loose to enjoy a week of uninhibited fun and debauchery with their new ""vacation friends."" Months after their walk on the wild side, Marcus and Emily are horrified when Ron and Kyla show up uninvited at their wedding, creating chaos and proving that what happens on vacation, doesn't necessarily stay on vacation.—20th Century Studios The film opens as a couple, Marcus (Lil Rel Howery) and Emily (Yvonne Orji) arrive in Mexico for a romantic getaway. Marcus is a bit neurotic as he wants to propose to Emily and wants everything to go right. When they arrive at the hotel, they find their room has been flooded because the couple in the presidential suite above them overflowed their Jacuzzi.Marcus tries to get another room, but the concierge Maurillio (Carlos Santos) can only find them a crappy Best Western hotel room nearby. To make things worse, Maurillio lets it slip that Marcus was trying to propose. Left with no choice, Marcus proposes to Emily on the spot, and she accepts. Cheering them on is another couple, Ron (John Cena) and Kyla (Meredith Hagner), who happen to be the couple in the presidential suite. They invite Marcus and Emily to stay with them, and despite some reluctance, they go along with it.The two couples get together in the suite, where Ron and Kyla give Marcus and Emily margaritas. Only after they drink it do they learn that the ""salt"" around the rim of the glass was actually cocaine. Later, Marcus and Emily want to go on a whale watching tour, only to find that the boat for it is packed with tourists. Ron and Kyla invite them to go out on their own boat, so they head out and Ron lets Marcus steer the boat. Unfortunately, Marcus doesn't see rocks ahead of them and the boat flips over. The four are airlifted out of there, and while Marcus wants to repay Ron for the boat, he and Kyla thought the experience was awesome as opposed to regular old sailing.The couples spend the whole week hanging out and partying. On their last night there, the couples are out on the beach, where Ron feels that he has come to view Marcus as something of a best friend. Ron and Kyla then come up with the idea that Marcus and Emily should get married that night. They take the two to a cave where they meet a shaman that performs a Mayan ceremony to marry Marcus and Emily. Afterward, the two couples jump off the cliff into the ocean. They go back to the hotel room for more drugs and drinking, and Marcus passes out seeing Kyla on top of him, thanking him for the experience.The next morning, Marcus and Emily are super hungover and head over to the airport to catch their flight. When they arrive, Ron and Kyla are already there just hanging out, making inappropriate jokes about Marcus and Emily as security is nearby. Ron and Kyla want to continue seeing Marcus and Emily, and they ask if they can give them their numbers, but the latter couple pretends that their phones broke, so Ron gives Marcus his business card.Seven months later, Marcus and Emily are planning for their official wedding. Marcus, who manages a construction company, finds that his employees have gotten a suit for him. He laments not being able to invite them because Emily's parents want to keep it ""intimate"". When they arrive at the venue where the wedding will take place, Marcus is surprised to see that Emily's parents invited all of their family and other wealthy friends. Marcus has tension with her family because her father Harold (Robert Wisdom) doesn't particularly like him, and he also has issues with Emily's brother Gabe (Andrew Bachelor) because Marcus punched him in the face one time.Later that night, Ron and Kyla come crashing through the gate of the venue and pretend to angrily confront Marcus and Emily for not inviting them, before they burst out laughing at the gag. Harold approaches them, and Ron immediately wins him over by showing that he is a former Green Beret. Harold allows Ron and Kyla to stay in the one room that was available - the presidential suite. When Marcus and Emily ask them what they are doing there all of a sudden, Kyla reveals that she is pregnant, and they imply that Marcus had a big part to play in this, and based on what he remembers from the trip, he freaks out.The following morning, Harold invites Ron to join him and the others for a fox hunt, which doesn't actually involve hunting a fox, but rather chasing after one even though nobody has seen a fox around there in forever. Marcus and Ron go off together, where Ron shows Marcus which items to forage for food. Meanwhile, Harold expresses to Emily and Kyla that he didn't get along with his own father-in-law, and Emily notes the same thing is happening with him and Marcus. When the guys get to a special mushroom, Marcus eats it before Ron can explain that it is an extremely potent psychedelic mushroom. Marcus starts to trip balls almost instantly, so Ron eats one mushroom to help him. The two space out until Marcus is pounced on by what he believes is a fox attacking him. He nearly grabs a knife to kill it until Ron stops him to point out Harold and his group, revealing that the ""fox"" was actually Harold's dog playfully pouncing on Marcus. Harold tries to approach Marcus with respectful intents, but Marcus's hallucinations make him see Harold as a clown, and is unable to stop laughing. Ron steps in and saves him by saying that he knows Marcus wants nothing more than to make a good impression on Harold.Ron later joins Marcus as they go golfing against Gabe and his buddy Bennet (Kamal Bolden), while Kyla continues to hang out with Emily and her family. Emily gets nervous because Kyla is giving ""special"" medicine to her Grandma Phyllis (Denise Burse), who is typically quiet and doesn't move around too much because of her condition. While on the golf course, Ron appears super drunk and they keep missing every hole they come across. In the middle of the game, Ron takes out a lot of money, which he reveals he got from pawning off Marcus and Emily's wedding rings. Marcus is livid until Ron wagers with Gabe and Bennet for all the money, plus Bennet's Ferrari. Ron pulls off an impressive swing on the last hole to get a hole in one.The guys go to the pawnshop just before it closes, and Marcus gets the rings back. Ron sees a bird flying overhead, and because he earlier told Marcus that he knows when a bird is going to poop, he pushes Marcus out of the way just before he gets crapped on...and this causes Marcus to drop the rings down the sewer. He begins to freak out on Ron for causing all of this, and Ron starts telling Marcus that he helped Kyla conceive a child after doctors told him that he is sterile, seemingly confirming that Marcus really is the father of Kyla's child.That night, the family hosts a party, where Marcus's construction buddies show up after being invited by Ron. Ron and Kyla then go up on stage to announce to everyone how Marcus has lent a hand in helping them have a baby. Before Kyla can finish her sentence, Marcus tries to own up to it himself and declare to everyone that he is the father of Kyla's baby after they had the drug-fueled sexual encounter. It actually turns out that this is not the case - after the couples did their cliff dive, Ron thinks that the impact the water landing had on his balls caused him to undo his infertility, and so he successfully impregnated Kyla. Emily stands up to admit that it was she who had sex with Kyla, and they were just on top of Marcus, who wasn't involved in it. Harold angrily berates Marcus, who then reveals that he lost the rings. When Gabe tries to berate him too, Marcus punches him in the face again. A brawl then breaks out between Gabe's friends and Marcus's construction buddies, and Marcus leaves dejectedly. On the way out, Ron and Kyla try to talk to Marcus and Emily, but the two of them snap at the other couple and say that they were never friends and deliberately avoided keeping in touch with them because of how crazy they are. Ron and Kyla are hurt and agree to leave.On the morning of Marcus and Emily's wedding, the two believe that there won't be a wedding. Harold then comes in with the construction guys, all of them very drunk. Harold has loosened up and admits to Marcus that he has been hard on him, but he is willing to give him another chance, which Marcus accepts. Emily is then visited by Grandma Phyllis, who is now able to walk thanks to the medicine Kyla gave her. She gives Emily a note and gift from Kyla, which is an apology to her and Marcus for ruining their wedding, but also an admission that the two of them felt like their best friends in forever, especially because Ron's own best friend passed away and he didn't meet another guy like that until Marcus came along. In the box is the wedding rings that Ron spent all day fishing out of the sewers. Marcus and Emily feel really bad and set off to go find Ron and Kyla.Emily remembers that Kyla mentioned she and Ron like to go to Waffle House, so she and Marcus go to multiple Waffle Houses until they eventually find Ron and Kyla. Although the two are still upset with Marcus and Emily, the latter two apologize, and Marcus kisses Ron's forehead, which he had earlier said is the ultimate sign of respect. They forgive Marcus and Emily, and they still want to name their baby after Marcus. They agree to go to the wedding on the condition that Marcus and Emily go to theirs.Months later, Marcus and Emily return to the cave in Mexico along with both their families (and Baby Marcus) to watch Ron and Kyla get married. The couples then all jump off the cliff into the ocean again."

Having foreseen their impending danger, the elderly Romani leader cast a set of silver dentures in the form of a wolf's fangs for their protection. After the slaughter, the clan leader and a male Romani are captured, the latter being dismembered and erected as a scarecrow to serve as a warning to other Romani, whilst the Romani leader is buried alive with the silver fangs clutched in her grasp.Soon after, the townspeople, including Seamus' children Edward and Charlotte, are plagued by nightmares of the scarecrow and the silver fangs.

Cutting open the creature reveals Anne-Marie, screaming in a murderous rage. John insists that she cannot be saved and orders a villager to shoot and kill her. John explains that the infection causes a victim to become one of the creatures, with Seamus realising that Edward has suffered the same fate. John reveals to Seamus' wife Isabelle that his wife and daughter were killed by a similar beast - he was investigating the Romani as they pronounced the ""curse"" on the land had been fulfilled. Isabelle also reveals that Seamus was the orchestrator of the Romani massacre and so is the target of the curse, along with his kin.Charlotte informs John of the silver fangs' location, which he melts down into four silver bullets. The first beast attacks and bites Seamus' maid Anais, but withdraws as Seamus returns from a failed hunting party. Anais bandages and hides her wounds. John notices evidence of Anais' attack but falls into an argument with Seamus about his actions before he can pursue the maid. Seamus investigates a noise coming from Anais' room and is ambushed by a transformed Anais, knocking his candlestick over and setting the manor ablaze. Seamus successfully kills the Anais creature but not before he is bitten. Knowing that he is doomed to transform and attack his family, Seamus immolates himself in front of John. Retrieving Charlotte and Isabelle, John leads them to the church where the other townspeople have taken shelter from the attacks.During the night after everyone has fallen asleep, Isabelle goes to pray and hears Edward's voice calling to her from outside the barricaded church doors. A grief-stricken Isabelle lifts the barricade, letting the rampaging beast into the church where it proceeds to massacre the townspeople. John attempts to shoot the beast with a silver bullet, but Isabelle intentionally stands between his aim and the beast, calling out to the transformed Edward. As the raging beast mauls her, John has no other choice but to shoot through Isabelle into the beast. Both fall to the floor, and as Isabelle dies, Edward reverts to his human form. Isabelle dies embracing her weeping, reanimated human son.With both their parents dead and their manor destroyed, John takes care of Edward and Charlotte, who returns to John the three remaining silver bullets from the attack in the church. It is revealed that the mortally wounded French captain is the adult Edward, having had the silver bullet lodged inside him ever since he was shot as a creature/child in the church. With the silver bullet removed, Edward dies on the operating table. Some time later, an adult Charlotte visits an elderly bed-ridden John, returning the fourth silver bullet. (thanks to Wikipedia)"

The Woman in the Window,2021,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6111574/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"An agoraphobic woman living alone in New York begins spying on her new neighbors, only to witness a disturbing act of violence. Living in denial, the depressed, pill-popping child psychologist, Anna Fox, has holed herself up in her eerily vacant, ill-lit Manhattan brownstone apartment for the past ten long months, separated from her husband and their eight-year-old daughter. While unsuccessfully grappling with agoraphobia and intense panic attacks, suddenly, the Russells move in across the street, and brimming with curiosity, Anna decides to distract attention away from her problems by peeking into the lives of the unsuspecting new tenants. Then, one night, tensions flare, a deadly kitchen knife gleams in the dim light, and before long, someone ends up dead. Has troubled Anna, indeed, witnessed a gruesome scene of blood-stained domestic violence or is her wine-addled mind playing cruel tricks on her?—Nick Riganas Child psychologist Anna Fox (Amy Adams) lives alone in a Manhattan brownstone apartment after becoming separated from her husband Edward; he lives away with their daughter Olivia, but she talks to them on a daily basis. Anna suffers from agoraphobia, and her housebound state leads her to observe all of her neighbors from a second-story window, including the Russell family who have recently moved in across the street. Anna takes a large number of medication and drinks alcohol daily.One evening, Jane Russell (Julianne Moore) visits Anna and they befriend one another over wine and a game of cards. Ethan (Fred Hechinger), Jane's teenage son, also comes over to introduce himself to Anna, who suggests his father Alistair (Gary Oldman) is often abusive towards his family. One night, Anna witnesses Jane being stabbed to death in the living room. She contacts the police but they do not believe her, claiming everyone in the family is fine. Alistair arrives along with ""Jane"" (Jennifer Jason Leigh) who, to the shock of Anna, is a different woman to the one she met. She begins spying on the Russell family.Anna's tenant David (Wyatt Russell) lives downstairs in her basement, and claims he did not hear or see anything from the night the original Jane was supposedly murdered, though Anna later finds her earring in his bedroom and learns David was once in prison and has broken his bail conditions.

It is revealed that Edward and Olivia are dead as a result of a car accident that Anna accidentally caused; she is now agoraphobic as a result and her medication causes her to have hallucinations and conversations with people who are not really there.Anna apologizes to the Russell family and admits she was wrong. She stops pursuing her suspicions and later records a video on her cell phone, planning to end her life by suicide by taking an overdose. Anna then discovers a photograph she took on her phone of her cat and, in the reflection of a wine glass, is the original Jane, proving she is real. Anna shows David the photo and he confesses the original Jane she met is a woman named Katie Meli, Ethan's birth mother. Katie had been stalking the Russell family, trying to get close to Ethan, hence why they had to move to Manhattan. David refuses to corroborate Katie's existence to prove Anna's story when he is suddenly attacked by Ethan, who had been lurking in the apartment.Ethan reveals to Anna that he murdered Katie and is a budding serial killer, having also killed Alistair's secretary in Boston, and says he intends to kill Anna as well.

The Card Counter,2021,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11196036/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Redemption is the long game in Paul Schrader's THE CARD COUNTER. Told with Schrader's trademark cinematic intensity, the revenge thriller tells the story of an ex-military interrogator turned gambler haunted by the ghosts of his past. William Tell is a gambler who taught himself how to count cards during an eight-year stint in military prison. Seeking to avoid attention - either fame or casino bouncers - Tell's gambling philosophy is to bet small and win modestly. Despite gambling nearly every day, he never stays in a casino hotel. He lives out of two small suitcases and stays in motels, where he removes any decor and covers all the furniture in plain sheets secured with twine.
At a casino, Tell encounters La Linda, an acquaintance from the gambling world. She runs a stable, a group of investors who back gamblers for a portion of their winnings. She offers to stake William but he refuses, unwilling to be burdened by the responsibility.
In Atlantic City, a security-industry convention is being held in the same building as the casino. Tell slips into a seminar held by retired Major John Gordo, but decides to leave almost immediately. On the way out, he is recognized and confronted by a young man, Cirk Baufort, who slips him his name and number. After a nightmare about torture in a prison camp, Tell calls the young man and agrees to meet. Cirk informs Tell he knows who he really is: PFC William Tillich, a soldier who was tried and convicted for his role in the Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse. Cirk explains that his father, Roger Baufort, was also at Abu Ghraib; like Tell, he was dishonorably discharged and served time, but the experience led him to drug addiction and made him violently abusive. Cirk's mother left the family, and Roger eventually killed himself. Gordo was the superior of Tillich and the elder Baufort and trained them in enhanced interrogation techniques, but as he was involved as a ""civilian consultant"" avoided facing any charges or culpability. Cirk holds Gordo responsible for what happened to his family and is planning to capture, torture, and kill him for revenge and seeks Tell's help. Tell refuses but offers to take Cirk along as he gambles in an attempt to help the young man avoid a violent life.
At their next stop, Tell informs La Linda that he is interested in making an arrangement. He reveals to her his desire to go on the World Series of Poker tour in order to win enough money to help Cirk cover his debts and start a new life, after which Tell will retire. After early WSOP matches, Tell makes money but loses to Mr. USA, an obnoxious Ukrainian player who has taken on a jingoistic American persona. He bonds with Cirk and feels a growing attraction to La Linda, but avoids getting too close as he continues making money gambling.
At a qualifying round in Panama City, Cirk shares that he still plans to kill Gordo. Tell takes Cirk back to his motel, confronting the younger man with a harsh interrogator persona. He presents Cirk with $150,000 from his gambling winnings, enough for Cirk to pay off his and his mother's debts and return to college. He insists Cirk return to his mother in Oregon and forget about Gordo, threatening violence if he does not comply; Cirk leaves with the money. Tell, who has begun a relationship with La Linda, advances to the final table of the WSOP. While on a break he receives a message from Cirk, revealing that rather than returning home he went to Gordo's house to kill him. Tell is unsettled and, distracted during the resumed match, abruptly walks off the casino floor. A news report shows that Gordo had killed an armed home intruder - Cirk.
Tell drives through the night to get to Gordo's house, covering the furniture as he does in his motel rooms. Gordo returns home and Tell holds him at gunpoint, revealing who he is and why he is there. Rather than shooting him, Tell takes Gordo into another room for a ""dramatic reenactment"" of their time in Abu Gharib. Both men are heard screaming in agony, and eventually Tell emerges from the room severely wounded. He calls the police to report a homicide.
Tell is incarcerated in the same military prison as before, accepting the routine and ascetic setting as he feels it is what he deserves. La Linda arrives for a visit and the two reach out to each other, each placing a single finger on the glass separating them."
Snake Eyes,2021,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8404256/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A G.I. Joe spin-off centered around the character of Snake Eyes. After saving the life of their heir apparent, tenacious loner Snake Eyes is welcomed into an ancient Japanese clan called the Arashikage where he is taught the ways of the ninja warrior. But, when secrets from his past are revealed, Snake Eyes' honor and allegiance will be tested - even if that means losing the trust of those closest to him. A young boy is orphaned when his father is murdered. Years later, the boy has grown into a talented and deadly martial arts fighter, driven by a desire to avenge his father. To conceal his true identity, he calls himself ""Snake Eyes"", a name inspired by watching his father's murderer force him to roll a pair of dice to determine his fate; his father was killed when he rolled double ones.While working at a fish factory, Snake Eyes is approached by a wealthy yakuza boss, Kenta, who offers to find his father's killer if Snake Eyes works for him. When Snake Eyes is asked to prove his loyalty by shooting a man who betrayed Kenta's trust, Snake Eyes deliberately misses the shot and helps the traitor escape. The traitor is revealed to be Kenta's cousin, Tommy. Tommy and Kenta were both in line to lead Clan Arashikage, an ancient society devoted to preserving order and fighting evil. Kenta sought to kill his brother, but failed, and was banished.Grateful to Snake Eyes for helping him escape, Tommy takes Snake Eyes to his clan and asks that he be initiated as a member. The current clan leader, Tommy's grandmother Sen, agrees to let Snake Eyes undergo three trials to determine whether he is worthy of membership. The clan's head of security, Akiko, doesn't trust Snake Eyes, but he wins her trust by revealing his sincerity to join the clan and finally avenge himself on his father's killer. The two gradually start to form a romantic attachment. Unbeknownst to anyone, Snake Eyes plans to betray his new allies. Tommy's attempted murder and escape is shown to have been staged by Kenta in order to get Snake Eyes close enough to steal the clan's most sacred treasure, the ""Jewel of the Sun"".Snake Eyes finds himself increasingly torn between his guilt over betraying Tommy and his clan, and his overwhelming desire for revenge. He passes the first two trials with his exceptional talents, and learns that the third and final trial requires his spirit to be tested by sacred anacondas, who know whether or not he is truly pure of heart.

Confronted by the clan, Snake Eyes admits that he has been not been honest, but manages to hide the true reason he betrayed the clan. As a consequence, he is expelled.Snake Eyes returns in secret and steals the jewel using his knowledge of the clan's temple, delivering it to Kenta. Kenta explains that he is stealing the jewel on behalf of a terrorist organization known as Cobra. Cobra, through their liaison, the Baroness, has been arming Kenta with weapons so that he can seize control of Clan Arashikage. Snake Eyes receives his reward for stealing the jewel: his father's killer, who turns out to be a Cobra agent. Having realized what his bloodlust has cost him, Snake Eyes spares the man and instead goes back to Clan Arashikage to warn them of Kenta's attack.Tommy puts aside his anger and lets Snake Eyes assist him and the clan's warriors, including a red-haired woman with a crossbow, in fighting off Kenta's men. After Kenta admits that he has no intention of handing over the jewel, the Baroness abandons him and defects to the clan's side. With his men defeated, Kenta loses the jewel to Tommy, who in his fury tries to use its power to murder his brother. Kenta manages to escape, but Snake Eyes traps him in the anaconda pit, where the snakes devour Kenta upon sensing his evil spirit. They judge Snake Eyes to be pure of heart for forgoing his revenge and thus he becomes worthy to join the clan.After the fight, Sen tells Tommy that he is no longer fit to lead the clan as he broke their vow to never use the jewel. Enraged at being denied his birthright, Tommy forsakes the clan and his own family. Snake Eyes meets with the red-haired woman, Scarlett, who explains that his father was a G.I. Joe agent, part of an international peacekeeping organization of which she is also a member. Having completed her service to Clan Arashikage, she offers to bring Snake Eyes with her so he can see whether he would be interested in becoming a Joe. The Baroness locates Tommy, who now calls himself Storm Shadow, and recruits him into Cobra."

The Unholy,2021,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9419056/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A hearing-impaired girl is visited by the Virgin Mary and can suddenly hear, speak, and heal the sick. As people flock to witness her miracles, terrifying events unfold. Are they the work of the Virgin Mary or something much more sinister? After a supposed visitation from the Virgin Mary, young hearing-impaired girl Alice is inexplicably able to hear and speak--and heal the sick. As word spreads and people from near and far flock to witness her miracles, a disgraced journalist hoping to revive his career visits her small New England town to investigate. When terrifying events begin to happen all around, he starts to question if these phenomena are the works of the Virgin Mary or something much more sinister.—anonymous Willing to sell his soul for a story, Gerry Fenn, a defrocked journalist who has fallen from grace, arrives in the sleepy town of Banfield, Massachusetts to investigate a bogus story, only to stumble upon his big break. As young Alice, a local deaf-mute woman, can suddenly hear and speak--and perform miracles--after seeing an otherworldly apparition in the trunk of a dead tree, the news spreads like wildfire, and crowds of people start gathering to witness the modern wonder. Now, the undying spirit speaks through Alice, and the masses vow everlasting devotion. However, is the Lady of Banfield a benevolent, life-giving entity, or does it draw its power from a diabolical source?—Nick Riganas It is implied from sound that a woman is being beaten and executed, whom is later identified as Mary Elnor, accused of witchcraft in 1845 in Banfield, Massachusetts. The woman is hanged from a tree and ultimately set on fire. Before she dies, however, her spirit is bound to the body of a doll.Many years later, disgraced journalist Gerry Fenn works a job reporting on all things strange and unusual. His latest assignment takes him to Boston, where the purported strange activity is revealed to be a teenage prank. As he's preparing to leave, he discovers the doll and purposely crushes it, accidentally freeing Mary's spirit. Gerry later gets into an accident as he's driving away after seeing a young girl, Alice Pagett, run across the road. He follows her to the tree from the prologue, the site where he found the doll, and hears her speak before collapsing. When he takes her to a nearby church, he learns that Alice is deaf and couldn't have spoken. Gerry decides to stay in town to investigate what he thinks could be a real story rather than a hoax or prank.The following day Alice stuns the community by speaking, proclaiming that she has been cured by the Virgin Mary. This launches a media furor that is further propelled by other seemingly miraculous healings. During the healings, a statue of the Virgin Mary near the chancel of the church cries tears of blood. The Catholic Church sends Monsignor Delgarde to investigate the claims, assisted by Bishop Gyles. Gerry befriends Alice, learning that while she has been speaking to an entity named Mary, the girl has only assumed that Mary was the Virgin Mary. Beginning to suspect that something sinister is occurring due to visions of ""Mary"" as a horrific entity, Gerry finds a partner in Father William Hagan, Alice's maternal uncle, who was healed by Alice, but also suspects the healings' true nature. Fr. Hagan discovers a book detailing Mary Elnor, a witch who performed miracles for Satan, but before he has the chance to warn anybody he is attacked by Mary and his body is found hanging in the church. Bishop Gyles convinces Gerry to keep the apparent suicide of Hagan quiet as it will tarnish the divine occurrences. His death is declared an accident.Gerry befriends Natalie Gates, the town's physician, and reveals that he was found fabricating stories which is why he now reports hoax stories, hoping this event will relaunch his career. The pair eventually comes across the information Fr. Hagan discovered, revealing Mary sold her soul to Satan in order to gain power. Satan would allow her and her descendants (one of whom is revealed to be Alice) to perform ""miracles"" prompting people to pledge themselves to her, and in turn, Satan. Mary tries to kill Gerry, but Msgr. Delgarde drives her away with prayer and his crucifix. Gerry and Delgarde are shocked to learn that Bishop Gyles was aware of the history in Banfield involving Elnor, but thought that it was not connected to the miracles that were recently occurring. He warns Gerry that any attempt to share his views on the situation will fall on deaf ears due to Gerry's tarnished reputation.Alice, who they believe is unaware of Mary's true nature, wishes to hold a church service by the tree and broadcast it to the masses. Msgr. Delgarde warns that those pledging themselves to Mary Elnor would make her stronger and condemn their soul to Hell. Msgr. Delgarde, along with Gerry and Natalie, tries to perform a ritual in the church to stop this, but Mary appears and crushes him with a burning cross.Once the service begins, Alice urges everyone to pledge themselves to Mary Elnor three times. Gerry manages to stop the crowd from fully pledging by claiming that the miracles were just more of his hoaxes, that they were all a result of the placebo effect. Natalie communicates with Alice using sign language, urging her to stop the service. Mary speaks to Alice, entreating her to continue it or never speak again. Realizing Mary's true nature, Alice confirms that the miracles were not of God. The tree suddenly bursts into flames, causing all the attendants to flee in panic as an angry Mary emerges from it. She incinerates Bishop Gyles before trying to kill Gerry, but Alice sacrifices herself to save his life. This in turn causes Mary to disappear, as Alice was her link to the living world. Struck by her sacrifice, Gerry begs God to save Alice's life. She comes back to life, but is once again deaf. All the people whom Alice cured soon return to their prior state and the film concludes with a warning from Biblical verse Matthew 7:15.

Munich: The Edge of War,2021,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7475578/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A British diplomat travels to Munich in the run-up to World War II, where a former classmate of his from Oxford is also en route, but is working for the German government. Based on the international bestseller by Robert Harris. It is Autumn 1938 and Europe stands on the brink of war. Adolf Hitler is preparing to invade Czechoslovakia and Neville Chamberlain's government desperately seeks a peaceful solution. With the pressure building, Hugh Legat, British civil servant, and Paul von Hartmann, German diplomat, travel to Munich for the emergency Conference. As negotiations begin, the two old friends find themselves at the center of a web of political subterfuge and very real danger.—Netflix In 1932, friends Hugh Legat (George MacKay), Paul Von Hartmann (Jannis Niewöhner) and his girlfriend Lena (Liv Lisa Fries) celebrate their graduation from Oxford University. Hartmann insists they visit him in Munich to experience the ""New Germany"".Six years later, Legat works as British prime minister Neville Chamberlain's (Jeremy Irons) secretary as Europe is on the brink of war. He is married to Pamela Legat (Jessica Brown Findlay). Chamberlain strives to obtain peace with Adolf Hitler (Ulrich Matthes) at any cost, even if that means allowing Germany to seize control of the Sudetenland from Britain's ally Czechoslovakia. But Chamberlain's talks with Hitler break down and Hilter plans to invade Sudetenland the very next day. Hugh works for his boss Sir Osmund Cleverly (Mark Lewis Jones), under the office of the PMO.
Chamberlain remembers from a speech given by Hitler that he considers Mussolini as his friend. Chamberlain believes it is his duty to do absolutely everything in his power to avoid war.
Chamberlain writes to Benito Mussolini in an effort to halt military action; it seemingly works (at the very last minute Chamberlain receives word (while he was addressing the house) that Mussolini has intervened) and Hitler agrees, inviting Chamberlain and French prime minister Édouard Daladier to Munich for a conference.Hartmann meanwhile works as a translator in the Foreign Office in Berlin while secretly plotting with a Wehrmacht general in an effort to overthrow Hitler if top army officials agree to arrest him and seize control. The general believes this cannot be accomplished unless Hitler is allowed to invade the Sudetenland, while Hartmann doubts the collective resolve of the generals.
Now with the conference, Hartmann is sure that Chamberlain will sacrifice Sudentenland to prevent war. Hitler would not need to invade and thus he would not be arrested.
Hartmann is given a stolen document by his lover, Helen Winter (Sandra Hüller), that indicates Hitler intends to conquer Europe. Hartmann and the others reconvene and agree that getting the information to Chamberlain while he is in Munich is their best option (so Chamberlain doesn't make the deal and Hitler is forced to invade); Hartmann reveals he has a trusted former classmate, Legat, who can likely help. Legat is approached by Sir Horace Wilson (Alex Jennings) and a top MI6 official regarding the document in Hartmann's possession and agrees to help obtain it despite the dangers associated with espionage.Legat remembers how Hartmann was rabidly pro-Hitler when he visited him in Munich few yrs ago.
Legat convinces Chamberlain to bring him with to Munich under the guise of being a translator. Hartmann boards Hitler's train to Munich and hides the document and a pistol in the bathroom, soon discovering his roommate is a childhood friend named Franz Sauer (August Diehl), who has become a Schutzstaffel officer. Sauer becomes suspicious of Hartmann, who catches him rummaging through his suitcase in the train. Hartmann meets with Hitler, who chastises him for his Oxford education.In Munich, Legat and Hartmann reunite, a flashback reveals they had a falling out in 1932 after a heated verbal argument related to Hartmann's then-support of Nazism. Legat agrees to take possession of the document, but insists Hartmann himself present the argument to Chamberlain that he should not sign the Munich Agreement. Legat and Hartmann meet with Chamberlain, who scoffs at the idea of not signing the agreement based on vague German military plans for a coup and refuses to take action. Chamberlain signs the agreement with Hitler shortly thereafter. Legat promises Hartmann to take the document to London and continue to press the issue.
Later that night, Hartmann takes Legat to a local nursing home to see Lena, revealing that in 1935 she attended an anti-Nazi rally, only to have a Star of David carved in her back and thrown from a window after she was found to be Jewish, resulting in paralysis and an inability to speak.
Hartmann reveals he intends to assassinate Hitler much to Legat's dismay. When Legat returns to his hotel, he finds his room has been ransacked by Franz (who had seen Legat meet Hartmann at a local pub and had started tailing him) who attacks him. Legat discovers the document is gone and panics, but he is able to get a discreet message to Hartmann informing him.
Meanwhile Chamberlain asks Hitler to sign a document of peace between Britain and Germany, which Hitler does. Chamberlain considers this as a great victory.
Hartmann meets with Hitler to deliver the morning news reports but cannot bring himself to shoot him.As Legat enters the car bound for the airport, typist Joan Menzies (Anjli Mohindra) reveals she is the niece of a British army colonel (assigned to keep a watch out Legat), and that she took possession of the document to prevent Sauer from finding it. Chamberlain returns to Britain a hero and gives his famous Peace for our time speech. Legat returns home to his wife and son, revealing that with the war coming, he plans to quit his job and join the RAF. The Munich Agreement ultimately fails and World War II begins just one year later. Chamberlain resigns in disgrace before dying soon after. The document, however, prompts the British to prepare for and ultimately win the war."

His former employers try unsuccessfully to persuade Brown to work on a Roman villa they deem more important. They ignore Brown, who left school aged only 12, when he suggests the mounds could be Anglo-Saxon rather than the more common Viking era.Working with a few assistants from the estate, Brown slowly excavates the more promising of the mounds. One day the trench collapses on him, but he is dug out in time and revived. Meanwhile, he spends more time with Edith, a widow, and her young son, Robert, and ignores daily letters from his wife, May. Edith struggles with health issues and is warned by her doctor to avoid stress.Brown is astonished to uncover iron rivets from a ship, which could only make it the burial site of someone of tremendous distinction, such as a king. Prominent local archaeologist James Reid Moir attempts to join the dig but is rebuffed; Edith instead hires her cousin Rory Lomax to join the project. News of the discovery soon spreads, and Cambridge archaeologist Charles Phillips arrives, declares the site to be of national importance, and takes over the dig by order of the Office of Works.As war approaches, Philips brings in a large team, including Peggy Piggott, who uncovers the first distinctively Anglo-Saxon artifact. Brown is retained only to keep the site in order, but Edith intervenes and he resumes digging. Brown discovers a Merovingian Tremissis, a small gold coin of Late Antiquity, and Philips declares the site to be of major historical significance. Philips wants to send all the items to the British Museum, but Edith, concerned about the war raids in London, asserts her rights. An inquest confirms she is the owner of the ship and its priceless treasure trove of grave goods, but she despairs as her health continues to decline.Peggy - who is neglected by her husband, Stuart, who is a closeted homosexual - begins a romance with Rory, but he is soon called up by the Royal Air Force. Edith decides to donate the Sutton Hoo treasure to the British Museum, requesting that Brown be given recognition for his work. She dies in 1942.A note states that the treasure was hidden in the London Underground during the war and was first exhibited - without any mention of Basil Brown - nine years after Edith's death. Only recently was Brown given full credit for his contribution and his name is now displayed permanently alongside Pretty's at the British Museum."

Jolt,2021,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10228134/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A bouncer with a slightly murderous anger-management problem that she controls with the help of an electrode-lined vest she uses to shock herself back to normalcy whenever she gets homicidal. A bouncer with a slightly murderous anger-management problem that she controls with the help of an electrode-lined vest she uses to shock herself back to normalcy whenever she gets homicidal. After the first guy she's ever fallen for is murdered, she goes on a revenge-fueled rampage to find the killer while the cops pursue her as their chief suspect. Lindy Lewis (Kate Beckinsale) is a young woman afflicted with intermittent explosive disorder. This causes her to react with violent rage at even the slightest transgression because her body has an unusually high level of Cortisol, which in turn makes her stronger and faster than normal. Her parents eventually have her institutionalized due to her violent tendencies. After they fail to control her, the organization puts Lindy in the army, but they are also unsuccessful at controlling her rage. Finally, Lindy is subjected to an experimental (but effective) treatment to control her rage; a form of self-administered shock treatment given through an electrode-lined vest she must wear at all times, allowing her to live a normal life.Some time later, Lindy is prompted to go on a date by her therapist (and the vest designer), Dr. Ivan Munchin (Stanley Tucci). Munchin believes that, believing this will test if she is able to have a healthy, normal relationship with someone. Eventually, Lindy decides to go on a date with an accountant named Justin (Jai Courtney). While on the date, Lindy beats their waitress (who was giving a hard time to Justin, just because he had allergies to nuts (and almost everything on the menu had nuts)) and leaves, returning to Dr. Munchin to have her electroshock remote fixed. Munchin reveals that there is nothing wrong with the remote; she has merely built up a tolerance to the electricity and ups the dosage. Dr Munchin tells Lindy that she likes the guy and encourages her to go on a date again, and have a real relationship.Lindy contacts Justin to go on a second date. They discuss their past (Lindy was a bouncer) as well as Justin's job. Justin reveals that he only has one client; a man named Barry. They go back to Lindy's apartment and start to have sex. Justin sees Lindy's voltage therapy vest and electrodes all over her body, but he tells her it is not a big deal, and begins taking her vest off.The next morning, Justin gets Lindy a gift along with breakfast in bed. Lindy opens the gift to see a camera, bought by Justin due to her mentioning that she likes to take pictures of people. Justin asks her to explain her voltage therapy. After explaining her condition, Justin appears to accept it. Justin then leaves for work and invites Lindy over for dinner later. Lindy visits Dr. Munchin to tell him that his theory worked and that she likes Justin a lot. Munchin insists that they have a session to deal with these feelings, but Lindy leaves to take pictures with the camera Justin gave her.
Later on, Lindy calls Justin's phone after not hearing from him all day and a Detective Vicars (Bobby Cannavale) answers. She goes to the police station to sit with Detective Vicars and Detective Nevins (Laverne Cox) and they state that Justin was murdered.Lindy replays her time with Justin and begins to spiral, shocking herself repeatedly with the vest. She visits Munchin, claiming that the vest is not working, so he gives her a sedative. Once she comes to she says she needs to find out who murdered Justin. He tells her to let it go before it changes her irreversibly. Lindy then calls the detectives claiming to have more details about Justin's murder, as a ploy to get them out of the precinct so as to gain access to the evidence room from Justin's murder.
Lindy then heads to Justin's house and finds his phone. She is called by Detective Vicars who tells her that they found her and that Detective Nevins is on the way to arrest her. After a brief encounter with Nevins (Nevins tries to shoot Lindy, but Lindy distracts her and escapes), Lindy takes Justin's car and after a brief car chase in which Vicars is injured, she escapes.
Lindy goes to an electronics store to talk to someone about hacking Justin's phone and meets Andi, a female hacker (a little girl) working in the store. Andi is able to locate Justin's client, Barry Kasparzki, a notorious gangster who was confirmed to be the last person in contact with him.Upon finding out that Barry is in an abandoned building overseeing an underground fight, Lindy goes to that fight and demands that Barry tell her who killed Justin. He agrees, on the condition that she fight his top three guys all at once. Upon winning however, Barry tries to get her killed. But, Lindy manages to incapacitate both Barry and the gunman and gets him to tells her who killed Justin after threatening him with jumper cables.
Barry tells her that a billionaire recluse named Gareth Fizel (David Bradley) (And Barry's boss) had Justin killed; she electrocutes him with the jumper cables anyway. Lindy visits Detective Vicars, now in the hospital after their car chase earlier, and asks him about Fizel (Vicars tells her Fizel's location as he is convinced that Lindy cared for Justin). However, Detective Nevins interrupts them and chases Lindy to the maternity ward, where Lindy begins throwing infants at Nevins to slow her down.Lindy makes her way to Gareth's building where his head of security, Delacroix (Ori Pfeffer), knocks her unconscious. She awakens in a white room, zip-tied to a chair. Delacroix has also removed her vest. After threatening to kill her, Delacroix puts Lindy in a car back to her apartment and keeps the electroshock vest. Back at Fizel's building, Fizel tells Delacroix to get rid of Lindy (after he hears that Lindy was asking for Justin and suspects that Fizel killed him). Back in the car, Lindy tells the driver to let her out of the car, but he does not comply, so she grabs him and begins to choke him causing him to crash.
Lindy then goes to Dr. Munchin to get a new vest and returns to her apartment. She notices the 9 sign on her door has been moved, showing that someone was there, so she sneaks in her window and notices that Fizel's men have rigged an explosive device to the doorway. She then disarms the explosive and pockets it for future use. She leaves, sees Detective Vicars outside her apartment, and gets in his car. She tells him he cannot arrest her because of her condition and he would be safer not to. He explains he will go easy on her because she is different and that it has nothing to do with what Nevins says about her being a woman. Her apartment blows up and she leaves.She finds Fizel (she is captured by Delacroix when she tries to climb into Fizel's building); he tells her he is sorry that he killed Justin. He says he is glad he was able to see her before Delacroix hits her in the head again and she is back in the drainage room. He asks her if she knows what Exsanguinate means (Drainage of one's blood) and then explains it while doing it to her. She breaks free and fights him. She turns to ask how to get to Fizel before hurting Delacroix. She then fights off a few guards. After using Delacroix's finger to access Fizel's lair, Lindy learns that Justin isn't dead but in fact Justin used her as a decoy so he himself could kill Fizel (Justin works for the CIA and could not touch Fizel officially and hence used Lindy to get close to him).
Justin tells her Dr. Mucnhin had something to do with everything (CIA funds his experiments) and that she was only an experiment. She goes after him and he detonates her voltage electrodes (he has the remote and he has increased the voltages). The vest becomes ineffective because she is highly upset. Lindy throws him a bag that has the bomb in it, blowing up Fizel's entire lair as she rides the elevator down.Lindy waits for Dr. Munchin in his office ready to kill him for betraying her. Just as she decides against it and handcuffs him, Detectives Vicars and Nevins enter the office to arrest Dr. Munchin on various charges. Lindy returns to her apartment and a woman (Susan Sarandon), one of the doctors from Lindy's past, tells her that by embracing her rage she will truly become powerful. The woman then presses the voltage detonator."

Set in the near future, the film chronicles the odyssey of 30 young men and women who are sent deep into space on a multi-generational mission in search of a new home. The mission descends into madness, as the crew reverts to its most primal state, not knowing if the real threat they face is what's outside the ship or who they're becoming inside it.—Lionsgate With the future of the human race at stake, a group of young men and women bred for intelligence and obedience embark on an expedition to colonize a distant planet. When they uncover disturbing secrets about the mission, they defy their training and begin to explore their most primitive natures. As life on the ship descends into chaos, they soon become consumed by fear, lust and an insatiable hunger for power.—yusufpiskin n 2063, astrophysicists on a climate-change-ravaged Earth find a habitable planet. A scouting mission is sent, although the 86-year flight means that the grandchildren of the launch crew astronauts will be the ones who reach the planet. To help the launch crew cope with the knowledge that their remaining lives will likely be spent mostly in flight, the original 30 are bred through IVF and kept in isolation from the rest of the world. In order to extend their time in flight, they are launched on the Humanitas spaceship as pre-teens, with a single adult, senior program commander Richard, to guide them through the early part of the journey. To conserve resources, the plan is for IVF to be performed when the crew turns 24, to be repeated on those offspring when they turn 24.During the tenth year of the flight, Christopher and Zac discover that the grown teenagers are being given a blue chemical in their food to suppress sex drive and pleasure response, keeping them all docile and manageable. The pair stops taking the chemical, and their surging hormones drive them to become competitive, careless, and anxious to engage in sexual relations, specifically with their crew mate Sela, who has been trained to be the chief medical officer.During a repair effort outside the Humanitas to address a failed Earth communication system, Richard, who has been serving as chief officer, is killed, apparently by an unseen entity, and a fire damages more ship systems. Christopher is voted the new chief officer, which upsets Zac, who then tells the others to stop ingesting the chemical. The mission descends into madness, as many of the young men and women revert to their most primal state.Zac tells the others that an alien killed Richard, that he will protect them and let them eat all the (closely conserved) food they want, and convinces all but five to follow him rather than Christopher. Christopher and Sela, who have become a couple, find and repair a video disk that reveals that Zac killed Richard, precipitating the further systems damage, by turning on the electricity to the communications array while Richard was working on it. They show the others, but Zac still convinces many that an alien is inhabiting one of them, leading many to follow Zac in vigilante murders of anyone he targets.Christopher inadvertently leads Zac to a hidden compartment on the ship, which proves to be weapons for their grandchildren to use on the planet. Christopher, Sela, and Phoebe are the only holdouts. Phoebe is killed, and the pack searches for Christopher and Sela. The pair tricks Zac into being ejected into space, and peace returns to Humanitas. Sela is then voted chief officer. The crew decides to permanently forgo the blue chemical and learn to manage their natural emotions, as well as falling in love and having children naturally, instead of via IVF as had been originally planned.Decades later, Humanitas and its multi-generational crew arrive at the planet, which appears from orbit to be as earth-like as had been hoped.

Once LAPD's top detective, Charlie Waldo has dropped out of society. He lives in a tiny hilltop cabin above the city and obsessively possesses only 100 things. He also minimizes his carbon footprint. He rides a bicycle and in three years has grown a large, scruffy beard. Into this new world comes his former lover, private investigator Lorena, to ask for his help investigating a high-profile murder: TV actor Alastair Pinch stands accused of murdering his wife Monica, but he was drunk and remembers nothing.—Kirkus reviews 11 years ago, LAPD detective Charlie Waldo (Charlie Hunnam) arrested a kid, Lydell Lipps, in a homicide. Two years later, he discovered that Lydell Lipps was innocent and that his partner, 7-Eleven, had framed him in a personal vendetta. Charlie, who arrested Lydell Lipps, tried to prove his innocence. But he soon realized that the system was designed to put a guilty man in and not take an innocent man out of prison. In frustration, Charlie left the LAPD and gave interviews to almost anyone who was willing to hear them. His actions flamed his relationship with the system, but Charlie didn't care. He left Hollywood land and settled in the woods with 100 possessions to his name.Last Looks begins as Charlie's ex-girlfriend, Lorena Nascimento (Morena Baccarin), pays him a visit and offers him a job. A Hollywood studio, Black Bear, wants to hire Charlie as a private investigator to investigate the murder of Monica, the wife of Alastair Pinch. Alastair, who is suspected of murdering his wife, stars in Black Bear's most grossing television drama, Johnnie's Bench. The studio cannot afford to lose their star actor and thus is paying for a high-profile lawyer along with a famous private detective like Charlie, who is passionate about finding the truth.However, Charlie refuses to take the job because he desires neither fame nor name. Lorena leaves Charlie's trailer, requesting him to consider the offer.A few days later, a cop arrives at Charlie's place and informs him that Lorena has gone missing. She has stolen something of interest from her boss, Don Queue, a cartel lord. Don Q suspects that Lorena dropped his ""mem"" with Charlie and thus tries to threaten him. At night, a group of punks attack Charlie in his trailer and warn him to stay out of Pinch's case. When Charlie informs them that he hasn't accepted the job yet, the punks show him the newspaper report that claims that Charlie Waldo is investigating the murder of Monica Pinch.When Charlie fails to contact Lorena, he decides to meet with the head of the Black Bear Studio, Wilson Sikorsky (Rupert Friend), in LA. But before Charlie can refuse the job, Wilson convinces him to take the case, and Charlie becomes a private eye for Alastair Pinch.While everyone suspected Alastair for the murder of his wife, Charlie intuitively believed that there was more to the mystery than what meets the eye. Charlie started his investigation from the crime scene i.e. Alastair's house where Monica was murdered.Alastair told Charlie that dreadful Saturday, he woke up wasted with no recollection of what happened the previous night. In a state of hangover, he entered the living room and found Monica lying unconscious with an injury on her head. He found shattered piece of vase near her body which the detectives believed was used to murder Monica.The forensic doctor, Freddie, told Charlie Monica died from a cerebral hemorrhage. Charlie was certain that an earth vase could not create such an impact. While in conversation with his ex-accomplices, Charlie figured out that the killer was a strong lefty, not a drunken righty like Alastair. And Monica was probably hit with a Regis Award trophy that Alastair received in England. Unfortunately, the murder weapon was missing, and that complicated the case.While investigating the background of Monica and Alastair, Charlie met a spirited kindergarten teacher, Jayne White (Lucy Fry), who used to teach Pinch's daughter, Gabby. Jayne was extremely thrilled to meet controversial ex-cop Charlie and wanted to know all about his past life. Curiosity soon turned into a passionate romance until Charlie found a secret about Jayne.The moment Charlie stepped into Alastair's house, he suspected that the furniture had been rearranged or moved for some reason. The night table that belonged to the living room was swapped with the one in the bedroom and vice versa. On further investigation, Charlie found a burner phone hidden inside the night table in Alastair's room.Alastair used the cellphone to contact Jayne because he was having an affair with her. But Jayne confessed to Charlie that Alastair wasn't the only kindergarten dad with whom she got involved. Jayne, a young blood who came to Hollywood looking for a rush and a thrill, had no intention of becoming a teacher. When famous dads like Darius Jamshidi and Swag Dogggg showed an interest in her, Jayne used the opportunity.So Charlie finally figured out that all those people thrashing him in his trailer and trying to stop him from investigating Monica's murder case, didn't want Charlie to find out about kindergarten dads and their affair with Jayne White. Hence, when Charlie unraveled Jayne's secret, she disappeared from the scene with Alastair's unborn child.Monica found out that Jayne was pregnant with Alastair's child. Hence, on the night of her murder, she texted Jayne using Alastair's burner phone and called her to the house. Soon, Jayne thought that Alastair wanted to talk about their future, but soon her dreams were shattered. Monica confronted Jayne and blamed the glamorous city of L.A. for ruining her married life. However, according to Jayne, Monica turned violent and so she drove away.Monica wanted to return to England with Alastair and Gabby, which meant that Alastair would leave the show as well. For Black Bear Studios, Johnnie's Bench was the only show that brought in income. If the show had been closed, Wilson Sikorsky would have become financially bankrupt. He would have had to sell his studio to Darius Jamshidi. Wilson was also having an affair with Monica, and thus, to save himself from bankruptcy and scandal, he killed Monica in anger.Sikorsky's show got a lot of free publicity after Monica's death. He decided to reap the benefits and hired controversial Charlie and popular Fontella Davis to handle Alastair's case. No one believed that Charlie would solve the case, but fortunately he did.Charlie was threatened by a lawyer named Warren Gomes, hired by Darius Jamshidi. Warren found out about Wilson Sikorsky's affair with Monica Pinch and started blackmailing him. To shut Warren's mouth, Sikorsky bribed him with his Gadokey skeleton watch. But when Warren asked for more, Sikorsky killed him.At the end of Last Looks, Charlie confronted Sikorsky with the truth. The two men played football while exchanging facts. During the exchange, Charlie revealed that he was 98 percent sure that Sikorsky attacked Monica with the Regis trophy, but he just wanted to make sure that Sikorsky was lefty. The autopsy report confirmed that a strong lefty attacked Monica that night, and this evidence was enough to arrest Sikorsky. However, after entering the cop's car, Sikorsky cunningly gives cops the slip, and gets away driving the cop car.Charlies gives chase on his bike and finally confronts Sikorsky in the sets of Johnnie's Bench, where Sikorsky tried to smash Charlie's head with a production light. But thankfully, Don Q saved Charlie's life and shot Sikorsky.Don Q saved Charlie because he wanted back the memory stick that Lorena stole from him. He revealed that a memory stick contained a poem that Don Q wrote for his daughter, Elsie, to save her from the world of crime. Charlie promised to return the memory drive on the condition that Don Q would allow Lorena to come back to the city. Don Q wanted Charlie to arrange a seat at a private school for Elsie. Well, Charlie had one school in mind, and with Alastair on his side, it was easy for Charlie to get Elsie a proper education.Hence, in the end, Alastair left alcohol and became sober for his daughter, while Lorena returned to Hollywood and was reunited with Charlie. The two romantics chased their ""unfinished business"" and sparked their relationship again. (thanks to dmtalkies)"

Margot, a standard young adult with a dark past. As such, she takes advantage of the Internet to look into her ancestry. Margot turns out to be related to an Amish man named Samuel , who may have some answers or information about why her mother abandoned her as a baby. Together with her friends Chris and Dale , they set out to the middle of nowhere to make a documentary about where she comes from.—subratjain1 Margot and her cameraman friend Chris want to make a documentary about Margot's past. Her mother, Sarah, abandoned her outside a hospital. The security footage of Margot's mother abandoning her disturbs her to this day, as she wonders what drove Sarah to make such a drastic decision. In the present, she meets her blood relative Samuel, who, through a genetics site, discovered that he has a living relative. Soon after, they are joined by Dale, who would be the soundman for the documentary. Samuel leads them to the small Amish community of Beiler Farm, where Margot's mother came from.Jacob, the patriarch of the commune and Sarah's father, welcomes the team, where they find lodging in a rustic room. Late at night, Margot wakes up and discovers red lights moving in the distance. When Margot asks Samuel about the lights the next day, he tells her about a bear that has claimed some of the livestock. Margot visits the barn and finds a little girl brushing her doll's hair. The doll is named Sarah, and when Margot tells the girl that that was her mother's name, the girl cryptically says that Sarah is ""still there."" In the night, strange noises are heard in the attic, and Margot ventures into the old room, which was her mother's. She catches a ghost on camera, and while Dale thinks it's terrifying, Chris is eager to dismiss it as a lens flare.The next morning, they interview Jacob on camera, who tells them about Sarah, who was apparently a free-spirited woman who cared for no one but herself. To defy the practice of marrying someone within the commune, she slept with a boy from the neighboring village and became pregnant. Since pregnancy out of wedlock was against custom, the community intended to force Sarah to give up her baby to a married couple within the group. Sarah instead abandoned her baby at the hospital. Margot is slow to assimilate the story and realizes that her mother had no say in an oppressive society. Sarah is presumed dead, but Margot believes her mother is still alive.While reviewing drone footage, the team finds a church about a mile away from the farm. The church is locked, with the German words ""so weit nicht weiter"" engraved on the door. The phrase cryptically means ""this far, no further."" Before they can enter the church, however, Jacob approaches to tell them that the church is forbidden. That night, Margot and the team discover a strange ritual in the barn in which a newborn two-headed goat is sacrificed.The mystery deepens and Jacob's warning intrigues Margot even more. While Samuel gives Dale a riding lesson, Margot and Chris sneak into the church and discover strange murals drawn on the floor depicting a demonic figure named Asmodeus and scenes of ritual sacrifice. Upon further digging, Chris finds a hidden compartment under the altar, leading to a moat. Seizing the opportunity, Margot asks Chris to lower her into the pit. She hears a strange noise in the darkness before panicking and calling for help. Back in her room, Chris replays the video and discerns that the noise is from an animal.The next day, Margot enters Jacob's room while he is elsewhere and finds a computer in a small adjoining room. She finds correspondence between Jacob and Samuel, and it appears that Jacob knows all about Margot's life. She becomes upset and Chris suggests they leave. That night, a ghoulish shadow attacks Margot in her room. Chris and Dale wake up to find Margot in shock and her sheet soaked with blood. The doctor tells them about Margot's unusual menstrual flow, but they don't believe it.Chris and Dale venture out into the snow to find a ride into town to get a new battery for the vehicle, and the guy giving them a ride also tells them that the people at Beiler Farm are not Amish. Chris and Dale use the store's computer to come to the conclusion that Beiler Farm is a community of demon worshippers. According to myth, the Norwegian village of Beskytter suffered a massacre. It was thought to be the work of Asmodeus, the prince of demons. They trapped the demon inside the body of a woman, who would now pass from mother to daughter in the bloodline.Chris realizes that Sarah has been subjected to a ritual sacrifice to contain the demon god Asmodeus in her body. When Chris and Dale return from their trip from the store, Margot has disappeared. While Dale leaves to install the battery, Chris enters the demonic church to search for Margot. After a bloody encounter with Jacob, Chris finds Margot at the bottom of the pit. He manages to bring Margot back to her senses, but a skeletal creature chases them into the snowy forest as they climb. While in the woods, the creature attacks Dale, while Chris and Margot manage to escape, and seek shelter in the barn, but that doesn't save them. The creature attacks Chris, but Margot calls her name Sarah, and that seems to stop it momentarily. Margot then pushes the creature, which falls onto a spiked row of farm tools, becoming impaled there.While trying to start the truck, Chris realizes that the key is still in Dale's possession. Returning to the woods, they discover Dale dead but recover the keys. When they return to the farm, it has been turned into an inferno. Fulfilling the prophecy of the demon's release, the neighbors are killing each other, much of the livestock is dead and the houses are burning. Then, fortunately, the car starts and they escape from the burning inferno. Later, a police patrol arrives on the scene to see the extent of the damage. A child cries in the barn. When the policeman inquires, he discovers that the child is none other than Samuel. Nodding, the policemen blow their heads off. The demon has possessed Samuel. The last shot shows him driving into the woods, presumably in search of Chris and Margot."

Intrusion,2021,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5563324/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A woman moves to a small town with her husband, but is rattled when she is targeted for a home invasion. After a deadly home invasion at a couple's new dream house, the traumatized wife searches for answers - and learns the real danger is just beginning. As she is trying to process the horror of what happened during the invasion and is trying to find peace in her own home again, she starts to realize that she might not know the people around her as well as she thought she did.—Laura_Ratings Meera and Henry are a married couple living in an isolated, ultra-modern house in Corrales, New Mexico, which Henry designed and built. Meera is a cancer survivor, and worries that the disease may return, but Henry is very understanding and supportive.
One evening, after returning home from a date night, the couple find that their house has been broken into and the living room trashed. The only things stolen are a laptop and their cell phones (which they left behind so as not to be a distraction during their date). After a visit from a detective (who, hearing pipes rattling, suggests they need a plumber), Henry installs a security system at the house.
A few days later, Meera is woken in the night by strange noises in the house, like rattling pipes. When she tries the lights, they do not work. Henry goes outside to check the generator and finds it has been smashed. He sees flashlight beams in the windows of the house and realizes the intruders have returned. Dashing back inside, he finds Meera bound and gagged in the bedroom. He releases her and they try to escape, but are pursued by masked men. Meera manages to get to the couple's car, but then hears gunshots from inside the house. A wounded man staggers outside, followed by Henry, who shoots and kills him.
The next day, at the police station, Meera and Henry are shown mugshots of the three intruders, one of whom is still alive and in ICU at the local hospital. They were all from the Cobb family, living in a rundown trailer park on the outskirts of town. They also learn that a young woman from the same family has recently gone missing.
Meera is left extremely traumatized by these events, and also by the discovery that Henry kept a hidden gun. Henry assures her he has got rid of it, and suggests that despite what has happened, they should go ahead with the housewarming party they had intended to give. With this in mind, he drives off to buy supplies for the party. Meera notices he has left his wallet, and when she cannot reach him by phone, she decides to follow him to the store. She soon catches up with his car, but to her surprise he turns off at the hospital. Distracted by this, she collides with another vehicle.
Meera's car is taken to the body shop and she takes an Uber home. She tells Henry what happened and asks why he went to the hospital. He tells her he just took a wrong turn.
With her own car out of action, Meera borrows Henry's car to get to work. In the car park, she meets the detective in charge of the case. He tells her the surviving intruder has died, so the case is now closed. Meera also learns that the man died on the night she followed Henry to the hospital.
Now deeply suspicious, Meera looks through the GPS record on Henry's vehicle and sees the Cobb home address. She goes there and manages to enter their trailer. Inside, she finds an envelope bearing the logo of Henry's construction company, with the address written in his handwriting. Meera opens the family's mailbox and finds a package containing a video camera. A neighbor appears and confronts her, saying he saw her car there a few days before and accusing her of ""snooping"". He seizes the package and bangs it against a wall. Meera grabs the package and leaves.
Back home, she tries to play the video, but it will not work properly; she sees only the image of Dylan Cobb. She orders another camera online, arranging to have it delivered to her work address. She decides to search Henry's office and finds a USB chip with photos of the construction of their house. Dylan appears in the photos as one of the construction team. Henry arrives home and so she has to cut short her search, but later that night she studies the photos again and this time sees images of Christine, the missing girl. The next day, Meera confronts Henry; she wants to know why an envelope with his handwriting was at the Cobb trailer, why he himself had visited the trailer, why he started keeping a gun, and how come he has pictures of the missing girl on his computer. Henry explains he was short of cash to complete building the house, and he committed fraud in order to get extra cash, but intended to repay the money. Dylan Cobb had worked for him, but Henry fired him after he saw Dylan ill-treating his daughter; Dylan was enraged and swore revenge, and also threatened to expose Henry's dodgy financial dealings. Henry had been paying Dylan to keep quiet, but after he stopped paying, Dylan and the other Cobb men broke into the house.
Meera is reassured by Henry's explanation, and happiness is restored. When the new video camera arrives, she is no longer interested in looking at the film she found at the Cobb home. Finally it is the night of the housewarming party, and with the house full of guests the party is in full swing. When Meera happens to see a TV news item about the still-missing Christine Cobb, her suspicions are reawakened. She gets the new video camera and plays the tape. On it, Dylan Cobb talks about how he did not like the way Henry looked at his daughter, and that after Christine went missing, Dylan went to Henry's house with his dog, which started barking furiously in the vicinity of the office.
Meera goes to Henry's office and finds a hidden switch, which opens a secret door to a basement. Down in the basement, Christine is discovered bound to a chair, attached to pipes by chains; this is the cause of the mysterious banging noises which have occasionally been heard in the house. Meera tries to free the girl, but Henry arrives in the basement before she succeeds. He tells Meera that he has always had perverted urges, but that he did not choose to be this way. Meera finally realizes that the reason Henry built their isolated home was so he could have a secret place to keep his victims. She attempts to call 911, but Henry overpowers her and ties her up. Back upstairs, he tells their guests that Meera has had too much to drink and has gone to bed, and he sends the guests home. Meera manages to get free of her bonds and she also frees Christine. Henry comes back down to the basement while they are trying to escape, and a chase ensues. Henry knocks out Meera and drags Christine back down to the basement. There, he ties her up again and is about to kill her with a baseball bat, but instead he is fatally wounded when a revived Meera appears and smashes him in the head with a clock. Ironically it is a clock he had given her as a special present on their first date. A dying Henry asks Meera what she will do when she no longer has him to take care of her; she replies that she will take care of herself. A final scene shows a sunny day and Meera moving out of the now empty house, and driving away."

Lucy also deals with Desi being out late, and tales and a picture in the tabloids about him being with another woman. He tells her he plays cards on a boat with some other celebrities and sleeps there when he is too tired to come home, and the picture is 6 months old. She reluctantly believes him. Frawley has Lucy understand that Desi's adultery may stem from her making the business and creative decisions on the show which makes him feel emasculated, though she tells everyone he makes all the decisions. She asks Jess to give Arnaz a producer credit hoping it will stop Desi's cheating and save the marriage. Oppenheimer, instead tells Desi that has top billing being the ""I"" in I love Lucy to placate him. Lucy confronts him, and Oppenheimer relents. The night of the live filming, a newspaper article deems Lucy a Communist, though she was cleared during a HUAC hearing months earlier. Lucy admits she registered as a member of the Communist Party, but Desi insists she lie and say she accidentally marked the wrong box to which she refuses. Desi cancels his usual warm up to inform the audience of the accusations. He takes a live call with FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, who assures the crew and audience that Lucy has been cleared of all the charges. As the couple celebrates backstage, Lucy shows Desi a handkerchief with lipstick on it. Desi says it's hers, but Lucy shows him another one with her own lipstick on it, proving Desi's infidelity. When taping begins, Lucy momentarily loses her concentration. They start over, with Lucy focused. The film ends with a title card saying Ball filed for divorce after the taping of the last show in 1960."

Eiffel,2021,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10366514/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The government is asking Eiffel to design something spectacular for the 1889 Paris World Fair, but Eiffel simply wants to design the subway. Suddenly, everything changes when Eiffel crosses paths with a mysterious woman from Arun's past. March 31, 1889 - Gustave Eiffel (Romain Duris) sits in his office, atop the newly completed thousand-foot (300-meter) iron tower he has designed and constructed - the Eiffel Tower.September 1886 - Eiffel receives an award for his ground breaking design for an iron skeleton to support the Statue of Liberty. He is made an honorary citizen of the USA in recognition for his achievements. Claire (Armande Boulanger) Gustave's daughter. Gustave's wife is dead and Claire wants to marry the young kid who is working in Gustave's office.
Afterward, he considers what his next construction should be, for the 1889 World's Fair in Paris. Two of his employees, Maurice Koechlin (Jérémy Lopez) and Émile Nouguier (Damien Zanoly), propose a 200-meter (656-foot) steel tower, but he turns down their proposal, favoring a Metro system for Paris. In order to get publicity for his enterprise, he contacts an old friend, journalist Antoine De Restac (Pierre Deladonchamps). At a society party, Eiffel meets Restac's wife, Adrienne (Emma Mackey). They have a strange, instant connection. Transfixed by her (& her challenge to build something audacious for Paris), Eiffel suddenly announces he will build a 300-meter steel tower, shocking the other guests.
It is clear that there is a history between Gustave and Adrienne.Bordeaux, 1860 - While building an iron bridge over the treacherous River Garonne, Eiffel dives in to rescue a construction worker who fell into the river. Eiffel demands wood for safety scaffolding from his superiors, but his request is turned down. Eiffel goes to Bourgès, a wealthy local businessman, to ask for the wood. Eiffel meets Adrienne, Bourgès' headstrong daughter. Impressed by having secretly witnessed Eiffel's heroism on the bridge, she speaks up in defense of his request for the wood and secures it for him.
Adrienne invites Eiffel to her birthday party. At the party, he is awkward, but she finds his aloofness attractive. He kisses her, then storms off, embarrassed. She shows up later at his office, saying she's attracted to him. Eiffel doesn't believe her and sends her away, so she throws herself into the river, to spite him. He rescues her and they make love and begin a passionate affair1886 - Eiffel presents his plans for the tower to the judges for the competition. There are some concerns if the ground is too soft for this mammoth structure, but Gustave presents a new technique to provide a foundation for the tower near the riverbed. He explains how the tower will be built and the fact that it is wind resistant and impervious to lightening strikes.
At the ceremony to announce the winner, as his name is announced, Eiffel and Adrienne instinctively hold hands. Restac sees this. Eiffel begins construction of the tower. At a garden party, he dances with Adrienne and asks her to meet him at a cheap hotel in the country. She refuses. As construction continues, the workers threaten to strike.
Adrienne realizes Restac has become suspicious of her. She searches his things and finds a cartoon belittling Eiffel's tower. Out of jealousy, Restac is using his position as a top journalist to sabotage public opinion against the tower. Restac subtly warns Eiffel about this. With uncertainty clouding the whole undertaking, the workers at the tower go on strike.
Bordeaux, 1860 - Eiffel learns Adrienne has left town and runs to her house, where her father tells Eiffel she was just stringing him along, and that she never wants to see him again.1886 - Adrienne shows up at the cheap hotel. She reveals to Eiffel that the reason she left him 30 years ago was that she was pregnant with his child, and her parents forbade her to marry Eiffel, or ever see him again. She raced from the house to be with him, but as she tried to escape over the fence, she fell and was impaled on a spike, losing the baby and almost dying. Eiffel realizes Adrienne has always loved him and they make love.
When the banks threaten to pull funding for the tower, Eiffel finances the tower with his own fortune. Seeing Eiffel is betting everything on the tower, the workers cease their strike. Gustave is a master engineer and uses an ingenious system of sand and air based hydraulics to ensure that the 4 pillars of the tower align at the first level.
Adrienne visits the completed first level and she and Eiffel kiss above the rooftops of Paris.Restac, who married Adrienne and nursed her back to health after her family abandoned her, is aware of her affair with Eiffel. He tells her he will ruin Eiffel's reputation and destroy the tower's chances of completion if she doesn't end the affair. Adrienne tells Eiffel she has agreed to leave the city with Restac, to protect Eiffel and his tower.Furious and powerless, Eiffel, orders the tower's construction to be completed with rivets instead of bolts, so it can never be torn down. He pushes his team to exhaustion and finishes the tower in time for the World's Fair.
At the grand opening, Eiffel sees Adrienne in the crowd. After they briefly make eye contact, she leaves, knowing she has sacrificed everything so his masterpiece can be completed.
Returning to the opening scene, Eiffel writes in his journal in his office atop the tower. He sketches atop a diagram of the tower, adding letters beside it, to form the name Adrienne. It suddenly becomes apparent that the tower is in the shape of the capital letter ""A"". Eiffel has made the tower a permanent monument to their love. He walks out and surveys the city, which sprawls beneath him."

Martin Lowery is a scientist sent to a government-controlled outpost while an unspecified pandemic has ravaged the country. The outpost is located in an unusually fertile forested area outside Bristol to help in the studies and experiments of his former colleague and ex-lover Olivia Wendle regarding using mycorrhiza to increase crop efficiency. After passing a physical examination and meeting his park guide Alma, he learns of the local legend of Parnag Fegg, a woodland spirit. The following morning, Martin and Alma begin their two-day hike toward Olivia's site.Alma informs Martin that Olivia has not been heard from in months. The pair come across an abandoned tent, with the remaining items indicating it belonged to a family. The next night, Martin discovers a rash on his arm before he and Alma are assaulted by unknown assailants who also raid their camp, destroy their equipment, steal their shoes, and loot some of their supplies. Without his shoes, Martin badly cuts his foot.They are approached by Zach, a man living in the woods who offers to lend the pair some shoes. Taking them to his own campsite, Zach disinfects and stitches Martin's wound and gives them both food and a drink. Martin and Alma begin to lose consciousness and realize they have been sedated. While they are unconscious, Zach takes ritualistic photos of them in strange clothes and positions and stitches a strange symbol and animal gut into Martin's arm.Upon waking up Zach describes the symbol as a mark to be seen by a presence in the woods, claimed by him to have once been an ancient sorcerer who placed his essence in a standing stone somewhere in the forest. Martin's foot becomes infected from his injury and Zach sloppily amputates some of his toes with a hatchet.Alma acquires a discarded blade to free herself and Martin before attacking Zach.

She reveals that Zach is her ex-husband, and that the pair were following the directions of a centuries-old book on local legends. He had been helping her to try and communicate with the presence inside the stone, using the lights and noises from an electronic soundboard, but disapproved of her approach and left.

They send Alma through the mist in a hazmat suit, but the spores make it through her protective clothing and subject her to horrifying visions. That night, the mist continues to close in on the site as Zach arrives, telling them to communicate with the standing stone using the sounds and lights as well as to consume a ""sacrament,"" a mixture of ground mushrooms alluded to in the book.Martin agrees to drink the sacrament and waits for it to take effect. Zach ambushes Alma and prepares to sacrifice Martin. Alma makes her way back to camp, where she finds Olivia in her tent surrounded by staged photographs of her and Zach's victims. Olivia attacks Alma, but she fends her off. Zach hears their struggle and rushes back to camp, where Alma kills him. She then pursues Olivia back to the standing stone as the mist overtakes the camp, and they are all subjected to more visions from the spores.By morning, Alma and Olivia suddenly find themselves far from the stone, broken out from their trances. Olivia, overcome with awe, collapses on the ground. Alma then approaches a waking Martin by the stone and, speaking with a distorted voice, she offers to guide him out of the woods.

Blue Bayou,2021,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11121664/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"As a Korean-American man raised in the Louisiana bayou works hard to make a life for his family, he must confront the ghosts of his past as he discovers that he could be deported from the only country he has ever called home. Antonio LeBlanc is an adopted Korean American and tattoo artist living outside New Orleans with his pregnant wife Kathy, a rehabilitation nurse, and her biological daughter Jessie. Due to his criminal record, he is unable to find additional employment to support his family, though Kathy offers to restart working to help make ends meet. After being physically harassed by NOPD officers Ace and Denny, the former being Jessie's absent biological father, Antonio is violently arrested. He is placed into ICE custody and faces deportation when it is revealed that his adoptive parents never naturalized him pursuant to Child Citizenship Act of 2000. Antonio and Kathy seek to appeal his deportation with the help of immigration lawyer Barry Boucher, who requests a $5,000 retainer. Barry warns, however, that if his appeal fails, he can never return to America again.
Antonio strikes up a friendship with Parker, a Vietnamese refugee with terminal cancer who came to America with her father when she was a child, and whose mother had died during the journey. After receiving a tattoo of ""Fleur-de-lis"" (a water Lily which references freedom - however never forget your roots as water lilies have roots but most people don't know this) from Antonio, she invites his family to a communal cookout at her home. Still unable to afford Barry's services, Antonio and his friends resort to stealing motorcycles and selling them, with Antonio nearly getting caught. Antonio pays Barry, claiming that the money was an advance from work, which Kathy finds suspicious. Barry tells Antonio that due to his criminal record and a lack of factors that would make his appeal favorable, his best chance is to seek support from his adoptive mother, who is still alive - something Antonio had hid from Kathy. Deeply hurt over this lack of disclosure and even more devastated by his refusal to contact his adoptive mother (due to her refusal to defend themselves against his physically-abusive adoptive father), she leaves with Jessie and moves in with her mother. Having begun to lose hope, Antonio severs his friendship with Parker.
Eventually, Antonio chooses to see his now-widowed mother, who appears apathetic and unwilling to appear for his trial. Antonio is fired by his boss at the tattoo parlor due to unpaid debts. He makes amends with Parker, whose cancer has gotten worse. When she falls unconscious, he takes her to the hospital. Kathy gives birth to her and Antonio's daughter, and they reunite. On the day of Antonio's hearing, Kathy, Jessie, Antonio's friends, Ace, and Antonio's mother, arrive to offer support. Antonio, unbeknownst to them, is abducted by Denny and his friends, who viciously assault him and leave him for dead. Knowing that he's guaranteed to be deported, Antonio attempts to commit suicide by drowning but cannot bring himself to do it. Denny brags to Ace about assaulting Antonio and making him miss his hearing, and Ace, disgusted, arrests him.
After saying his final goodbyes to his friends, Antonio is escorted by ICE to the airport for deportation to South Korea. Intending to go with him, Kathy and Jessie manage to locate him at the airport. Ace also arrives, wanting to say his farewells to Jessie, his daughter, before she leaves. Not wanting to displace his own family and not knowing where he'll be sent, Antonio tells them to stay in America. Unable to let go of an inconsolable Jessie, Antonio is forcibly separated from her as she cries out for him.
Real-life cases of other not naturalized adopted persons who are either facing deportation or have been deported are shown, along with the estimates by the ""Adoptee Rights Campaign of International Adoptees"" who face similar circumstances."

Stowaway,2021,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9203694/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A three-person crew on a mission to Mars faces an impossible choice when an unplanned passenger jeopardizes the lives of everyone on board. The crew of a spaceship headed to Mars discovers an accidental stowaway shortly after takeoff. Too far from Earth to turn back and with resources quickly dwindling, the ship's medical researcher emerges as the only dissenting voice against the group consensus that has already decided in favor of a grim outcome.—Theo Rich After taking off from Earth, the hand-picked, highly trained team of astronauts--Commander Marina Barnett, biologist David Kim, and medical researcher Zoe Levenson--embarks on a two-year scientific mission to distant Planet Mars. However, in their attempt to make the celestial body habitable and find a possible new home for humankind, the crew is not alone. Now, with the flight past the critical point of no return and the fuel and oxygen resources depleting, Marina makes a shocking discovery: the hidden, unconscious, and wounded fourth passenger, Michael Adams. Suddenly, having enough oxygen to breathe becomes the number one priority, and while faced with an agonising ethical dilemma, someone has to die. The question is, who?—Nick Riganas The first five minutes the crew is shaking uncontrollably, but trying to maintain their cool, during takeoff. The crew begin to get adjusted to the habitat, getting themselves settled. Before long, the commander/pilot Marina sees some blood on the floor, looks up, unscrews a panel, discovers a stowaway (Michael), bleeding badly, who is larger than the space accommodates, and he quickly falls down on top of her, breaking her arm. Some equipment behind his body in the compartment appears damaged. The crew wonders if he stowed away intentionally, but this plot point is never answered; he claims he does not remember and someone would have had to screw the panel down from the outside after he was 'in' in any case. Zoe, the doctor, sews him up, with help from David, the scientist. The stowaway is somewhat hysterical upon regaining consciousness, having left his disabled (we never learn exactly how) sister behind alone, on Earth; as a result of his reaction, the crew decides he did not stow away on purpose. There are a few brief scenes where Michael eats with the crew and works alongside David, though he is clearly not qualified to be aboard a space ship as an astronaut.Michael is the largest person on board, and Hyperion (the NASA alternative/private space company) is not able to figure out how he got on board, nor how to fix the oxygen scrubber that was permanently damaged by the stowaway's body, he used up extra fuel and oxygen in takeoff that was not planned for, and there are NO replacement parts. Marina asks David to work on increasing his algae project, using up all the resources that were intended for his research project on Mars, to try to produce enough oxygen for even three of them to survive without the scrubber. Concurrently, Marina tries to get Hyperion to come up with a solution (besides offing Michael) and they (with all the world's best minds) can't come up with anything that would allow them to survive the journey. Zoe wants to give Michael extra time while they try to find a solution anyway, David and Marina do not, but they compromise on 10 days, and are ordered to tell Michael nothing. Frustrated at the life threatening risk Michael's presence poses to all the lives of the approved astronauts, David comes up with a lethal injection and offers it to Michael, with an explanation. But Zoe finds Michael, trembling with the injector, and stops him from doing it. She accuses David of not caring, but David (who has a wife at home) has sacrificed ALL of the raw material for his scientific mission for two years in the hope of keeping them all alive, and half of his algae died. He asks what she has done. The other half of the algae dies and there is now only enough oxygen for two people to survive. The commander orders Zoe and David to go out in space (Michael can't physically do it, for lack of training; it does look extremely difficult and something that would take a long time to learn to do well) They try to walk down long cables hooking the main spacecraft to the rocket which launched them off, in the hopes of filling tanks two tanks with remaining liquid oxygen from the launch craft. Each tank can hold liquid oxygen for one person for the whole trip. Zoe succeeds in filling the first tank, and is working on the second tank, but SOLAR STORM! They have to rush back or die from radiation. They rush back and the first tank, which is in no way tethered to Zoe flies off into space just as Zoe and David make it back aboard. The oxygen tank on the launch craft is leaking and Marina says the solar storm will last five hours. Zoe volunteers to go back and fill the second tank. If she succeeds she can save the three remaining astronauts, as she would die due to the radiation. She makes it down, fills it up, brings it back up, then dies of solar radiation.."

On Thanksgiving night, a group of disgruntled toy store employees begrudgingly arrive for work to open the store at midnight for the busiest shopping day of the year. Meanwhile, an alien parasite crashes to Earth in a meteor. This group of misfits led by store manager Jonathan and longtime employee Ken soon find themselves battling against hordes of holiday shoppers who have been turned into monstrous creatures hellbent on a murderous rampage on Black Friday. Several employees at a big-box toy store are infected by an alien substance while preparing for Black Friday. On the day of, and after customers are allowed inside, the remaining employees discover that the infected have turned into zombies. While some employees work on closing the doors and eliminating the infected, others defend themselves from a zombie in the bathroom. The group realizes that the infected are building something in the middle of the store. What can be more dangerous than zombies?—Frank Liesenborgs A parasitic organism attacks All-Mart employee Monty as he prepares the store for its Black Friday sale. Monty mutates into a monster and attacks two co-workers. Because he has to work on Thanksgiving, Ken Bates drops off his daughters Lyla and Gracie for dinner with their mother and her new husband Grant. Ken then picks up his co-worker Chris Godecki and drives to their late shift at We Love Toys. While anxious shoppers assemble outside, Ken and Chris join co-workers Marnie, Brian, Archie, Ruth, Emmett, Anita, and Bircher as they get ready to open the store for Black Friday. Bircher accidentally locks himself outside the building while smoking a cigarette. Possessed by a parasite, a rabid shopper mauls Bircher, causing him to transform into a creature too. Store manager Jonathan Wexler has his employees open the doors. Shoppers pour in, but they gradually turn violent as the parasitic mutation spreads. Everyone eventually realizes that the shoppers are transforming into murderous creatures as they are attacked and forced to fight back. Possessed by a parasite, Emmett emits a tentacle that kills Anita. Emmett turns into a creature before fleeing toward the store's Santa's Village display. Ruth holes up in the office while Archie leads Chris and Brian through a mutant horde to close an exit door before more shoppers get inside. Jonathan and Ken battle a creature in the bathroom. Marnie sneaks into Santa's Village and sees that transformed shoppers are being assimilated into a growing sac. Once the exit door is secured, Jonathan, Ken, Chris, Marnie, Brian, Archie, and Ruth regroup on the store floor. Driven by a possessed officer, a speeding police car crashes through the front window.

With Chris unable to start the truck, he and the others fight off another mutant before making their way to the roof. Meanwhile, the building catches fire as the main sac continues growing into a massive monster that soon fills the entire store. Jonathan sacrifices himself to a horde so Chris, Marnie, and Brian can escape back down to the ground. Brian confesses he bit Ken in the earlier commotion, so Ken is not actually infected. Having assimilated all of the mutated shoppers, the massive monster breaks through the store's roof. Brian tries to confront the creature, but it kills him. Ken re-joins Chris and Marnie outside. Ken acts as a distraction while Chris tricks the monster into swallowing a forklift, which causes the injured creature to collapse into the fire. Ken, Chris, and Marnie escape in Ken's car.

Queenpins,2021,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9054192/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A pair of housewives create a $40 million coupon scam. A team of FBI agents burst into the home of Connie Kaminski (Kristen Bell) to arrest her. Her voiceover narration says that she is getting ahead of herself in the story, so she goes back to the beginning.Almost a year earlier, Connie is shown being jobless and saving money with coupons. She is married to IRS agent Rick (Joel McHale), who is unpleasant and unsupportive toward Connie, only telling her to get a job instead of being home stocking up on products that she bought with coupons. They have also tried to conceive a child, but Connie suffered a miscarriage and they are paying off debts from fertility treatments. Connie is best friends with Joanna ""JoJo"" Johnson (Kirby Howell-Baptiste), who lives with her mother, Mama Josie (Greta Oglesby). JoJo has been unable to secure proper employment since she had her identity stolen, so she makes YouTube videos to try and generate revenue. The local mailman, Earl (Dayo Okeniyi), has an obvious crush on JoJo.After a particularly frustrating day, Connie writes a complaint letter to General Mills about the Wheaties she ate being stale, and soon, she receives a coupon for a free box of cereal. She then learns from JoJo that companies do this all the time, so she writes multiple complaint letters to receive multiple free coupons. The ladies then learn that the coupons come from a factory in Chihuahua, Mexico, and they hatch a plan to head down there and collect the coupons to redistribute to other moms and wives.In Carson City, Nevada, Ken Miller (Paul Walter Hauser) works as an agent to prevent losses for certain stores and companies. He chides a woman at a store for attempting to use a fake coupon for a discount, even though the cashier is willing to let it slide. Ken travels back to his home in Salt Lake City, where he is just lonely.Connie and JoJo make their travel to Mexico and encounter a couple, Alejandro (Francisco Rodriguez) and Rosa (Ilia Paulino), who agree to help them out by taking the unused coupons. Once they get their hands on them, the ladies begin their own website and small business ""Savvy Super Saver"", which helps them sell a lot of coupons and generate profit. However, this also catches the attention of Ken, who learns about the coupons and the losses some companies are taking. Ken annoys his superiors until he makes it an official case that he can take on.The ladies' account is frozen due to suspicious activity, so Connie finds out they need to prove they are a legitimate business. With that, they must turn to the hacker that stole JoJo's identity, Tempe Tina (Bebe Rexha). They get in touch with Tina and are taken to her secret location, where she instructs Connie and JoJo on how to keep their operation lowkey and how to keep their money secure, including by using JoJo's cosmetics brand Back 2 Black as a front for their coupon business.After six months, Connie and JoJo figure their money is safe to use, but because it's dirty money, they need to spend it and clean it. They start buying things like sports cars, boats, planes, and guns. Meanwhile, Ken is partnered with a rep from the post office named Simon Kilmurry (Vince Vaughn). Tempe Tina then contacts Connie and JoJo for their overspending and tells them that their money was always clean, and now their purchases are just making them look more suspicious. Tina tells them to take money out from the bank in small increments and to get rid of all their big purchases.JoJo later takes Connie to the fertility clinic where she decides to give it another shot at getting pregnant. Instead of using Rick's sample, she uses an anonymous donor instead. They later sell off their guns to a militia.Ken and Simon bond on their mission, with Simon sympathizing with Ken for how much devotion he puts to the job. They go around interviewing people from grocery stores where the ladies have shopped, and almost all of them recognize Connie because they find her constant use of coupons to be irritating. They are even able to place her behind the super saver website because their slogan is the same phrase that Connie uses when she shops. When they interview a group of postal workers, they remember JoJo because Earl is always watching her videos. He ends up trying to warn her while Ken and Simon try and stake out by her house.After gathering more evidence on the women, Ken and Simon are able to get agents to go and arrest Connie and JoJo. The two are placed in jail, but while JoJo is let out on bail, Connie is only visited by Rick so he can admonish her for what she has done. Having had enough of his lack of support, she declares that she wants a divorce. The ladies are then put on trial, where JoJo is given ten days in prison plus a year of probation, while Connie is sentenced to eleven months, but possibly eight with good behavior. Ken thinks they were let off too easy, but the companies that the ladies ripped off just wanted the case swept under the rug to avoid bad publicity.JoJo begins a relationship with Earl and relocates to Montenegro where they can keep using the make-up business front and continue the coupon business there to avoid the law. Connie stocks up on goods in prison and has gotten pregnant. She continues to try and look on the upside as she makes it through her sentence. (thanks to Jeremy & themoviespoiler)"

Los Angeles, nowadays. Henry is a stand-up comedian with a fierce humor. Ann, an internationally renowned opera singer. Together, under the spotlight, they form a happy and glamorous couple. The birth of their first child, Annette, a mysterious girl with an exceptional destiny, will turn their lives upside down.—UGC Distribution Against all logic, Henry and Ann--he, a struggling stand-up comedian, she, a beloved opera diva--fall madly in love and become inseparable after a chance encounter in bustling, modern Los Angeles. However, all great romances are fraught with pain. Faced with the public's surprise and the dark side of success, Ann gives birth to gifted Annette: the fruit of their love, a miracle, a child prodigy, and the couple's damnation.—Nick Riganas The film begins with an introduction by its director, Leos Carax, and its writers, Sparks, in a recording studio. They, along with the principal actors, walk through the streets of Los Angeles and welcome the audience to the story.Henry McHenry (Adam Driver) is a stand-up comedian popular for being brazenly controversial and provocative. He tells a sold-out crowd about his new fiancé, Ann Desfranoux (Marion Cotillard), a famous opera singer. He says that he feels she has changed him, but doesn't know how yet. When prompted to say why he became a comedian, Henry says it was to disarm people, since making people laugh is the only way he can tell the truth without getting killed.Later, he picks up Ann from the stage door of the opera, where they are hounded by reporters. Henry mockingly dances for them.Ann and Henry sing about how much they love each other and how fast their romance has progressed- he has recently moved into her mansion, tucked away in the woods- and a showbiz news blurb tells us that they have gotten married.At the opera, The Conductor (Simon Helberg) works not as a conductor but as Ann's piano accompanist. He tells the audience about his dreams of conducting orchestras around the world, and his secret love for Ann. Ann, meanwhile, is happy with Henry, but feels that she doesn't know him- she sings that she fears him, yet doesn't know why.Ann and Henry soon have a baby girl, Annette. She appears to the audience as a wooden marionette puppet, but is treated by the other characters as a normal baby girl. Henry seems to be nervous and unsettled by the idea of fatherhood.While being driven to the opera, Ann falls asleep and dreams that six women come forward publicly to accuse Henry of abusive violence, and that Henry himself crashes into her car on his motorcycle.Henry returns to his tour in Las Vegas, and tells his audience that the morning of the show, he had killed his wife. The crowd is shocked and confused as he goes on to say that he tickled her to death in bed, before attempting to kill himself the same way. He seems extremely unstable and is booed off the stage. After seething backstage a moment, he rushes back onstage to scream at the audience, who scream right back. He realizes he's made a huge mistake- and the remainder of his tour is canceled as his career begins to nosedive. Ann's continues to flourish, though she still feels something is wrong and growing worse in her marriage.In a possible attempt to grow closer, Ann and Henry take Annette on a yacht trip that goes awry when they are hit with a massive storm. Ann soothes Annette below deck and finds Henry outside, drunk, in the middle of the storm. She tells him repeatedly to come inside, but he grabs her and insists on waltzing in the storm. Their struggle becomes more serious as Henry airs his frustrations over Ann's success and his own failings. As they fight, he appears to push Ann over the side of the boat, which kills her instantly.Henry rows Annette to shore in a lifeboat and waits for help. As they wait, the full moon begins to shine on Annette's face and she begins to sing a beautiful aria. Henry believes he must be imagining it and goes to sleep. We see the ghost of Ann, dripping wet, tell him that she will haunt him forever through Annette's voice.Later, the police question Henry about Ann's disappearance but quickly conclude it was an act of God, and there was nothing Henry could have done to save her. On the way home, Henry buys Annette a spinning lamp for her bedroom that projects stars across the ceiling. When he turns it on for her, she begins to sing again, and he realizes he was not imagining her strange gift.Meanwhile, the Conductor has finally become a conductor, and leads a rehearsal as he tells us his suspicions about Ann's death. He reveals they had had a brief affair the week before she met Henry, and that his love for her has never died. Henry invites him over to discuss Annette, and he feels obligated to attend despite his mistrust of him.Henry shows the Conductor Annette's gift, and proposes they take her on a global tour to sing for the world. The Conductor insists such a show would be exploiting Annette, but Henry brushes him off. Reluctantly, the Conductor agrees.Annette's ""miracle"" immediately becomes a worldwide sensation as they tour internationally. Henry seems to revel in the money and attention she has gotten back for him. The Conductor starts to take on much of Annette's care, as Henry goes out to party in the various cities they visit.Back in L.A., Henry returns home drunk to find that Annette is singing the love song he and Ann used to sing together. He turns on the Conductor, insisting he had no right to teach it to her. The Conductor says that he had written the song for Ann first, and in fact believes he could be Annette's father. Enraged, Henry attacks him and drowns him in the swimming pool, unaware that Annette is still awake.Henry decides to retire Annette from singing, but not before one final performance at the Hyper Bowl Halftime Show. Annette is flown into the stadium and introduced with much fanfare, but freezes up and will not sing. Henry watches as the music starts over several times but Annette remains silent. Finally, she says, ""Daddy kills people.""Time passes, and is Henry arrested for both murders and completely reviled by the public. At his trial, he refuses to go under oath because he says he will be killed if he tells the truth. He begins to hear Ann's voice and sees her above him, looking as she did when she was alive- they sing together about how Henry would change his actions if he could go back. She disappears and is replaced by the dripping wet ghost of Ann that has been following Henry; she tells him that she is the one who will be keeping him company in jail.Annette visits Henry in prison some time later. She sits in front of him, and as they begin to talk, he finally sees her not as a puppet but as a real little girl (Devyn McDowell). Henry attempts to explain himself, but Annette says that she doesn't think she can ever forgive him. She says he now has nothing to love, not even her. She is removed from the visiting room by the guard, Henry watching her leave through the window. He turns briefly to the camera and tells the audience to stop watching him. The puppet lies lifelessly on the floor."

What is initially a welcome rescue grows more suspicious as the son and his renegade father reveal a cultish devotion to the forest. But when their cabin is attacked by a strange being it's clear there is a far greater threat in this unrelenting wilderness. Gabi and Winston, two employees of South Africa's forestry service, are travelling along a river in the Tsitsikamma forest[3] when Gabi loses the drone she is controlling. Gabi decides to enter the forest, retrieve the drone and rejoin Winston later, saying: ""we can't just leave our trash here.""While walking through the forest, Gabi triggers a trap, which leads to a wooden stake piercing through her foot. Gabi removes the stake and heads deeper into the forest, which is soon covered by a red glow as night falls. She comes across a wooden house, and enters it to rest and recover from her injury. Barend and his son Stefan, two survivalists who had set up the trap and who live in the house, find Gabi resting in the house and treat her injury.Winston hears Gabi scream as she pulls out the stake, and he heads into the forest to look for her, but is unable to find her. After night falls, he encounters strange creatures in the forest, and becomes infected by a rapidly-growing fungus while hiding from the creatures.Throughout the film, Gabi grows close to Stefan, and she also experiences nightmares that involve fungi growing from her body, later finding patches of fungi growing on her arms and legs. She learns from Barend that he used to be a plant pathologist who started living in the forest after his wife Lily died of bone cancer thirteen years prior, and that Stefan was conceived in the house, which was where he and Lily had their honeymoon. Barend then states that he met ""God"" while in the forest.Later, Gabi is almost infected by a similar rapidly-growing fungus while sleeping, but she is saved when Barend wakes her up due to the creatures trying to break into the house. The creatures break in, and are revealed to be ordinary humans covered with fungus. Barend explains that the fungus infects humans and feeds on the eyes, mouth and lungs, and that they infect other people via spores. He also explains that the largest organism on the planet lives close to the house and is looking to spread, saying: ""She was here long before the apes started dreaming of gods.""The next day, Gabi finds Barend's writings, which compare humanity to monkeys in captivity. Barend provides offerings to a tree, which contains the previously-mentioned organism, and both he and Stefan eat some of the mushrooms growing in the tree. Barend and Gabi start heading out of the forest when Gabi finds Winston's flashlight, and they find Winston, who is now covered with several species of fungi. Winston, who is still alive, begs them to kill him. Gabi stops Barend from shooting him with an arrow. Barend then places an arrow in front of Winston's mouth which he impales himself on it. The noise attracts the attention of the creatures, forcing Barend and Gabi to return to the house.After finding lichen on her thigh, Stefan secretly gives Gabi one of the mushrooms that Barend has been harvesting from the offering tree.Stefan takes Gabi to see his mother, who has been transformed into an animate tree, and still has her wedding ring on one of her transformed fingers. Gabi goes through the photos stored in an SD card from one of the cameras she and Winston placed in the forest, and finds that several of the photos show the creatures. Barend reveals in a rant that he believes the world is doomed due to humanity's actions.Gabi and Stefan begin heading towards the city, but are confronted by Barend, who convinces Stefan to stay in the forest. Gabi begins heading back to the city alone, and Barend decides to sacrifice Stefan to the organism. However, Gabi changes her mind, and she returns in time to stop Barend from sacrificing Stefan; Stefan ends up stabbing Barend in the spine during their struggle. Barend is later shown with the fungus growing from his back and offering his own blood to the organism.Some time later, Gabi becomes infected by the fungus, and her body becomes covered with it. She begs Stefan to kill her, and it is implied that he does so. Stefan leaves Gabi's body in the house and heads to the city, where he has a meal and then leaves the restaurant; the leftovers of his meal quickly become covered with fungus. (thanks to Wikipedia)"

Her secret mission is to travel to a new planet, as mankind will be extinct in the near future due to a deadly virus. The virus also killed her husband, Léo.Heartbroken by the truth, she deduces the awakening was due to a processor overheating and realizes she must divert the functions of the processor to another processor assigned to non-essential functions, but initially fails since the data exceeds capacity. As time passes by and with oxygen levels fading, she prepares for suicide by attempting to open the pod. Shortly after, she discovers Léo is also in hypersleep in the damaged spaceship together with nearly 10,000 others, but she notices he lacks a scar on his forehead that he had before. Upon further investigation, through a video presented by an elderly version of her, it is revealed that she is a genetic clone with the original Elizabeth Hansen's personality and memories implanted, including memories of Léo. The woman she has been speaking to on earth is the original, and now elderly, Elizabeth Hansen.MILO activates a euthanasia protocol due to a non-existent chance of survival, however Elizabeth's clone manages to deactivate it and successfully diverts the functions of the processor and is put back in hypersleep. The final scene shows the clones of Léo and Elizabeth on the new planet smiling, embracing each other."

Alan guesses correctly that both were enrolled at the school, but he insists that he was completely unaware of the abuse; Mandrake does not believe him and implies that they are driving to the boy's home. When they stop at a gas station, Alan attempts to secretly alert the station attendant, however Mandrake suspects this and kills the attendant by bludgeoning him with a fire extinguisher. Alan pretends to accidentally hit himself with the door while entering the car but as he kneels next to the car to ""recover"" he presses a nail into the back left tire.Jill attempts to escape, but is quickly caught and later forced to kneel underneath an overpass. Threatening to shoot her, Mandrake forces Alan to admit that he was aware of all of the abuse, but stopped and reported nothing out of cowardice.

Believing Mandrake to be that boy, he apologizes for not stepping in. Mandrake reveals that the boy wasn't him. He then shoots Alan in the chest and taunts him, but Alan hits him with a rock and bludgeons him. Mandrake survives, though wounded and disoriented, and tries but fails to kill Alan. Tubs, who Alan had talked to a few times implying that he only does what Mandrake tells him to, likening that behavior to still being in a boarding school, arrives and kills Mandrake with the rifle. He leaves the heavily wounded Alan, telling him ""I hate this place"", which is also carved into a stone behind Alan. Flashbacks had revealed that that carving was made by a traumatized boy growing up at that boarding school; whether or not that boy had actually been the tortured one is not explicitly shown. Tubs goes to an undisclosed location and looks out at the rising sun, silently crying. (thanks to Wikipedia)"

She was an ardent believer but often did things that were prohibited by her religion, so as to challenge the existence of God. She had an innocent theory that if any wrongdoing was committed, God would come and express His disdain, thereby proving their existence.Henry's mom takes her to her sister's (Danica Curcic). He meets his cousin named Rigmor (Ester Birch). In contrast to a quiet Henry, Rigmor was a chatterbox. She had this knack of filling even the darkest moments with her exuberance. Henry is told to go to school with Rigmor. They are accompanied by another little girl named Eva (Ella Nilsson). Both the girls are inquisitive about why Henry is keeping quiet and why he keeps looking at the sky. Their cherubic aura had the potential to darn any hole effortlessly. Rigmor makes an argument that even Eva saw somebody die in front of her eyes but she could still speak, and so Henry would be able to speak too, if he tried.Meanwhile the Shell house has resistance inmates such as Svend Nielsen (Casper Kjær Jensen).Crossing roads beneath the open skies was a task for Henry, but Rigmor had a solution for it. She took the rope from her home, which was used to hang wet clothes. She ties it to Henry and starts pulling, whereas Eva pushes Henry from behind. The mission is accomplished, and the kids are hopeful that soon Henry will be able to do it without the rope.
Henry slowly learns to smile once again and starts gaining back his lost confidence. The credit was to be given to Rigmor and Eva. Childhood is a phase where you don't stop dreaming even after you wake up. As we grow up, the power of belief somewhere fizzles off. The girls had no doubt in their minds that Henry was going to get better.Teresa meets a Gestapo officer named Frederik (Alex Høgh Andersen). His moral turpitude was not taken well by his own father, who couldn't take the fact that his son was helping the Nazis. Teresa sees him for the first time when he is beating a member of the resistance movement. She tells him that he'll burn in hell. The way she said, stirred something inside Frederik. He meets her again, where she asks him to kiss her. She tells him that he is a devil and that if God existed, he would come and stop her. A forbidden romance brews between the two. The irony is that their relationship feels as virtuous as it could be, and though Teresa was on the path of breaking her vow of celibacy, it seems right.Eva's father scolds him in the morning for not having her porridge. She leaves for school without eating anything. It was the same day that the British forces decided to bombard the Gestapo Headquarters. Low-flying aircraft, accompanied by 30 Mustang fighter bombers, were to strike the Shell House. Though they were able to strike the Gestapo Building, they accidentally also bombed the school where Henry, Eva, and Rigmor used to go. Eva was feeling uneasy due to a lack of food in her system, so she headed out to the washroom. Henry accompanied him. Though Frederik had left the forces, he came back to help after seeing the bombardment.Teresa and Rigmor were stuck inside the rubble, and water was filling up the claustrophobic space at a quick rate. Frederik almost saves Teresa, but as soon as the stone on her body is removed, she jumps in the water to save Rigmor. The delicately placed rubble gets displaced, and Sister Teresa and Rigmor are not able to survive. Henry and Eva were lucky enough to survive.
Henry is given the task to write down each survivors name, age and color of the dress and run to the theatre to relay this information. The theatre is where all parents have been asked to sit, while they wait for information to come in.Henry, who was helping the rescuers, tells Eva's mother that she had gone home. Her mother scampers back to find her eating the same cold porridge for which she had been scolded by her father earlier that morning."

You Are Not My Mother,2021,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10406596/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"In a North Dublin housing estate Char's mother goes missing. When she returns Char is determined to uncover the truth of her disappearance and unearth the dark secrets of her family. An opening flashback scene shows Rita Delaney taking her infant granddaughter Charlotte (""Char"") into the woods, while the baby's mother Angela protests. In the wood, Rita sits the baby on the ground and lights a ring of fire around her. She watches as the baby screams.In the present day, the teenage Char lives with her mother and grandmother; her uncle Aaron lives nearby and visits occasionally. The household is somewhat dysfunctional; Rita is in poor health, Angela is depressed and spends much of her time in bed, and there is no food in the house. Char attends a girls' Catholic high school. Although academically gifted, she does not fit in with the other students, who consider her their social inferior, and she is subjected to bullying. One morning, driving Char to school, Angela tells her daughter that ""she can't do this anymore"". Her car is later found abandoned, with no sign of Angela. The family report the disappearance to the police, but they are not able to offer much help. However Angela returns within a few days, strangely altered. Her depression is gone, and she is cheerful, dressing up and cooking dinner for the family. Rita seems suspicious of these changes in Angela and deliberately upsets the pan of soup that Angela had prepared, so the family are obliged to eat the chips that Aaron has brought over instead. But Angela appears to have little appetite and sits staring sullenly at her mother.Char witnesses several instances of increasingly bizarre behaviour in the ""new"" Angela and becomes frightened. Her uncle Aaron is poisoned by Angela, which leads to him being hospitalised. In the meantime Char is forging a friendship with one of her former bullies, Suzanne. Char confides in Suzanne about the changes in Angela; Suzanne in turn tells Char how her own mother died when she was very young. One evening Rita tells Char the story of her past; when Char was a baby, Rita realised she had been swapped with a ""changeling"". The only way to get the real Char back was to place her near fire, hence the fiery ring ritual in the woods. This worked, but Char sustained a small burn to her cheek. Her family told her the resultant scar was a birthmark.Rita tells Char that the ""new"" Angela is also a changeling, and thus the fire ritual must be repeated to get the real Angela back. Although Char appears to agree, when she sees Angela bound and gagged and tied to a bed she is appalled. Despite her grandmother's protests, Char frees Angela, only to realise too late that Rita spoke the truth, and that this is not the ""real"" Angela. The changeling kills Rita. Char runs out of the house, but is waylaid by the school bullies, who force her inside an unlit Halloween bonfire. However the bullies are scared off by the approach of the changeling Angela. Angela pushes her way into the bonfire to get to Char, but Char sets the structure alight. Angela burns while Char is rescued from the flames by Suzanne. In the final scene, Angela is restored to her true self, and Char makes her a lucky token from twigs ""to keep her safe"", as her grandmother had once made for her. Mother and daughter are happy to be together again, ready to move forward with their lives. (thanks to Wikipedia)"
We're All Going to the World's Fair,2021,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt13648224/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Alone in her attic bedroom, teenager Casey becomes immersed in an online role-playing horror game, wherein she begins to document the changes that may or may not be happening to her. Late on a cold night somewhere in the U.S., teenage Casey sits alone in her attic bedroom, scrolling the internet under the glow-in-the-dark stars and black-light posters that blanket the ceiling. She has finally decided to take the World's Fair Challenge, an online role-playing horror game, and embrace the uncertainty it promises. After the initiation, she documents the changes that may or may not be happening to her, adding her experiences to the shuffle of online clips available for the world to see. As she begins to lose herself between dream and reality, a mysterious figure reaches out, claiming to see something special in her uploads.—Sundance Film Festival Obsessed with a mysterious online horror game, vulnerable teen Casey plucks up the courage to take the viral World's Fair Challenge, the internet's scariest dare. Now, there is no turning back. And as Casey tries to decipher her symptoms, waiting for something to happen, a voice emerges out of the ether, encouraging the shy girl to continue. But is the creepy stranger a friend or a foe?—Nick Riganas Casey, a lonely teenage girl living with her single father, sits in front of her laptop camera, practicing introducing herself and announcing her intent to participate in the viral ""World's Fair challenge."" She turns off all the lights in her bedroom except for her desk lamp before reapproaching the camera holding a stuffed toy lemur. She starts recording a video where she recites her introduction and states her intent to take the challenge, and introduces the lemur toy as ""Poe,"" whom she says will also be taking the challenge. She says she ""doesn't know what to expect."" She turns off her lamp, says ""I want to go to the World's Fair"" three times while staring directly into the camera, and stabs her finger with a pinback button before smearing her blood on her laptop. She then watches a video of colorful, flashing strobe lights, staring unblinkingly into the lights as she does so. She thanks her viewers and promises to post updates if she starts to ""notice any changes.""Casey later views other videos related to the World's Fair challenge. These include a young man who has taken on the challenge and claims he's ""turning into something,"" and a video in which a mysterious, distorted voice asks if the viewer wants to join ""the internet's scariest online horror game"" before warning the viewer, ""we can't be held responsible for what you become."" The voice also says that ""if other players like the direction you're taking the story, they'll help you expand it further"" - implying that the World's Fair challenge is merely an elaborate alternate reality game and that all the videos from users who claim to be experiencing ""changes"" are dramatized. Casey later watches another video of a man sitting on his bathroom floor, stating that a game of Tetris is being played inside of him. Casey pauses the video to look up the most common ""symptoms"" players have experienced after starting the challenge. She clicks on a video entitled ""I can't feel my body!"" uploaded by a user named Keith. In this video, a shirtless Keith is running on a treadmill and repeatedly slapping himself, but appears to show no physical reaction to the stimulus. Another video entitled ""I am turning to plastic"" then begins playing, of a doll-like young woman with smooth, glistening skin dramatically posing for the camera while ambient pop music plays. As she watches the video, Casey's father pounds on her door and berates her for watching videos at three o'clock in the morning. Casey apologizes to him and shuts her laptop, but still does not go to sleep.The next day, Casey ventures into the woods near her house, where she continues recording. She explains to her viewers that she took the challenge because she loves horror movies and thought it would be cool to try living life as if she was in one. She explains that she would often sleepwalk as a child and have very strange dreams due to the scary stories she would invent in her head. She also notes that even though the temperature outside is cold, she does not feel anything. At home, she records another video where she says she's going to film herself sleeping that night. She subsequently gets into bed and struggles for a bit to fall asleep before reapproaching the camera, stopping the recording, and slamming the laptop shut. She puts her hat and coat on and goes outside, carrying a lantern. She approaches her father's barn, picking the lock to get in, and finds his shotgun. She sits down on the couch in the barn and begins to watch an ASMR video, which she projects from her phone onto the wall, of a young woman soothing the viewer and telling them to go back to bed after they had a nightmare. After the ASMR video ends, another video begins playing, entitled ""A message for Casey from JLB,"" uploaded by a user called JLB. The video contains a distorted image of Casey's face that becomes increasingly more disfigured as the video progresses, played over sounds of demonic laughter. The words ""YOU ARE IN TROUBLE"" and ""I NEED TO TALK TO YOU"" then flash on the screen.Casey watches one of JLB's videos, in which he states that he loves collaborating with other players, but warns the viewer that his channel is strictly ""in-game"" and that only ""serious players"" are welcome on his channel. Casey calls JLB on Skype. He apologizes for frightening her with his video, explaining that he didn't know how else to get her attention. JLB then explains that he's been following her videos and asks how much she's read up on about the challenge. Casey says she's only really watched others' videos on it, and JLB states that the history of the World's Fair challenge is actually much deeper than it appears. JLB says the challenge is like a conduit that is able to access the players' subconscious minds, and that he has witnessed it do things to players that Casey could not comprehend. Casey asks why JLB has reached out to her, and he says he wants to help her, but asks her to promise that none of the statements she made in her video in the woods were false. She agrees, but is unable to explain further when JLB prompts her to. Casey says that she can ""feel herself leaving her body,"" as if the challenge is turning her into a new person entirely. JLB asks her to keep making videos so that he knows she is okay, and she agrees before he ends the call. The movie cuts to a shot of JLB in his own room, revealing him to be a middle-aged balding man. Much like Casey, he spends most of his time watching other World's Fair videos. He watches a video made by the same man who claimed he could feel Tetris being played in his organs. The man talks about a plush doll of Stitch from Lilo & Stitch he yearned to win from an arcade as a child. He then shows a series of green scales that have begun growing across his arm, and pulls a long strip of arcade tickets from underneath a patch of scales. JLB then plays a pixel game based on the World's Fair challenge before watching another video. Dramatically shot in the style of a horror film, the video consists of a young man talking to his friend on the phone, imploring him to not watch a video, as ""it's getting stronger."" His friend ignores his behest and performs the same ritual that Casey did at the beginning of the movie. A pair of hands reach out of his laptop screen, cover his mouth as he cries out in horror, and pull him into the laptop. Another video from a user named Rebecca, entitled ""Demon Wings,"" consists of a young woman staring wordlessly into the camera with a pair of black, feathery wings sprouting from her back.JLB then makes another video for Casey, in which he records a voiceover over one of her videos. Casey's video is another attempt at recording herself sleeping, as she ""needs to figure out what's going on."" At around 4:55 A.M., by JLB's estimate, Casey appears to wake up, but does not move at all aside from widening her eyes and grinning madly as her lamp shines on her face. JLB says this video is Casey's most disturbing one yet, and implores her to continue making them so he can still monitor her well-being. Casey later uploads another video entitled ""losing control of myself."" In it, she gleefully sings and dances around her room to a karaoke version of a pop song, but inexplicably begins convulsing and screaming in terror in the middle of the song before continuing to dance as though nothing has happened. She then uploads a video entitled ""a tour of my high school,"" where she actually just films herself walking through a cemetery and refers to the headstones as lockers, desks, and faculty offices, respectively. Casey's next upload, entitled ""guess where i am today,"" consists of her standing on the side of the road and filming cars that go by, ultimately zooming in on an AutoZone across the street. In her next upload, ""dumbass waterfall,"" Casey films a stream near her house late at night while promising the viewer that someday, she will ""disappear,"" and nobody will ever be able to discover what has happened to her. In her next upload, ""random thought,"" Casey films herself walking from a downward angle. She comments on the gun that her father keeps hidden in the barn, and on the fact that he foolishly believes she is unaware he has it. Her next upload, ""hey how was your Christmas?"", consists of Christmas lights and decorations that people in her area have put up. She focuses the camera on a wooden cutout of Santa Claus, commands it to ""stop smiling,"" and insults it.Casey later uploads another video of her sleeping; this is the sixth sleeping video she has made thus far. In the middle of it, she wakes up, eerily crawls towards the camera, and says, ""I see you there, even if you won't show your face. You can't stop me."" This message is presumably directed towards JLB, who is shown to be watching the video in his own bedroom. JLB makes another video addressed to her, where he admits that he spent most of the holiday season thinking about her and rewatching her videos in search of ""clues."" He then states that he senses the ""forces of the fair pulling her in closer with each upload,"" and that he wants to save her. He asks her to send him a message once she watches his video.In Casey's next video, her mental state seems to have gone somewhat back to normal. She shuffles a tarot deck and pulls some cards before she explains that the person watching must be a ""lonely person"" who ""seeks comfort in the things they cannot have."" She also states that the viewer struggles with ""mental issues,"" such as anxiety, and is trying to deceive people by ""walking around like they know everything."" She says she hates people like that, then asks the viewer ""How strong are you really? How powerful are you really?"" She thanks her viewers for watching and ends the video. In her next video, Casey films a walk through her town at night on New Year's Eve, stating her intention to use her father's gun to either kill him or herself. She then asks the viewer, ""Why won't you help me?""In her next video, Casey sets up her camera on a tripod in her bathroom and films herself sitting in front of her mirror, smearing toothpaste under her eyes. The video after that consists of Casey with her face and arms completely covered in green glow paint with all the lights in her room off. She holds Poe, her lemur doll, up to the camera and speaks for him in a high-pitched voice, introducing himself to the viewer and saying he loves them. Casey then confesses that she is afraid of the dark and that Poe, who she has had since she was a newborn, helps her sleep at night. She then tears him apart and turns her light back on, but tearfully expresses regret when she sees the ruined toy. She lies down on her floor cuddling the remains of Poe and staring listlessly up at her ceiling.While on another Skype call with JLB, she says she ""knows how it's gonna end now"" - she is going to be transported inside her computer. She inquires if JLB is familiar with the strange loop theory, which JLB says is just one theory out of many, but Casey insists that she has always had a looming suspicion that her life has just been one long, continuous dream that she needs to wake up from. JLB then asks if Casey has heard of an entity known as ""Ka-Rom,"" who aims to ""trap"" Casey inside the ""fairgrounds"" and is only deceiving her into believing the strange loop theory to achieve this outcome. Casey asks JLB how much time he estimates is left until she commits suicide. He does not answer, instead saying he needs to ask her a question, but that the two of them need to ""go out of game"" for him to do so. Casey asks what he means by that, and he explains that they must briefly break character and stop operating as if the World's Fair is real. Initially appearing upset and confused at the insinuation that the World's Fair is purely fictitious, Casey agrees. JLB expresses his concern for her, but Casey states that the World's Fair is a horror game, so it only makes sense that her videos would contain unsettling subject matter. JLB says he is empathetic to her plight, as he himself struggled with suicidal thoughts as a teenager, and admits that he considered contacting the police to do a wellness check on Casey, but refrained because he doesn't know where she lives. Casey is horrified to learn that JLB assumed her suicidal and homicidal ideations were genuine, and tells him Casey isn't even her real name before abruptly ending the call. She messages him demanding that he never speak to her again and accusing him of having a pedophilic attraction to her. JLB goes into his living room, where he mutters incomprehensibly to Casey as if she is still there, before going back to his bedroom and trying to call her again. His attempts at contact are immediately rejected. He messages her ""please don't do it,"" and asks her to continue making videos.Sometime in the future, JLB makes another video stating that a year after the events of the film occurred, Casey reached out to him on Skype again, whereupon she apologized for distancing herself from him and explained that she spent a few months in a psychiatric institution, and only just recently felt emotionally stable enough to message people again. They shared their real names with one another before Casey revealed she was soon to attend a theater program in New York City. They met in person for the first time in Manhattan, getting coffee and making awkward small talk. As they prepared to part ways, JLB felt confident enough to ask her about the occurrences of that night, but she interrupted him and apologized for the things she had said, which he forgave her for. He then recalls that Casey told him, ""That night, I made it there. I know it sounds crazy, but it's true. I made it there, to the planetarium, across the crowds, into the heart of the fair. But something brought me back. I don't know what it was."" JLB then confessed he stayed up all night praying for her safety. Casey said she knew, as she could feel it. At that point, they got pizza together and made plans to meet up again to see a movie before sharing a hug and parting ways. Whether or not this meeting actually occurred or is merely a story fabricated by JLB is left unclear."
Finding 'Ohana,2021,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10332588/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A summer in rural O‘ahu takes an exciting turn for two Brooklyn-raised siblings when a journal pointing to long-lost treasure sets them on an epic adventure with new friends, and leads them to reconnect with their Hawaiian heritage. Hawaiian siblings Pili and Ioane ""E"" were New York-raised in Brooklyn. An avid geocaching fan, she wins a competition that earns her free tuition to a summer camp in the Catskills. Pili can't go in the end as they temporarily relocate from New York to Oahu with their mother Leilani to help her father, Kimo as his health and financial issues are becoming serious.As Pili is so into geocaching, her malaise at being separated from her beloved New York is assuaged by secretly liberating an old diary from her grandfather's art studio, set up in an old bus. Just as she's sneaking off the bus, she meets local boy Casper who helps cover for her.That night, as Pili is trying to secretly read the diary, E catches her. He explains the term Night Watchers to her, trying to scare her, explaining they are ghosts of fallen warriors who protect the island.Meanwhile, E is distracted from his own search for better Internet signal by local girl Hana, who is Casper's friend. She, on the other hand, is not impressed by his attitude towards the younger kids.In the diary of the ship the Peruvian's quartermaster Monks, he documented Robinson and Brown's excursion on the island. The privateers had mutinied, burned their ship and taken the treasure ashore. Monks stayed to protect the treasure while his superiors died. He gave the diary to Pili's ancestors for saving his life.Kimo catches Pili with the diary. Initially angry, he ends up taking the enthusiastic girl to see some of the landmarks in it. He falls, breaking a rib. While Leilani is distracted with Kimo in the hospital, Pili and Casper sneak off to seek the lost pirate treasure. E and Hana follow close behind.They end up having to follow the instructions in the diary as all four slide inwards of a cave too far to back out. They have to crawl through a narrow tunnel, it's opening is called 'The Jaws of Death' and it is lined with stalactites. Fearing a deadly spider, E hurries frantically out of the tunnel, leaving behind the ship journal as it's inside Casper's backpack as it collapses. Finding a mini rope bridge over a lava-filled crevice, they realize it's too deteriorated to cross, but the fearless Pili and Casper inch around it on a narrow ledge. E helps Hana maneuver around it, partially by distracting her singing a favorite song.E confides in Casper that the brown violin spider bit him, leaving him with a huge blister, possibly indicating necrosis. To not alarm the others, he covers it with duct tape. Arriving to a pool, they realise the next tunnel is filled with rain water. Pili gets through it piggybacking on E.Arriving at 'ground zero', Pili and Casper go in search of the treasure while E talks with Hana. He tries to convince her to send in her application to Julliard, but she fears it might change her too much. Pili and Casper examine the complex pulley and rope system they had remembered from the journal. Realizing one of the counterweights is down, they deduce they can access the treasure room by putting all of their weight on the severed rope.Once in, they all are collecting large amounts of gold and jewels, when Hana spots a religious statuette indicating they are in a type of tomb. Realizing the treasure is an offering, she insists they can't take anything without waking the Night Watchers. When E refuses to believe it, they awaken.All four drop their treasure and head for the pools below using the banyon roots. Everyone makes it, although E has to be resuscitated. As they move away from the mountain Leilani catches up with them. The Night Watchers approach them as they seek shelter in a shed. Pili makes an offering with a few treasures she'd kept. They are bowing down, averting their eyes when their father Kua steps out. He had died 11 years ago while enlisted. Leilani, Pili and E have a brief moment before Kua and the other Night Watchers disappear into the ocean.Leilani calls a family meeting and proposes they decide as a group if they all stay in Hawaii or Brooklyn. We then see videos of the happy family staying in Hawaii and Ioane and Hana are a couple. (thanks to Wikipedia)"
Cosmic Sin,2021,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11762434/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Seven rogue soldiers launch a preemptive strike against a newly discovered alien civilization in the hopes of ending an interstellar war before it starts. In the year 2524, four centuries after humans started colonizing the outer planets, retired Gen. James Ford gets called back into service after a hostile alien fleet attacks soldiers on a remote planet. The threat against mankind soon escalates into an interstellar war as Ford and a team of elite soldiers try to stop the imminent attack before it's too late. Prologue:In the year 2031, the first colony of Mars is founded. By 2042, the Alliance was formed and quantum propulsion technology allows humanity to travel beyond the solar system. Unfortunately, the Mars colony fails in 2281 and the Alliance controls the three colonies: Earth, Zafdie, and Ellora. Zafdie attempts to secede from the alliance in 2519; James Ford, The Blood General, drops a Q(uantum)-Bomb on the rebel colony, killing 70 million people. After learning the horrible atrocity of what Ford did, Dr. Lea Goss (romantic partner) leaves him and he becomes dishonorable discharged from the military. In space, the Sigea are an invasive alien species that invades and conquer other worlds. They can parasitically infect and control their hosts by forcing their victims to ingest a black fluid that turns the host into an agent of Sigea and operate with a hive mind.Main story:In the year 2524, the Vander Mining Corp was stationed at planet 4217LYA (Heracles System) when Captain Juda Saule (Eva De Dominici) reports of an alien encounter to the Alliance. On Earth, General Eron Ryle (Frank Grillo) gets the call of the alien contact and wants Dr. Goss and Ford in on the situation. At a local bar, Dash (Corey Large) was meeting with Ford (Bruce Willis) for a job when civilians picked a fight with the Bloody General when Commander Marcus Bleck (Costas Mandylor) appeared. Bleck requested his presence but Ford refused; he relented when Bleck mentioned he'll get reinstatement. At the McMillian Airfield, Dash tags along with Ford and have a meeting with Dr. Goss (Perrey Reeves) and Ryle about what happened in the Heracles System. Survivors of the Vander mining operation were sent to the airfield for debriefing, but Goss raised concerns. The survivors were under Sigea control and started killing security. The soldiers fought back and won, but at the cost of 53 lives. What happened to Vander and their base was considered an attack on humanity and the Alliance is to strike back; Operation: Cosmic Sin is a go. Ford, Ryle, Goss, Braxton, Bleck (Brandon Thomas Lee), Dash, and Ardene (Adelaide Kane) travels to Ellora by a Quantum Jump Gate to stop the Sigea.While entering Ellora, Ryle's suit gets damaged and presumed dead when he didn't make it with the team. Ford and Goss got separated from the group during entry and Bleck gets mortally wounded shortly making it to the surface. As the team struggle to take out their attackers, Elloran survivors aided them. Sol Cantos (C.J. Perry) was escorting survivors when she encountered the team. After verifying they're human, they agreed to help take them to the orbital cannon to give Bleck treatment. At the Alliance outpost, the surviving team learns about how the Sigea infect and control people. Ford made it to the outpost to find Bleck dying; he euthanized Bleck to help him die easier. In a meeting with all surviving soldiers, they talk about their situation and plan to use the Q-bomb they brought. Ardene believes if they can get the orbital cannon working again, they can launch the Q-bomb into space and collapse the gateway to seal off the Sigea once and for all. In space, Ryle was able to reach out to Ardene through the coms. With him stuck in space, he volunteered to help detonate the gateway to seal off the Sigea.The Sigea knows the survivors are holding up at the orbital cannon and converge on the outpost. Goss was captured and infected; she's now an agent of the Sigea. Goss gives them a chance to surrender, but they refused. The survivors along with the soldiers make their last stand, to hold up the outpost as long as possible for Ardene to fire the cannon. While the rest fend off the alien attackers, Ford latched on to a Sigea ship and followed Goss to the gateway. While facing Goss, she said there was never going to be peace. Ford was repelled back to Ellora while Goss drifted through the gate. At the cannon, Braxton found Ryle prepared to sacrifice himself to close the gate.

Three stories about the world of opioids collide: a drug trafficker arranges a multi-cartel Fentanyl smuggling operation between Canada and the U.S., an architect recovering from an oxycodone addiction tracks down the truth behind her son's involvement with narcotics, and a university professor battles unexpected revelations about his research employer, a drug company with deep government influence bringing a new ""non-addictive"" painkiller to market. Three stories about the world of opioids collide: a drug trafficker arranges a multi-cartel Fentanyl smuggling operation between Canada and the U.S., an architect recovering from an OxyContin addiction tracks down the truth behind her son's involvement with narcotics, and a university professor battles unexpected revelations about his research employer, a drug company with deep government influence bringing a new ""non-addictive"" painkiller to market.—yusufpiskin Teenage drug runner Cedric Beauville is captured and arrested by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police on the Canada-United States border in possession of large quantities of illegal Fentanyl pills.Everett University research scientist Dr. Tyrone Brower (Gary Oldman) is contracted by Northlight Pharmaceuticals to carry out a study in support of their newest product, Klaralon. The drug is being touted as the first non-addictive painkiller and is due to be released shortly as a replacement for Oxycodone. The study uncovers concerning results; Klaralon initially presents as non-addictive when taken daily for the first 7 days (parameters specified by Northlight), however after 7 days it becomes almost three times more addictive than Oxycodone. Realising the public health implications, Brower recommends to Northlight they delay Klaralon's release for further testing, which they object to.
Board member Dr. Bill Simons (Luke Evans) tries to tempt Brower into changing his mind by offering a large research grant ($780,000), but Brower refuses. With Northlight being one of the university's main donors, Brower finds himself under pressure from department head Geoff Talbot (Greg Kinnear) to approve the study, but again is reluctant. Northlight begins leaking information to discredit his reputation, and Everett University revokes his tenure. Desperate, Brower becomes a whistle-blower and contacts the FDA, being put in contact with investigator Ben Walker (Scott Mescudi).Detroit based DEA agent Jake Kelly (Armie Hammer) has managed to infiltrate two large scale drug cartels running Fentanyl. One is run by the Armenian Mafia who operate pill mills across the US. The other is based in Montreal, Quebec controlled by drug kingpin Claude 'Mother' Veroche (Guy Nadon), who operates out of a nondescript restaurant called La Marina. Kelly intends to convince the two cartels to enter into business, so both leaders can be arrested at once when they meet. Kelly has personal motivation for bringing them down, due to his younger sister Emmie (Lily-Rose Depp) suffering from crippling heroin addiction. Kelly's relationship with Mother becomes strained when news of Cedric's capture comes to light, with Mother becoming concerned there is an informant in his organizations.
Jake provides a report to his department. He says that the American mafia has recruiters who bring people from the homeless shelters to the clinics which are manned by doctors who prescribe Oxycodone. The recruiters are people who are paid $100 per recruit. The homeless ones have medicare cards and their prescriptions are covered by the govt. The doctors prescribe Oxycodone for any reason what-so-ever. Now the cartels are pushing Fentanyl, which 100 times more potent than heroine. They want to control Fentanyl distribution in the US.
Due to operational funding concerns, Kelly's superior agent Garrett (Michelle Rodriguez) gives him a reduced timescale to organize the meet between the two cartels.
Mother has Cedric killed in police custody for his silence (before he starts taking names), and executes his second in command Guy Broussard (Éric Bruneau) after discovering he has been speaking with the Canadian Mounty Police (Due to his information, the Canadian police was able to intercept the run by Cedric). Mother indicates to Kelly that the bust on the border was impossible without an insider, as it was not a patrolled stretch.
Kelly offers to buy $3 MM worth of Fentanyl from Mother on behalf of the Armenians, to entice Mother to come for the meeting. He knows Mother needs distribution. He tells the Armenians that they can turn the $ 3 MM into $30 MM on the streets easy. He offers to put $ 1 MM from his end, which is later authorized by Garrett.Architect and recovering Oxycodone addict Claire Reimann (Evangeline Lilly) becomes concerned when her 16-year-old son David does not return home from hockey practice. He is later found dead as a result of a Oxycodone overdose, shocking Claire who is convinced he never took drugs. Although the Detroit Police Department treats it as an accidental death (there were 40 overdose deaths in Detroit alone that week), she hires a private investigator who determines David was forced to take the Fentanyl (His lungs were perfect pink, which means no inhalation) and was murdered (there was trauma to the back of his head).
Through her son's social media she tracks down one of his friends, who confesses several teenagers from the hockey team (from both Detroit and Montreal) work for Mother as drug runners, although David had only done it once. Reimann crosses the Ambassador Bridge and travels to Montreal where she hires another private investigator, who provides her with information on Mother and an untraceable ghost gun. She threatens another drug runner, Derrick Millebran (Duke Nicholson), who believes that Mother is killing them to tie up loose ends after Cedric's arrest.
Kelly becomes aware of Reimann's activities through investigation of Cedric's associates, and intercepts her outside La Marina. He does not arrest her, but instead unloads her gun and urges her to leave for her own good.The meeting between the two cartels goes ahead, covertly monitored by a joint DEA-RCMP task-force. However, an RCMP surveillance officer accidentally gives away his position, resulting in a shootout that kills Kelly's partner, Special Agent Stanley Foster (Nicholas Jarecki). Mother also escapes, believed to have fled to Algeria. Given the seizure of the drugs at the meet, both US and Canadian agencies decide to disband the continued search for Mother and the Armenians. Outraged, Kelly goes against orders and travels to La Marina, where he threatens an employee who tells him Mother is still in Canada but is planning to escape via seaplane that evening from the Port of Montreal. Reimann is also given this information from her private investigator. Kelly arrives at the port, but has been beaten there by Reimann, who opens fire and kills Mother as he makes his way to the aircraft. His bodyguard shoots her in the arm, but is swiftly shot by Kelly. He then replaces the men's weapons with Reimann's ghost gun and his own unregistered back up gun, to make it appear they shot each other in a disagreement over money that was being carried by Mother at the time. He treats her gunshot wound, and tells her he does not intend to arrest her.A last ditch effort by Northlight CEO Dr. Meg Holmes (Veronica Ferres) also fails to convince Brower to come on side, and the company is subjected to an FDA hearing. To Brower's shock, the agency does not revoke Northlight's permissions for Klaralon's release, noting that the potential benefits to the public outweigh the dangers highlighted by his study. Walker is also reassigned as a retaliatory measure. Despite the legal risk, Brower breaks his non-disclosure agreement and goes to the press, finally getting the information public. His integrity and honesty pays off, and he is later hired by the University of Michigan due to his actions, and is seen giving an introductory lecture to a crowded auditorium."
Horror in the High Desert,2021,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt13964404/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"In July 2017, an experienced outdoor enthusiast vanished in Northern Nevada while on an outdoor excursion. After an extensive search, he was never located. On the three-year anniversary of his disappearance, friends and loved ones recall the events leading up to his vanishing, and for the first time, speak about the horrifying conclusion of his fate. In the style of a documentary film, the first part focuses on the police ""missing person"" report of amateur hiker Gary Hinge: Toward the end of July 2017, Gary hiked to an unspecified area in the Great Basin Desert (Nevada). His starting point was the town of Ruth and his target was presumably a cabin he had approached on a previous expedition. When he was two days past his estimated return date and did not return home, his housemate Simon Rodgers alerted Gary's sister, Beverly Hinge, who in turn notified the police. More than a week had passed since Gary had last been seen.Initially, the police conducted a search based on the last GPS location of Gary's cell phone. Local and state police were involved, as well as park rangers and even volunteer groups. A few days later, it was reported that Gary's truck had been found, 55 miles from his departure in Ruth, Nevada, at the end of a dirt road at the bottom of a small hill. This finding prompted search parties, who covered large areas on foot, by helicopter and with the use of drones. None of the groups were able to find any trace or indication of Gary's location. When several more days passed without any news, the police terminated the search, as they considered that the chances of finding Gary alive were already practically nil, due to the fact that he used to travel with minimal supplies, water and equipment, which left him at the mercy of the weather (the hottest time of the year) and other dangers, such as the local fauna or the fact that there are multiple abandoned mining pits in the area. As time went by, the media stopped reporting on it. Subsequently, Beverly hired a private investigator, William 'Bill' Salerno, so that the case would not be abandoned. A reporter from a local media outlet, Gal Roberts, decided to convince her editor to keep on top of the story, lest it be forgotten as a ""cold case"".Thus, the investigation then focused on the clues that could be obtained from the truck, now considered a crime scene. Two aspects stood out; first, numerous fingerprints that did not match Gary Hinge's were found all over the truck, especially on the steering wheel. In addition, a trail of barefoot footprints, also not matching Gary's, was found. Since the John Doe's fingerprints did not match any database, the police found themselves at a dead end. In parallel, Bill Salerno started digging into Gary's social networks and Gal Roberts finds a promising clue in the video blog where Gary used to post his hiking and survival adventures, under the alias ""Scorpion Sam"". The hiker had some 50,000 followers, a fact unknown to his family and people close to him. Several of his readers believe they have some idea about Gary's final whereabouts, and that the question about his final destination could be related to some of his publications.In the next to last of the published videos, Gary appears in frame from his home, narrating a very unusual experience, which had left him very disturbed: In his last excursion, he had been walking for three days in an unknown area, when he noticed the smell of smoke. Following that trail, he found a dilapidated-looking cabin, as if abandoned, but with smoke coming out of an old chimney. However, a sense of ""imminent danger"" caused him to move away from the site and make camp away from the area. The next morning, Gary reported that he found a trail of barefoot footprints, and on the way back to his truck, he felt he was being watched, and even felt he was being followed. This publication had a lot of comments, most of them negative, where followers expressed serious doubts about Gary's account, questioning why he had not recorded anything and did not present any evidence; another large number of comments were from users demanding him to give the coordinates of the place and another part of the visitors of his blog challenged him to come back. Feeling the victim of cyber-bullying and visibly affected, Gary recorded and uploaded one last video, explaining that he would not give the exact location of the mystery cabin, since he did not want to encourage inexperienced people to venture into those desert regions, and informed that he would return to the site, accompanied by his video camera and a gun for protection.White Pine County landscape.
Several weeks after the truck was found and search and rescue efforts were completed, a group of hikers in White Pine County reported that a backpack, which turned out to be the property of Gary Hinge, had been left at their campsite. Upon checking the contents of the backpack, aside from Gary's belongings and identification, his severed hand was found, still holding his video camera. Forensic analysis revealed that the hand had been severed from the victim while he was still alive, within a period of no more than five weeks. When authorities examined the memory card inserted into the camera, they discovered what happened to Gary on one fateful night.The footage found reveals that Gary was indeed able to find his way back to the mystery cabin; his first video entry was recorded at dusk, mentioning that he had been on the road for a day and a half and was sure of the route. Subsequently, he finds various markers he had left from his previous visit. Next, the following recordings consist of video fragments all recorded under infrared light, starting with Gary talking very frightened; he comments that he is already very close to the cabin and that he can smell smoke, as in the previous time. Suddenly, he hears chanting that seems to be a human voice, although it seems distorted. Once he finds the cabin, Gary confirms that it is the same one he saw earlier. While filming the outside of the cabin, Gary detects a human silhouette moving towards him. Being very careful not to make noise on the rocky ground, Gary tries to move away from the site, but is eventually spotted by a human-like being, but with severe physical deformities, who attacks him and the camera stops recording.Both the reporter and the private investigator speculate what or who might have attacked and killed Gary; it is mentioned that the police have made this footage public in the hope that someone in the audience might offer some additional clue, which has sparked a series of conspiracy theories linking Gary's disappearance to real or supernatural issues as diverse as Area 51, atomic testing, local Indigenous rituals, satanic groups or extraterrestrials. However, Gal Roberts expresses serious concerns about the fact that at least 17 social media accounts have taken it upon themselves to make expeditions to the area. Additionally, one of these groups is said to have posted that they have managed to find the trail of the cabin and its mysterious occupant, and that they will reveal the results of their expedition in 2022.

During the second innings when India is fielding, Madan Lal bowls toward Viv Richards who is on strike. Richards lofts the ball in the air for a six but results in getting caught out by Kapil Dev.The film then shifts to 30 May 1983 at the BCCI office in Mumbai where the BCCI officials get an invitation to the Cricket World Cup. Sunil Gavaskar is dropped from captaincy and Kapil Dev is made the captain. The cricketers who are in the squad namely Dev, Mohinder Amarnath, Kirti Azad, Madan Lal, and Sunil Valson are already there in England playing County Cricket.Along with the team manager PR Man Singh, the rest of the team which includes Gavaskar, Krishnamachari Srikkanth, Syed Kirmani, Sandeep Patil, Dilip Vengsarkar, Yashpal Sharma, Roger Binny, Ravi Shastri and Balwinder Singh Sandhu reach London where they witness the West Indies Cricket Team the two-time World Cup winners, being hounded by photographers at the airport. After they reach the hotel they join the rest of their teammates.The team fails horribly during the four warm-up matches which leads to doubts being raised about the performance of the Indian team in the group stage of the World Cup itself. During the press conference, Dev confidently tells the reporters that his team is here to win. During a training session of the West Indies team, the Indian team witnesses their four deadly fast bowlers namely Michael Holding, Andy Roberts, Malcolm Marshall, and Joel Garner who were known for delivering deadly bouncers to the batsmen. At the ceremony in Buckingham Palace, the Queen wishes the teams luck and the teams proceed for a group photograph. On the way back to their hotel on the bus, Dev gives an inspirational speech during the team meeting in accentuated English.The World Cup starts with India being placed in Group B alongside the strong teams Australia and West Indies. Zimbabwe who turns out to be making their World Cup debut is also placed in the same group. India unexpectedly win their first match against West Indies by 34 runs at Old Trafford, Manchester with Yashpal Sharma being the Player of the Match for his contribution of 89 runs (which was also the highest individual score put up by an Indian cricketer at that time).The teammates later celebrate at a bar that night. They also manage to win their next match against Zimbabwe by 5 wickets at Grace Road, Leicester thereby leading to the rise in the expectations of the Indian fans. Patil scores a half-century and Madan Lal is named as the Player of the Match.However, the team becomes over-confident and loses their next match against Australia by a huge margin of 162 runs. Dev is disappointed with the team's performance, especially with Roger's performance, and Gavaskar is unable to play due to his leg injury.With Gavaskar's absence, the following match with West Indies turns out to be a brutal one as in the first innings, Viv Richards thrashes out the Indian bowlers severely thereby making a score of 119 runs off 146 deliveries. The second innings seems to be more violent when Malcolm Marshall bowls deadly bouncers to the Indian batsmen and one of the bouncers hits Dilip Vengsarkar on his chin, injuring him. Mohinder Amarnath puts up a score of 80 runs by bravely facing the bouncers but India lose the match by 66 runs.The morale of the team is shattered. It is further shattered as Vengsarkar is ruled out from remaining World Cup matches due to his injury which resulted in seven stitches. The disheartened team in the bus is stuck on the route because of the West Indies crowd celebrating and blocking the way. However, they see a young Indian boy waving a homemade Indian flag which moves the team to tears and raises their spirits.The next match against Zimbabwe on 18 June at Trent Bridge, Nottingham is a do-or-die one as India will be eliminated from the tournament if they lose. The wives of the cricketers also turn up to show their support as it is thought to be their last match. Gavaskar is back in the team recovering from his injury. India opens up with a shaky start, making 9 runs at the cost of 4 wickets. Dev steps in a hurry onto the field without the helmet as he was taking a shower. While walking to the pitch he sees the disheartened Indian crowd. He then starts scoring runs but the wickets keep falling. During the lunch break, Dev takes out the Mongoose bat which enables him to hit more powerful shots and gives a better counterattack to the bowlers. He then starts hitting boundaries continuously. Dev then makes a world record of 175 runs (which was previously 171 runs made by Glenn Turner in the 1975 World Cup) and is received with a standing ovation from the crowd and the umpire. India makes a score of 266 runs which Zimbabwe fail to achieve which leads to India winning the match by 31 runs and also retaining their place in the tournament.A party is held by the High Commissioner in which all the team members show up except for Binny who does not turn up because he is disappointed by Dev constantly chiding him for his bowling performance during net practice. At the party, Srikkanth jokes around and humorously tells the crowd that Dev had gone mad because he told them that they would beat the West Indies which is the strongest team in the cricketing world, but then he says that he has faith in his captain and he would only go home with winning the World Cup.The final Group Stage Match with Australia at County Ground, Chelmsford on 20 June is an easy win for India as they win by a huge margin of 118 runs with Binny being the Player of the Match for his contribution of taking 4 wickets, praises Captain. India qualifies for the semi-final and this creates a wave of excitement across the country as India managed to qualify for the semi-final for the first time. The Prime Minister Indira Gandhi orders her ministry to ensure that every town and village in the country gets a television service so that the semi-final match can be broadcast.Before the semi-final, Sandhu is disappointed as his engagement with his fiancée Simran has been called off because of his living conditions and low salary. This affects his performance in the semi-final.During the semi-final with England, Amarnath and Kirti Azad choke off England's supply of runs by taking wickets. Azad takes the wicket of Ian Botham in which the ball surprisingly spins low towards the ground. England is restricted to a score of 213 all out. In the second inning Amarnath and Sharma build up runs for India, however, Amarnath is run out. During the partnership of Dev and Patil when 4 runs are needed to win, there is a premature invasion on the field by Indian fans. This causes the English captain Bob Willis to set his fielders on the left side so that they can escape if there is another invasion. Patil hits a four and India qualifies for the finals of the 1983 World Cup. Amarnath is named the Player of the Match.This creates further excitement back in India as this win was seemed as unexpected one. On 25 June at Lords, India faces the West Indies again for the final with the latter winning the toss and choosing to bowl. In the beginning, Indian batsmen are restricted severely by the bowlers with Gavaskar getting dismissed for 1 run, but Srikkanth aggressively scores 38 runs making him the highest scorer for the Indian team. However, the team is all out for 183 making it the lowest score in the World Cup final. Dev inspires his team to restrict the West Indies batsmen from scoring runs.The team steps onto the field with a rousing reception in the common room. In the second inning, Sandhu takes the wicket of Gordon Greenidge which gives India a lead. However, Richards launches a barrage of boundaries especially when Madan Lal is bowling. Madan Lal asks Dev to let him bowl another over as Richards underestimates him and Dev gives him another over to bowl. He bowls to Richards and Richards lofts in the air for six (as shown in the opening sequence of the film) but is caught out by Dev. This proves to be the turning point of the match. With Richards dismissed, the wickets of West Indies fall rapidly with Amarnath taking 3 wickets. When West Indies are 9 wickets down, Amarnath bowls to Holding who's the last batsman. Holding misses it and the ball hits his pads. Amarnath and the whole team appeal for the dismissal and Holding is given out leading to India winning the World Cup. The squad rushes towards the dressing room and the jubilant crowd rushes over on the ground and celebrations begin all over the country. A young Sachin Tendulkar back in Mumbai makes a promise that he would play for the Indian cricket team. Amarnath is named Player of the Match and Dev lifts the trophy along with the Indian team.As the credits roll, the real Kapil Dev is shown sharing his experience of winning the World Cup along with a montage of vintage photographs of the team."

In 1927 Sher Singh was sourcing weapons for the HSRA to conduct attacks against British colonists) and explores his reasons for assassinating Indian Civil Service officer Michael O'Dwyer. Sher Singh works with his idol Bhagat Singh (Amol Parashar), until he was executed in 1929 for throwing bombs at the central assembly hall in Delhi. In aftermath of the bombing the entire HSRA was eliminated and Sher Singh arrested and jailed.Udham Singh (known as Sher Singh) is released from prison in Punjab in British India.

Governor of Punjab (on how he forced 100,000 Sikhs to serve in WW 1 and how it is British burden to rule India, because without Britain it will revert to savagery) and how he had suppressed a major uprising (Dwyer believes that Dyer's decisive action in 1919 was crucial in suppressing a major rebellion against Britain).

His ashes were immersed where his idol Bhagat Singh's ashes were immersed. There is a statue made outside Jallainwala Bagh to honor Udham Singh and his courageous work.In the final scene, Gen. Dyer and O'Dwyer give their own accounts to the Hunter Commission. Dyer claims that Sec 144 and martial law were already in place (they were issued after the firing by Dwyer).

Chernobyl: Abyss,2021,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10648714/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A story about a heroic fireman who worked as one of Chernobyl liquidators. Chernobyl: The Abyss is the first major Russian feature film about the aftermath of the explosion at the Chernobyl nuclear power station, when hundreds of people sacrificed their lives to clean up the site of the catastrophe, and to successfully prevent an even bigger disaster that could have turned a large part of the European continent into an uninhabitable exclusion zone. The unlikely hero of the film is Alexey, a fireman at the power station. He is accompanied by Valery, an engineer, and Boris, a military diver, on a perilous mission to drain water from a reservoir under the burning reactor. They have no time for proper planning; water in the flooded corridors they will have to traverse is getting hotter by the hour as the molten reactor core seeps ever closer. Prepared to sacrifice their own lives in order to prevent an even greater catastrophe, the three men descend into the depths of the reactor building. Chernobyl: The Abyss is the first major Russian feature film about the aftermath of the explosion at the Chernobyl nuclear power station, when hundreds of people sacrificed their lives to clean up the site of the catastrophe, and to successfully prevent an even bigger disaster that could have turned a large part of the European continent into an uninhabitable exclusion zone.
The unlikely hero of the film is Alexey (Danila Kozlovsky), a fireman at the power station. Olga Savostina (Oksana Akinshina), a hairdresser is attracted to Alexey. They used to date 10 yrs ago, but have since drifted apart and met at a chance encounter at a hair dressing saloon in Chernobyl. Olga goes on a date with Alexey, but at the end of it Olga wont invite him home. So, Alexey barges in only to realize that Olga has a son named Alexey.
Turns out Alexey is Alexey's son, but Olga wants to hide this fact from her son as she considers Alexey immature. Alexey is leaving for Kiev and wants Olga and her son to go with him, but she refuses.April 26, 1986, 4th reactor of Chernobyl nuclear plant explodes. Alexey is first on the scene (he was on leave, but saw the explosion on hopped on the first fire truck he could find). Tigran (Samvel Tadevosian), firefighter has severe radiation burns after he was ordered to look into the open reactor to see whats going on. Tigran explains to Alexey that the reactor exploded, before he collapses and is taken away in an ambulance.
Alexey goes to the roof to find his missing friend Yura Kondratyuk (Dmitry Matveyev), fireman. Alexey is exposed to nuclear fuel and other materials on the roof. Alexey brings Yura down, but is suffering from radiation burns himself. There is no room in the ambulance, so he starts driving it, in order to get away from the power plant. Alexey is admitted to the hospital and spends the night thereThe next morning he is sought out by Dina (Ravshana Kurkova), a radiologist, who has been sent from Kiev to work with Alexey. Alexey's exposure was 14 rems and he was lucky. Dina asks Alexey to come with her as he knows all the pass-ways underneath the reactor.
At a Govt committee, Alexey learns that there are pools of water under the reactors. If the fuel melts the concrete and drops into the water, it will instantly vaporize into steam and that means another release of radioactive particles all over Europe. A team needs to go under the reactor and open the sluice gates to drain the water.
The Govt offers treatment in Swizterland and apartments in Moscow to those who take the assignments. The military wants to send 2 divers into boiling water, to turn the valves and open the gates (where 8 mins of exposure will kill the divers from radiation), but the civilians on the committee want to see if the electric motor that opens the gates is not flooded and can be used instead.
Alexey refuses to help as he says he was on leave since yesterday and his entire team is dead anyways.. Alexey finds Olga and Alexey. Young Alexey has radiation sickness (he saw the explosion at his fishing trip with his friends and was exposed). The town is being evacuated and they are ordered to leave for Kiev. On the bus Young Alexey starts vomiting and Alexey realizes his duty to safeguard other mothers and daughters and sons and decides to go back to Chernobyl.He meets the committee who is preparing for the dive. He meets the chairman Tropin (Igor Chernevich), and asks hi if young Alexey can be treated in Switzerland if Alexey decides to join the dive. Tropin agrees.Alexey is accompanied by Valery (Filipp Avdeev), an engineer, Nikita (Maksim Blinov), Ivan (Aleksandr Alyabyev) and Boris (Nikolay Kozak), a military diver, on a perilous mission to drain water from a reservoir under the burning reactor. They have no time for proper planning; water in the flooded corridors they will have to traverse is getting hotter by the hour as the molten reactor core seeps ever closer.
Nikita is hit by radioactive steam inside the passageways and dies. Valery refuses to go further, but is hit by Boris, who wants to complete the mission at all costs.Prepared to sacrifice their own lives in order to prevent an even greater catastrophe, the three men descend into the depths of the reactor building. The wire spool drops into radioactive water and Boris bravely goes in to retrieve it. The wire spool is required to provide electricity to the motor to open the sluice gates. The trio is able to connect the wires, but for reason the motor wont start. The trio have already been exposed heavily to radioactivity.
Boris says that the valve needs to be opened manually.
Boris is distraught that Nikita has died and runs into the passageway directly underneath the reactor. Further ahead he sees the nuclear fuel that has melted the concrete of the reactor and dripped into the passageway below and is slowly edging towards the water pools. Boris is fatally exposed (700 rems), but manages to close the steel bulkheads, sealing the magma.Valery and Alexey rescue Boris and get out of the tunnels and are rescued by the medical teams waiting at the entrance. Based on Alexey's report, army teams enter the reactor passageways to open the sluice gates. Boris dies.
At the hospital, Valery is told that he will have to dive into the hot water to open the valve. Valery was an engineer at the plant and the only one with enough knowledge to find the valves accurately.
Young Alexey is sent to Switzerland as promised for his treatment. Olga is not allowed to go with him and stays behind with Alexey.
Alexey goes back into the reactor with Valery. Valery and Alexey enter the scalding 140 degrees water and get to the valves. The valves are stuck with rust and the duo battle with it, eventually wringing it lose and opening the sluice gates. Valery dies during the attempt and Alexey cant save him. Alexey survived as the water receded and he was rescued. Alexey is radioactive and kept in isolation.
Young Alexey returns to Soviet Russia after 3 months."

In the year 2092, space is full of dangerous floating garbage like discarded satellites and deserted spaceships.

The crew of a space junk collector ship called The Victory discovers a humanoid robot that's known to be a weapon of mass destruction. They get involved in a risky business deal and travel through space looking for garbage they can make money off of while also competing with rival junk collectors.—yusufpiskin In the year 2092, Earth has become nearly uninhabitable. The UTS Corporation builds a new orbiting home for humanity that mimics the natural processes on Earth; however, only a chosen few are permitted to ascend and become UTS citizens, while those remaining on Earth breathe in polluted air and fight to feed their families. Under guidance from UTS founder and CEO James Sullivan, the company is working towards making Mars a new Earth, growing genetically modified plants on the planet and turning it into a hospitable environment for humans.To regulate the population in orbit and keep an eye on the non-citizens, UTS governs them via a strict set of rules and taxes. Many non-citizens from all across the globe work as space sweepers, collecting space debris floating in Earth's orbit and selling it to the company for survival. The plot follows such a crew of space sweepers and their ship, the Victory.Victory's crew has Kim Tae-ho, Tiger Park and Bubs (an android), all led by Captain Jang. Tiger Park handles the ship's machinery and was a drug baron on Earth. Bubs used to be a robot soldier but now helps repair the ship and cast the net for space junk while saving up to get a complete skin graft. Captain Jang was one of the child geniuses sponsored by UTS and created several hi-tech inventions for the company but, after discovering the company's true workings, became a pirate and tried to assassinate James Sullivan. Her crew was killed and Sullivan survived, so she changed identities and had an eye transplant. Tae-ho, once a child soldier, is on a search for his daughter (Su-ni) who was lost, ejected into space. His sole life aim is to pay for the authorities' recovery team to locate her body tracker before she drifts out of orbit and gets lost in space forever.After picking up a car floating in orbit, they discover a child in it. News reports say that she is a robot named Dorothy, and has a weapon of mass destruction inside her created by the terrorist group Black Fox. The crew also finds a smartphone in Dorothy's bag with several missed calls from someone named Kang Hyeon-u. They call back and, assuming the other party to be part of the Black Fox group, negotiate two million dollars for returning Dorothy. Tiger finds Dorothy drawing in his cabin and starts a conversation with her, as he finds himself drawn to her.Tae-ho and Tiger carry Dorothy to a night club to collect the ransom, but she wanders off in the crowd. UTS soldiers are lain in wait and a massacre ensues. Tiger and Tae-ho locate Dorothy when Soldier 01 zeroes in on them and shoots her blaster. Dorothy's eyes change color, and the trio are protected from the blast by a sort of force field around them. Captain Jang is watching everything through a feed on the ship. She also notices the man who came to collect Dorothy shouting after her and calling her Kot-Nim. As she watches Dorothy protect Tae-ho and Tiger, something clicks in Jang's mind. The trio make it back to the ship and Dorothy busies herself drawing and playing. When asked by Jang what her name really is, Dorothy says Kot-Nim is her Korean name. Tae-ho ignores her, thinking she is a robot, while Tiger becomes friendly with her and suggests keeping her. Tae-ho dismisses the idea and goes to set up another call with Kang Hyeon-u to rearrange the exchange.Dorothy and Tae-ho find tomatoes on the plant that Dorothy had helped revive from a dead tree, and sell them. Captain Jang finds papers in Dorothy's backpack and goes through them. Bubs puts makeup on Dorothy and tells her the story of Tae-ho. As a child soldier, Tae-ho was Soldier 01 at the age of 17. On one of his voyages, Tae-ho shoots and boards a ship that carries several fleeing non-citizens and kills them all. He notices a baby still alive in the arms of a dead woman and adopts the girl. She rekindles his humanity and Tae-ho finds himself unable to hurt others - as a result, he is dismissed from the force, made homeless and reduced to a non-citizen. After one year of homelessness, Tae-ho becomes desperate and gambles, neglecting Su-ni. She wanders away to find a snack, and while outside there is a debris impact that causes her to be blown into space.A masked man follows Kot-Nim to the toilet in the factory. Her screams alert Tae-ho and Tiger who rush to save her, but they are ambushed by a group of masked people. Tiger beats them all and Captain Jang intervenes, discovering they are other space junk collectors. Their leader explains that Black Fox is not a terrorist organization, but rather an environmental group, and that Kot-Nim is not an android but a human child. Born with a congenital disease, her father Kang Hyeon-u injected her with nanobots found in space debris to save her life. The nanobots helped treat Kot-Nim, but they also gave her a unique power: Kot-Nim could now communicate with other nanobots and heal and protect things. Sullivan found this out and used Kot-Nim to turn Mars into a healthy, green planet. He plans to kill Dorothy in a hydrogen bomb explosion (since nanobots can only be destroyed by breaking them into atoms through extreme high temperatures). Since it was close to Earth, the explosion would cause the factory to fall onto the planet, destroying the Earth and making Mars the only viable option for all humans.The crew decide to unite Kot-Nim with her father and disable the bomb, with the help of the Black Foxes who will locate and take Dr. Kang to the meeting point. Soldiers attack them, but Tae-ho and Kot-nim manage to flee on the Victory. They enter a space debris field while trying to flee, and nanobots surround their ship and begin to consume it. Kot-nim communicates with them, and the nanobots disperse. They enter the factory where the meet-up is scheduled, only to be ambushed. The UTS soldiers kill all the Black Foxes and Dr. Kang before taking Kot-Nim away. Sullivan leaves Tae-ho four million dollars in return for abandoning Kot-Nim. Tae-ho takes the money, but the rest decide to save Kot-Nim - even if it kills them. Tae-ho goes to give the money to the UTS officers and they hand over Su-ni's last found remains to him - her clothes, crayons and Korean writing book. In it, Su-ni had written that she wanted to be a good person like her father. This reminds Tae-ho of the promise he made to Su-ni, to be the best man she'd ever know. He takes back the money, and returns to the ship with a new zeal before they all go to save Kot-Nim.Sullivan goes live, announcing the Mars program. The bomb has been armed in the factory, and Kot-Nim is strapped to it on a chair. The team free Kot-Nim, but Captain Jang discovers that the bomb can not be defused. It will not only destroy anything in its blast range, but also destroy any nanobots in the vicinity of 5,000 kilometers. The only way Kot-Nim's nanobots (and so her life) can be saved is if she is out of range. The team sets off to fly 5,000 km away, but are interrupted by Soldier 01. Tiger fights with her and ejects her from the factory. The team send out a message to the rest of the Space Sweepers who come to their aid, fighting the attacking troops. The population of Earth learns of Sullivan's true goals when they hear him recount his plan through the Space Sweepers' emergency comms channel. The Victory is intercepted by Sullivan himself who, in a ship of his own, tries to fight the crew to get back Kot-Nim. When it seems they have lost the battle, Tiger and Tae-ho manage a final boost that puts the ship just out of the blast range. The crew reveal their real plan - Kot-Nim was safe with other Space Sweepers. The Victory had removed the bomb from the core and carried it away, ready to sacrifice their lives to save Earth and Kot-Nim. The bomb explodes; however, Kot-Nim has summoned the nanobots to protect the Victory, keeping the crew safe.In the aftermath of the battle, UTS apologizes for the cover-up of the true goals and promise to help make Earth more habitable. Kot-Nim is adopted by the crew and, using her powers, enables Tae-Ho to say goodbye to Su-ni. Bubs gets her skin graft. Tiger and Tae-Ho take Kot-Nim down to Earth to help grow trees and they all continue space sweeping."

The Zumba classes succeeds in fetching clients to the gym. Maanvi is the daughter of Brigadier Mohinder Brar (Kanwaljit Singh), and is from a rich family. But she works for her own identity.

However, at that juncture, Manu refuses to hear her out, and eventually they form a sexual relationship with each other.

His sisters, Preet and Meet, encourage him to propose Maanvi and marry her.When Manu eventually expresses his intention of getting married to Maanvi, she tells him that she is a trans-girl.

He comes to visit her in Chandigarh, and they have a heart-to-heart conversation about what is bothering her, and suggests that she stops going to the gym for a few days. To this, Maanvi questions why she is the one who needs to leave everything behind or hide herself to seek solutions to her problem.In the meantime, Manu educates himself regarding trans-women, by watching videos of trans-women, interacting with a trans-woman personally, and also seeks counseling along with his friends to come to the conclusion that his relationship with Maanvi is by no means, ""abnormal."" Being born in a male body was a biological defect that Maanvi had already rectified via surgery, and only Manu had to step up and accept her for who she was.In the meantime, Manu's sisters find out the truth about Maanvi's past (Manu was being frustrated and to figure out why they follow Maanvi to her clinic where she goes for periodic checkups and to refill her prescription), and insults her in public in front of her entire Zumba class (when Manu was not in the gym). As a result of the public humiliation, she is about to pack her bags and leave Chandigarh when she receives a phone call informing her of her father's heart attack. She rushes to the hospital, where Manu also shows up. He tells her that he wants to be with her, and even stands up to his family members (Mamaji (Tarsen Paul), Mamiji (Goni Sagoo)) for Maanvi. Manu tells Maanvi that he has understood that the past doesn't matter and it only matters who she is today and that he loves her. Manu's family threatens him to come back but Manu defends Maanvi and points out their own flaws to them, including his father's own affair.The next day, Manu is seen competing for the title of ""G.O.A.T"". Manu competes but trails Sandy by a big margin. Jomo texts Maanvi that Manu needs her.
In the last round of the tournament, Maanvi shows up to root for him. Being encouraged by her presence, he lifts up extra weights in a ""clean and jerk"", and wins the competition. After his victory, he asks Maanvi in front of the crowds, if she wants to be with him, and she says yes."

Naturally, all the characters are sure that the murderer is among them, and this situation further complicates when a seventh woman, Veronica (Micaela Ramazzotti), walks into the house. This new woman, who had actually been a long-time lover of Marcello, informs that she had been called up by some woman from the house who had told her something had happened to her lover and asked her to rush to the house.Each of the characters has their own secrets, which get revealed as the film progresses. Rachele, is introduced as someone who is unable to walk from the beginning of the film, as she needs to be pushed around in a wheelchair. However, this is later revealed to be her pretense of getting extra help and sympathy from everyone around, and she is actually able to walk very easily. Rachele is obsessed with her stocks, which are the only remaining wealth that she has. The woman always keeps the papers for these stocks under her bed, ensuring that they are always safe. A little while after the murder is discovered, these stocks are found to be missing, too, making Rachele suspect that one of the other women had not only killed her son-in-law but had also stolen all her money.
Next is Rachele's younger daughter and Margherita's sister Agostina, whose biggest complaint in life seems to be that no man has loved her till now. Agostina is revealed to have dearly loved Marcello, and she used to desire the man, too, despite the fact that he was married to her elder sister. Agostina had made multiple attempts to present her romantic thoughts to Marcello, but the man always avoided her advances in any way he could. Marcello himself was no less than a Casanova, as he had multiple lovers throughout his life, one of which was the new maid, Maria. The house used to have a different older maid earlier, who had strangely died one day after falling while she was cleaning the windows.
Maria had come into the house after this, as her sister used to work at a family house acquainted with Marcello's family and had subsequently fallen in love with the rich man. Margherita had no idea about this, but she, too, was tired of her married life since there was no love left between the couple. It is later revealed that Margherita was having an affair with Marcello's biggest business associate at the time, Sir Giannutri.On the other hand, Marcello always had a lover in his life named Veronica, even before he had been married to Margherita, and he kept in touch with Veronica even in present-day times. She had had to share her past lover Marcello, and her house with Margherita, since the house in which the latter and her husband lived was actually the family house of Veronica. But as fate would have it, Veronica also has to share her present lover with Margherita, for she, too, has been having an affair with Sir Giannutri.
Margherita's elder daughter, Susanna, has more than one secret of her own, one of which is a shock and surprise to her too. At present, she is pregnant with a child from her lover in Milan, and she keeps this news away from the family; this is soon revealed after some time. However, at this time, she learns that she is not the biological daughter of Marcello, whom she has always known to be her father, but was instead conceived by Margherita with a lover out of wedlock. It was while Margherita was pregnant with Susanna that she first met Marcello, who fell in love with her and married her soon after. Marcello needed Margherita's family fortune to buy his dream house.
Lastly, there is the younger sister, Caterina, but she does not seem to have any secrets or anything suspicious about her, except for the fact that she locks up her father's room after the discovery of his murder, stating that nobody should damage the crime scene before the police arrive. But as things turned out, Caterina had the biggest secret of them all.Through a series of confrontations among the characters, it is revealed that each of them had met with Marcello the previous night without letting the others know. The man had gotten into some financial trouble in recent times, for which he had asked for help from Rachele, knowing that she had stocks on her. But Rachele met with him the night before and told him that she was unwilling to help him by parting with her life's savings. Agostina tried twice to enter Marcello's room and tell him about a love letter she had written for him, but the man managed to avoid her both times. Maria did go meet him with his midnight tea, and this was a pleasant meeting for the man for a change, as he was in love with her. Margherita had visited to tell her husband of something she had been planning for quite some time now-Margherita wanted to leave Marcello and had been preparing to do so by the end of the year. On the previous night, she had told him of her decision, apparently causing more stress for the man. Next came Veronica, who had a key to the house and Marcello's room owing to the fact that she had always been his constant lover. But now, she asked for money from Marcello, telling him that she wants to go to Paris and will return his money later.Susanna, who had apparently only come from Milan on this particular morning, had actually returned from Milan the previous night itself, for she wanted to tell her father of her pregnancy. She met him last, after all the previous meetings and asked for forgiveness and acceptance from her father. It seems that all these women had met Marcello for their own personal benefits and well-being. Even Susanna had similar intentions as she basically wanted her father to leave money for his grandchild in his will. Marcello had indeed been preparing a will, and he was probably all the more confused after this peculiar night. It was Caterina who played an instrumental role and helped her father ease his stress. The young woman had been hiding behind curtains and witnessed all of the meetings and understood how each of the women was trying to make use of Marcello. Taking this realization to her father, she helped the man prepare a unique plan. Marcello wanted to play dead and pretend that he had been murdered and then check how the women reacted to such a situation. This way, he believed, he would be able to understand who all genuinely loved him. He had made the two women he trusted the most at present part of this scheme-his daughter Caterina and his lover Maria. It was these two women who had then set the whole scene, cut off all communications, and also called Veronica onto the scene. At the end it is revealed that there was no murderer at all, for Marcello had not been killed and was very much alive in his room. This was the reason, Caterina explains, that she had locked up the room immediately after the discovery so that the father would not have to play dead for long.Following all the confrontations and reactions that followed among the women after the discovery of the fake murder, Caterina is sure that the five have shown their true colors. Instead of grieving for the loss of the man from their lives, the women got busy with figuring out the murderer and finding out who would get Marcello's property. With all the revelations and these moral evaluations made, it is time for Marcello to step out from his hiding. Caterina opens up his room, and the six others rush in, only to find it empty. The open terrace door makes it clear that the man must have gone there, but more twist follows when the seven women reach the terrace. Marcello seems to have either slipped or jumped off the terrace onto the ground, on which he now lays, motionless and dead. The women now finally inform the police, who arrive on the scene, and they report it as Marcello having committed suicide. Caterina, who does not protest such reporting, is now told by the rest of the women that she should always stick to helping women instead of working against them. She asks whether that should be the case even if a man asks her to work against women, and her mother reassuringly tells her that should indeed be the case.Perhaps Marcello must have slipped and fallen to his death but having to report that to the police would also mean that everything else needed to be said. Instead, the women chose to say that the man had killed himself due to his recent financial struggles and move on with their lives. The patriarch was now dead, and there was no threat to any of the women's lives either. All seven of the women could live together off his wealth and have no conflict among each other, as is suggested by them at the end."

Omar was based out of POK and his main man who conducted the attacks was Bilal who also fled to POK 2 days before the attacks. Omar wants revenge for the atrocities of partition.
Omar has formed a sleeper cell network consisting of 40 terrorists who pose as Indians to set more bombings after the 26/11 Attacks (in 2007), one of whom is his son Riyaz Hafeez (Abhimanyu Singh). Raza Hafeez (Mrunal Jain) is Riyaz's brother.

Shortly after the first training session her thoughts become occupied with the sport - in particular with the consistent form practiced while rowing.Jamie Brill, another freshman largely taking up rowing as a means to attain an athletic scholarship, is quickly labeled as the ""best novice"" on the team to the chagrin of Alex - which further fuels her obsessive drive and compulsive behavior. Over time, Alex improves her rowing times (albeit still behind those of Jamie) at the detriment of her academic performance, and they are both soon moved into the varsity team. While Jamie quickly adapts to the new environment, Alex fails to fit in both socially and athletically - being forced to sit at the back of the bus and accidentally knocking herself out (referred to as ""catching a crab"") during a major race.Moved back to the novice team, Alex loses her already tenuous friendship with Jamie - and during the first joint novice/varsity practice passes out while exercising and urinates herself, becoming the subject of derision within the team. After Erin, a varsity rower and trainer, outlines the criteria to officially make varsity but expresses doubt in Alex due to her small stature. Alex begins vigorously practicing alone, but is interrupted by Coach Pete who has been taking increasing notice of her potentially self-harmful level of commitment. Pete initially attempts to dissuade Alex from working so hard, but eventually offers to assist her in using a scull to practice alone during winter break.Alex steadily improves as a rower by practicing over break, and begins a relationship with her former graduate student instructor Dani. Alex and Jamie are eager to try out for the ""1V boat"" which the best members of the team row on, but are denied the opportunity by Coaches Pete and Edwards. Meanwhile, Alex's health deteriorates, with a wound on her palm frequently bleeding and failing to heal.In the spring, Alex and Jamie race to determine who will take the spot of a 1V Rower who has left the team due to a broken collarbone. Alex loses, sensing that the team was assisting the more popular Jamie by sandbagging while rowing on Alex's boat. Dejected, Alex begins to self-harm, while an infection from the wound on her palm begins to spread throughout her arm. Dani breaks up with Alex due to her increasingly destructive behavior and refusal to change.In the last week of the season, a challenge is set up to beat rower Highsmith's 14 minute record. While intended to be a friendly competition Alex, now fully a pariah within the team, publicly declares her intentions to break the record. The girls set off to row in individual boats on a dark hours of a cold early morning as a thunderstorm sets in. Alex collides her boat into Highsmith's and is thrown into the water, but climbs back on and continues rowing. The rest of the team starts to row back owing to the increasing severity of the storm but Alex persists despite their warnings.Alex finishes the race as a flash of lightning envelops her, and returns to the training building to the silent shock of her team members and coaches, erasing her name from the chalkboard and seemingly quitting the team. It is left ambiguous as to if Alex has beaten Highsmith's record. (thanks to Wikipedia)"

Along the night, Judith has dreadful nightmares and sees a monster attacking Annette, but nobody - including her daughter - believe her and think she has dementia. She befriends also the nurse Liesel that says that she has also noted something supernatural happening in the Manor, but she vanishes. Now Judith decides to investigate the secret of the Manor.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil An old widowed woman, Judith Albright (Barbara Hershey), celebrates her 70th birthday with her daughter and grandkid, Josh. At the party, Judith suffers a stroke, and the doctor diagnoses her with Parkinson's disease. To not become a burden for her family, Judith decides to move into an old-age nursing home, Golden Sun Manor.A fellow nurse, Liesel, attends to Judith and helps her get settled in the new environment. Soon, Judith befriends a trio of old but lively people: Ruth, Trish, and Roland. The group invites Judith to play bridge with them, and they soon establish a sparkling bond.In her room, Judith's roommate, Annette, warns Judith that someone is watching over them. Initially, Judith fails to understand the warning, but later that night, she imagines a monster made up of tree bark lurking inside her room.Everyone at the facility convinces Judith that her visions are probably a sign of dementia. However, Judith refuses to believe that she is crazy and decides to unravel the mystery of the eerie bark monster.One night, Judith saw the bark monster attacking Annette, after which she suddenly died of a stroke. Before dying, Annette told Judith they had been marked and handed over a paper with names written on it.Annette speculated that after her death, the bark monster would kill another patient, Imogen, and then Judith. As soon as the revelations came out, Judith panicked and searched the room. She found a voodoo element hidden under the bed. After that, Judith didn't waste a moment and escaped the facility. On her way out, Judith saw some young teenagers who resembled Ruth, Trish, and Roland. However, at the moment, she failed to understand the uncanny resemblance.Judith contacted her daughter and Josh. However, instead of taking her home, Judith's daughter sent her back to the Manor. At the diner, Judith discovered a wall photograph in which she saw Ruth, Trish, and Roland in one frame. They all looked the same age 40 years ago. Judith tried to inform her daughter and Josh about the dangers, but she believed that Judith had lost touch with reality and was becoming paranoid.Back at the Manor, Judith sneaked inside the director's cabin and investigated further. She found that Roland Benson was a relative of Manor's director, Ms. Benson. Additionally, Ruth Price was related to a male nurse, Gary, and Ruth Cooper was a relative of a nurse named Elizabeth. Judith informed Josh about the link between the patients and the facility. Josh found a Celtic sigil representing an oak tree engraved on Trish's arm from a photograph in the diner. It was the root of all mysteries.Josh figured out that the Celtic sigil imprinted on Trish's arm was an Oak Tree symbol that represented a symbol of longevity and regeneration. Judith connected a few dots and investigated Roland's room, where she found her hairbrush with strands of her hair. Judith believed that Roland, Trish, and Ruth were practicing some kind of black voodoo magic. Thus, she replaced the strands of her hair with Roland's and followed Roland to the woods.Near the larger Oaktree, Judith and Josh witnessed the trio involved in a spiritual ceremony. Roland tried to sacrifice the strands of hair in a pouch to the fire. He demanded the Oak Tree Monster to prey upon the weak (Judith) and gave her energy to them. However, Josh, unaware of the fact that Judith replaced the hair, tried to stop Roland.Roland captured Josh and Judith and revealed that the trio and their relatives run the Manor. They brought old patients to the facility to sacrifice them like sheep. In return for their spiritual sacrifice, the Oak Tree gave them eternal life and youth. Ruth, Trish, and Roland avoided death, but they had to pay the price, and thus these innocent souls were a part of their bargain.Roland, believing he was sacrificing Judith's hair, finished the ceremony. The Oak Monster came out from the branches of the mythical Oaktree and took Roland's life.Judith grabbed a bottle of alcohol and threatened Trish and Ruth to burn the tree to ashes. But the treacherous evils lured Judith into becoming a part of their voodoo magic. Trish and Ruth promised Judith an eternal life and would never have to face the horrors of an old life. She could become young again in the Witcher hour, i.e., from midnight until dawn. Judith saw the trio at their young age when she escaped from the Manor.In the end, Judith was convinced of the Celtic Oak tree's magical power, and she was still confused. Trish and Ruth lured Josh and bought him in by revealing that if they became a part of their sect, Josh would never lose his grandmother, as he had lost his dad. Falling prey to emotions, Josh and Judith became a part of the sect. Soon, a Celtic sigil appeared on Judith and Josh's bodies, and Judith sparkled with youthful energy.The Manor ended as Judith celebrated her 70th birthday again, as she didn't age after becoming a part of Celtic magic. Josh joined the staff to stay close to his grandmother and make her young by sacrificing the innocent old souls who arrived at the Manor. The closing frame depicted a young Judith performing ballet under the magical Oak Tree with a young crowd cheering her graceful performance. Judith wanted to dance again and spend time with the younger generation, and in the end, she achieved it. (thanks to dmtalkies)"

Soon, she has to decide how far she is willing to go to save her son.—yusufpiskin A car is being driven by somebody and it is night time and raining outside. In an restaurant a woman (Laura) is seated having a coffee and two men enters the café and sits in the next table looking at her. She gets up abruptly and leaves in a hurry. (She's pregnant) and the two men follows her. Next we see her driving the car and on the way gives birth to a child while saying, ""I don't want you, I don't want you"".Laura and now-8-year-old David are living a low-key, ordinary and most importantly, happy life. Her neighbor Susan helps them out by keeping David with her while Laura is attending to other matters. But all that changes one night when Laura hears noises coming from David's room and sees a bunch of people standing around his bed. She runs outside screaming for help and bangs on the door of Susan's and ask her to call the police. When she returns home, all the people have vanished from David's room, but David is left in the bed sideways with his shirt off his body.By the time the local cops show up, Detectives Paul (Emile Hirsch) and Steve (Cranston Johnson) cannot find any signs of a break-in. Steve thinks Laura imagined it, chalking it up to sleepwalking or lucid dreaming - but Laura's insistent that there were people in the house trying to kidnap David. Paul's more sympathetic and says they'll look into it. After they leave, she checks David for marks and bruises. She can't find anything and when he wakes up, David says he doesn't remember what happened, except that he was dreaming of drowning in a river of blood.One night, Laura calls Paul to her house when she hears noises outside, but again Paul finds nothing. David gets suddenly, unexplainably sick, puking blood and admitted to hospital. The doctors run every possible test, but can't find anything. They only know he's getting worse by the minute and probably won't make it through the night. Laura suggests that the people she saw in David's room poisoned him, but the doctors say they have tested for poison too and results were negative. Laura keeps the vigil with David and says her heartbreaking goodbyes - but by the next morning, he's made a mysteriously complete recovery.It's not long before David's sickness returns, though. Laura brings him back to the hospital. While there, she reveals to Paul that she was raised in a cult but she escaped 8 years ago and probably it's them who had visited David that day. Later that night, near David's hospital bed, Laura overhears voices outside the room and sees the doctors saying things like, ""The boy is the priority,"" and ""Wait until she's asleep."" Laura looks out the window and sees some shady-looking men getting out of a car, and that's all the motivation she needs to take David and leave. She takes him to the neighbor's while she runs across the street to pack their stuff.Paul calls Laura while she's packing her bags and she asks him to meet her outside the school where she teaches and says not to trust anybody hinting everyone is in on the conspiracy to kidnap David. But when she goes back across the street, she finds her neighbor Susan (Erin Bradley Dangar) dead on the floor - and David making a meal of her major organs, saying he feels better. In a panic, Laura paints ""He Is Coming"" on the wall in Susan's blood - a mantra used by the cult - and leaves town with David, chucking her phone out the window when Paul calls again.She drives to a motel and sleeps while David watches cartoons, giggling like the kid he is. But in the morning, Laura wakes to see she and David are on the news. She switches cars and takes off again, telling David she needs to find an old friend who can help her remember what she's forgotten. Meanwhile, Paul and Steve are at the morgue with the dead neighbor. Steve shows Paul a bunch of old newspaper articles about Laura - whose name used to be Anna - and the pedophile ring she was a victim of. Steve believes Laura killed the neighbor and the whole cult idea is a fantasy used to cover up the severe trauma she suffered.While Laura seeks out a drug addict named Jimmy (Blaine Maye), who grew up in the cult with her, Paul does some investigating on his own and finds the shrink who treated Laura/Anna. She'd been institutionalized after her father was arrested for running the pedophile ring. He says Anna's father used to pimp her out along with Jimmy and confirms that the whole cult idea was a story she constructed in her head.But Jimmy tells a different story. He tells Laura/Anna that the cult used to have ceremonies where they killed animals. Then her father would have her recite this special chant that only she could do - a chant that would summon a demon who would then rape her. Laura doesn't want to believe that, saying it was her father who raped her - but Jimmy insists it was a demon. Then David gets sick again, and Laura takes him to another motel. But things are even worse this time as David becomes increasingly hostile toward her, screaming and ranting in dirty language asking for ""food"".Unable to handle it, Laura runs out to her car and screams her frustration, not knowing what to do. Then she sees the pimp rooming next door beating one of her girls and invites him to her room, and David takes it from there - making a vicious, bloody meal out of the guy. Laura cleans up the mess afterward as David watches cartoons, all better now and happy.Then, they drive to a church where Laura dumps what's left of the pimp and paints another ""He Is Coming"" message. Meanwhile, Paul and Steve show up at Jimmy's house only to find him dead, too, with a bunch of crosses sticking out of his mouth and ""He Is Coming"" cut into his chest.At another motel, David and Laura have this wonderful bonding moment. David says he was dreaming that he was flying and could see her. Then he says the world was in his hands and it cracked in half - there was fire, and everyone was screaming but that he was okay like he was a superhero. ""Nothing could touch me,"" he says. Laura says his sickness is getting worse and more frequent. She says she'll stay with him, but she won't let him kill anyone else.At the pimp crime scene, Steve says it's time to drop the net on Laura, but Paul says they need to go easy on her. David soon gets sick again and when a bunch of guys bust into their darkened room, Laura uses the gun she stole from the pimp and unloads.But when she turns the lights on, it's Steve and two other local cops that she's killed. Later, after she's put some distance between them, Laura calls Paul, who's at the morgue with Steve's body. She says she didn't mean to kill him, and he begs her to turn herself in. But she tells him she's going back where it all started - meaning the house where she lived with her father.When they get to the abandoned house, the banner (from her memory) still flaps in the wind - but instead of ""He Is Coming,"" it says ""Happy Birthday,"" leading us to think Laura might be delusional after all. And when she goes up to the bedroom, it looks the same from her memories - except that there are no cult sigils. Then she goes back out to the car and brings sickly David in, saying that no matter what happens, she loves him and will always take care of him.Laura carries him up to the bedroom and then recites the chant, which she remembers perfectly. She demands that the demon cure David - who she now believes is their son. Laura says she'll kill David if it doesn't. She repeats the chant several more times and an ugly, horned figure rises up behind them, moving slowly toward them.Then, the room shakes and dark smoke billows out of the doorway - but just as the demon touches her, Paul busts in with a bunch of cops. Laura tells him she conjured the demon but that they scared him off. She says the cult fed David flesh to awaken the monster in him, but Paul says she imagined the whole thing. He says he can help her, but she says she can't let David live like this. She loves him too much. And Paul shoots her before she can bring the knife down.Later, in the hospital, Paul sits with David and tells him he'll protect him and make him better. He waits for the nurse to get called away and then cuts off a slice of his arm to feed David. So apparently, Laura was right all along - the cult is very real, and Paul is a part of it. Paul says that no one can know who David really is - and it turns out that Paul killed Jimmy to silence him. Paul tells David he'll never be alone again and that his father's there for him now. And then David rises out of bed and hugs the horned beast, calling it ""Daddy"" and resting his head on its shoulder. (thanks to geekgirlauthority)"

"Batman: The Long Halloween, Part Two",2021,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14402926/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The killer known as Holiday continues to stalk the Falcone crime family while a new class of costumed criminal rises in Gotham City. Batman suspects that a former ally might be the serial killer. The reign of terror wrought by the Holiday killer continues in Gotham City. With each calculated crime, the stakes rise as tensions boil over between the Falcone and Maroni crime families. As Batman, James Gordon and Harvey Dent race to solve the deadly puzzle, a breach at Arkham Asylum brings villainous players into the game. Based on the critically acclaimed graphic novel, Batman: The Long Halloween - Part Two concludes this gripping chapter in the Dark Knight's saga. Poison Ivy has been controlling Bruce Wayne for three months and has been forcing him to sign over assets to Carmine Falcone, while unintentionally preventing him from acting as Batman. Catwoman rescues Bruce (and Alfred) from Poison Ivy. In the meantime, the Holiday killings have continued through Valentine's Day, Saint Patrick's Day, and April Fools' Day.On Mother's Day, Holiday kills the gunmaker that had been supplying his weapons. That night, Scarecrow escapes from Arkham Asylum and ends up in a fight with Batman, and escapes by injecting fear toxin into Batman's abdomen. In a fear-induced hallucination, Batman staggers around Gotham, ending up in Crime Alley, where Catwoman finds him and takes him home. Carmine's daughter, Sofia Falcone, meets with her father after arranging Scarecrow's escape and asks for a seat at his table, which he declines. Dent and Gordon visit Bruce Wayne to get his testimony regarding the night Alberto was killed, with Dent insinuating that there might be a connection between him and the murders, due to the Waynes funding the Falcone Crime Family in the past. Bruce recalls an incident from his childhood where he met Carmine after his father saved his life following a shooting from the Maronis, and claims that this incident might've lead to the death of his parents a year later, insisting that any loyalty between the Waynes died with them.On Father's Day, Maroni meets with his father, Luigi, who is then murdered by Holiday. Following his last advice of making peace with his enemies, Maroni approaches Dent, agreeing to testify against Falcone in exchange for prosecutorial immunity. On the Fourth of July, Harvey and Gilda watch the evening fireworks display on a boardwalk alongside Gordon's family. At the same time, Batman is captured while trying to stop Scarecrow and the Mad Hatter from robbing a bank for the Falcones, but easily escapes his restraints and defeats the two villains. At Carmine's signal, a mob hitman attacks the Dents. Catwoman intervenes but is in turn knocked unconscious by the hitman, who also knocks out Harvey when he gives chase under the boardwalk. When Harvey awakens, he finds the hitman dead, shot by one of holiday's guns, and hears a voice telling him to run before the police arrive.Before Maroni's trial, Batman sneaks into Dent's house, finding paraphernalia associated with the Holiday killer in the basement, along with an Oxford pennant, presenting this evidence to Gordon privately on the courthouse roof. During the trial, Dent is tormented by more messages from the voice, and Maroni, going back on his deal, claims that Carmine is an upstanding citizen. Convinced by the Falcones that Dent is Holiday, Maroni throws a vial of acid in Dent's face to get revenge for his father's death, although he survives with horrible scarring. Waking up bandaged in the hospital, the voice confronts Dent again, and then takes over his body, escaping from the hospital after getting a phone call from Carmine. The call turns out to be a trap to lure Dent out to be assassinated for the Holiday killings, but Dent manages to kill the hitmen before being dragged underwater.At Carmine's birthday party, he celebrates the supposed death of Holiday, only for Holiday to kill his sister, Carla Viti. Batman interrogates Gilda in order to learn more about Dent, still wanting to help him because of their friendship. Dent meets Solomon Grundy in the sewers and enlists the latter's help to attack the people who've wronged him, attacking the police convoy escorting Sal Maroni to prison. Batman, disguised as an officer, defeats Grundy and confronts Dent with Gordon, who has removed his bandages to reveal his scarred face and his new personality. Gordon accuses Dent of being Holiday, revealing the guns found in his basement, shortly before Maroni is shot by Holiday. Dent, seemingly having deduced who Holiday is, attacks both Batman and Gordon to keep them from giving chase to the killer, and then escapes with Grundy. Batman returns to Wayne Manor, which Alfred prepares for another Halloween, and begins to wonder what the point of his mission is if his parents helped create the criminals he fights; however, Alfred assures him that they would be proud. Dent and Grundy then attack Arkham Asylum, freeing numerous inmates, with the exception of Calendar Man. Batman begins to doubt that Dent was connected to the killings, citing the fact that he supposedly went to Oxford and never told anyone, and later asks Catwoman about her obsession with the Falcone family when she saves him from being shot by Carmine. She reveals that Carmine is her father, and she wants to find out her mother's name.Dent and his associates begin to make their move, with Poison Ivy, Scarecrow and Mad Hatter attacking the streets, distracting the police to allow Dent, Joker, Grundy and Penguin to attack Carmine's building. Batman and Catwoman arrive, subduing most of the rogues. However, Harvey manages to shoot Falcone. Falcone's daughter Sofia runs into the room, picks up the pistol, and tries to shoot Harvey, but his gun had only two bullets. She falls out of a window. Catwoman catches Sofia, but Sofia lets go (probably due to the grief of losing so many family members) and falls to her death. When Catwoman unmasks herself, Falcone says the name, ""Louisa."", which is probably Selina's birthmother's name. Later, Batman, Gordon, and Dent meet on the rooftop with the Batsignal. Dent confesses to all of the Holiday murders and surrenders to Gordon.After Harvey is placed in Arkham Asylum, Batman visits Gilda. She tells him that she was the Holiday Killer. She was in a relationship with Alberto Falcone when they were students at Oxford. The Falcone family forced the two to get an annulment and forced Gilda to have an abortion, so she wanted revenge on the Falcone family. Gilda wonders if Batman will arrest her or tell Captain Gordon that she is the Holiday Killer. Batman only wants to know if she's done killing people and leaves without telling her his plans.The movie ends with a scene at Wayne Manor. Bruce wonders why Alfred still bothers to leave candy for trick-or-treaters. Selina walks downstairs and teases Bruce. The doorbell rings. A family of three--two parents and a boy dressed as Batman--have come to partake in the holiday tradition.In the post credits scene, the doorbell rings again. Alfred opens the door and sees The Flash and Green Arrow."

A nervous Rishu (Rani had just yelled at him for not valuing her hotness and not speaking in front of his mom when she yelled at Rani for not being able to cook) fails to consummate the marriage (Afzar was guiding Rishu to be tough with Rani, while Rani's aunt and mom were guiding her to seduce Rishu by revealing her cleavage at every available opportunity in front of him). Lata, meanwhile, starts chiding Rani for lying that she can cook. One day, Rishu overhears Rani speaking to her mother and her aunt that Rishu is not good in bed. Rishu is hurt and retreats into a shell. Rani gets lonely.
One day, Rishu's cousin Neel Tripathi (Harshvardhan Rane) comes to stay with the Saxena's. Neel is dashing and well-built (and he can sense the tension in the house between Rishu and Rani), and Rani gets charmed by him. Neel realizes that Rani is attracted to him, and both begin a fling by sharing a hot passionate kiss. Rani falls in love with Neel to the extent that she begins to learn cooking to feed him his favorite dishes.One day, Neel expresses the desire to have mutton. Rani, who is a vegetarian, agrees and goes out to buy meat. The same day, she tells Neel that she would like to end the marriage and move in. A commitment-phobic Neel panics and runs away. Rani is hurt, and she blurts the truth to Rishu. Rishu wanted to have a fresh start, but this confession hurts him even more. RIshu tracks down Neel and attacks him, but Neel beats up Rishu instead.
The affair had become common knowledge and street goons started teasing Rani, but Rishu stood up for her. Rani was surprised that Neel ran away, but Rishu fought for her.. She decides to turn Rishu around.
A few months later, an explosion takes place in the Saxena residence, killing Rishu. Kishore Rawat, the investigating officer, is sure that Rani had killed Rishu as he thought she helped plan the crime when accidental footage came out that Neel was escaping just before the explosion happened by swimming in a river behind the house.A few months earlier, when Rani blurts the truth to Rishu, his evil side comes out, and he had planned different attempts to hurt Rani (Trips her down the stairs, exploding gas cylinder and so on). However, things are coming out slowly into the positive side when Rani apologizes for her mistake when she tried to attempt suicide. Rishu and Rani run into Neel and when Neel taunts Rani, Rishu tries to run Neel down with his car. Rani realizes the wild side of RIshu for the first time.
On one day, Neel visits Rishu's house when Rishu was not home, and he suddenly returned earlier than expected by Rani. Rishu asked Rani to go outside and told them that he could sort out things with Neel. When Rani came back from the market and feeding the dogs with mutton, an explosion takes place, and she cried for Rishu.
Kishore Rawat failed to accuse Rani of being the murderer when she cleared the Polygraph even though they knew she tried to fool them with a nail in her shoe to make blood pressure rise for relevant questions indicating innocence, not guilty in the investigation, and she leaves the police station happily.It is revealed that when Neel had come to their house that day, he gets in a fight with Rani and threatens to leak her private videos in his WhatsApp groups. Angered by this, Rishu attacks him, and in the ensuing fight, Rani hits Neel's head with a big piece of mutton to save her husband and accidentally kills him. Rishu, not wanting her to go to jail for this, cuts off his own hand and places it there to make it look like his body and runs away from the back exit in Neel's clothes. Rani goes to the market and gets the murder weapon chopped into pieces which she later fed to the street dogs.
After 5 years inspector understands everything about the plan (when he reads the cheap crime novel that Rani kept referring to in her testimony) and how Neel died and he praises the couple's love but he thought that the husband is also dead because he read that book in which that hero dies in the river and the case is already closed but the couple escaping the crime reunite, their love now more vital than ever."

Reza successfully shoots them and leaves the settlement to finish the job but never returns.Ilsa and Remmy spend their days in a panic, waiting for Reza to come back. To their surprise, a strange ranger with a gun appears in their house and takes them hostage.The mysterious ranger who appeared in their house was Jerry (Ismael Cruz Córdova). The house belonged to his parents. Jerry accused Reza and Ilsa of murdering his parents and taking over his place.Ilsa finally confessed that they didn't kill his mother. She was already dead when they arrived at the settlement. They were inhabitants of Earth routed to some other planet, but their transport system broke off, and they had to land on this planet. Jerry's father took them in, but he pulled out a gun on her when he found out about Ilsa's pregnancy and their Earth connection. In self-defense, she slit his throat and started living under the same roof.Speculatively, Jerry killed Reza before he reached the house. He attempts to integrate into the family, demanding thirty days to prove himself to the surviving mother Ilsa and child daughter Remmy. Over time, Ilsa seems to warm to him, but after thirty days, Ilsa tries to shoot him. She fails as the magazine of the gun that Jerry intentionally left was empty, and Jerry kills her in the ensuing struggle. Remmy, who resents Jerry's presence, grows sullen and spends much of her time with ""Steve"", a pet-like robot found in a storage unit. During her visit to the edge of the settlement, Remmy discovered that the area is protected through a transparent glass-kind atmosphere. A metallic chamber was the only way in or out of the glass concave, but she needed an oxygen mask to survive without the suitable atmosphere.Years pass, and Remmy, now a young woman, remains sullen and almost completely silent around Jerry. Jerry convinced Remmy that they have everything available in the settlement. There were other things outside it, but now they were all gone. If she tried to move out, she would be dead in a day or two. But falling prey to her curiosity, Remmy wanted to visit the unexplored lands.Remmy couldn't emotionally afford to live with her parents' murderer. Additionally, Jerry was trying to seduce Remmy so that he could keep his race going with newborns. Initially, he started a relationship with Ilsa, but Remmy was his only option to carry on the lineage after she was gone. Jerry thought he had a responsibility to continue his race, but Remmy didn't want to take part in it. It became an apparent conflict between the two.Jerry burnt all oxygen masks so that no one dared to leave the settlement. But Remmy hid one in a trunk under her bed. When Jerry found out, he ties her to a bed and try to assault and rape her, but Remmy's precious robot Steve, blasts Jerry in the neck with its power-drilling attachment. Remmy frees herself and shoots Jerry with a gun and kills him for good.Through her expertise, Remmy rebuilds the Robot and makes an oxygen mask for herself. She hands over the settlement to the Robot and leaves. With the help of the underground chamber, Remmy walks to the other side of the atmosphere to explore new lands and meet new people if she survived the odds. (thanks to dmtalkies)"

Below Zero,2021,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9845564/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"On a lonely road, a prison transport is brutally assaulted. Martin, the policeman who was driving, survives and fortifies his position while the con men search for a way to finish him. In the opening scene, an injured man named Chino struggles to escape through a wood at night, but is soon caught by his pursuer. When the victim is unable to tell his attacker the location of a missing woman, the attacker buries him alive.The action moves to a police station, where police officer Martín (Javier Gutiérrez) is starting a new job. One of his first duties is to drive a prisoner transport vehicle at night. He will be partnered with Officer Montesino (Isak Férriz) during the transfer of six prisoners. During the strip search of the prisoners prior to departure, Montesino displays an aggressive attitude, deliberately humiliating some of the men. Martín, who believes in obeying the rules, prevents Montesino from striking one of the prisoners.
The prison transport vehicle is escorted by a police car with two officers, driving ahead. When the transport vehicle enters a foggy patch on the road, Martín loses sight of the police car, as well as radio contact. Then the truck is brought to a sudden stop by a spiked strip lying across the road. Montesino goes outside to assess the situation, but then Martín also loses radio contact with him.Martín gets out himself to investigate and finds Montesino unconscious and bleeding. Someone then starts shooting at him from the trees. Running for cover, Martín finds the overturned police car with both officers shot dead.
Martín returns fire at the sniper, emptying his gun. He makes it back to the transport vehicle, but is shot in the leg. In the cabin of the truck, he tries to call headquarters, but when the sniper shoots at the windscreen he retreats into the prisoners' section.One of the prisoners had earlier managed to access a hidden lock pick, and used it to remove his handcuffs and open his cell. He tries to overpower Martín, but the officer holds him off with his gun. Then gasoline is poured into two of the cells (from tubes through the ventilation grilles) and set alight. Martín has to open the cells to save the prisoners, although one man, Pardo (Miquel Gelabert), has already died.
The freed prisoners open the other cells and Martín is surrounded. He still tries to hold them off with his weapon, but then a message comes through the radio, announcing to the prisoners that Martín's gun is, in fact, empty, and that they should take his key and escape. All, that is, except a young prisoner called Nano (Patrick Criado), who is wanted by the man who has staged the hijack. Nano responds to this by beating to death another prisoner, Mihai (Florin Opritescu), a foreigner, whom Nano insists has masterminded the whole thing, and that it is nothing to do with him. Nano has also managed to get hold of Martín's key.The hijacker, Miguel (Karra Elejalde), who has entered the truck's cabin, sends another radio message, telling the men that if they do not hand over Nano they will all die. A brawl ensues, with the men trying to get the key off Nano, but he swallows it. Martín is overpowered and knocked unconscious by prisoner Ramis (Luis Callejo). When he comes to, he is locked in an area at one end of the truck, along with Nano, while the other men try to figure out a way to open the exit door. Ramis asks Martín if he remembers him? Apparently he performed in a band at Martín's wedding.Miguel starts the truck and begins to drive. In the back, the heating has been turned off and as it is winter the men are freezing. One of the prisoners, Rei (Édgar Vittorino), enters a storage compartment under the truck and tries to unscrew a panel.
However, Montesino, whom Martín had believed to be dead, has begun to revive. Although wounded, he finds Miguel's jeep hidden in the trees. In the glove box is a gun, and also numerous photos of a young woman. Newspaper cuttings reveal her to be Miguel's missing daughter, Soledad ""Sole"" García.Montesino transmits a distress call to headquarters and then drives after the prisoner transport truck. When he catches up with it, he fires through the side window of the cab, but Miguel manages to drive him off the road. Montesino hits a tree, and dies from his injuries. Meanwhile, Rei has also died, having been impaled on a long metal screw in the storage compartment, while the truck was swerving about.
Inside the truck, Martín talks with Nano, trying to discover what this is all about. Nano insists he does not know. Miguel had mentioned the name Chino (Àlex Monner) in one of his radio messages, and Nano says that this is someone he grew up with, and who is like a brother to him.Miguel continues to drive as dawn breaks over the snowy landscape. He drives the truck into the middle of a frozen lake and shoots at the surrounding ice so that the vehicle begins to sink. Then he walks off. As freezing water begins to fill the truck, Martín tells Ramis to release him so that he can reveal an emergency exit. Martín, Nano and Ramis escape through this exit, but the remaining prisoner, Gollum (Andrés Gertrúdix), succumbs to the cold and dies.Nano runs off after climbing out of the lake. Ramis and Martín shake hands before they part; Ramis wants to pursue his dream of opening a bar in the Caribbean. Martín makes his way to a nearby village, where he hears gunfire. Miguel is stationed in a high building, firing at Nano, who is hiding in the street below.
Martín creeps up behind Miguel, but is held off by Miguel's shotgun. Miguel explains why he is doing this; he had allowed his 13 year old daughter Sole to visit a fair with her friend. Nano and his friend Chino separated Sole from her girlfriend, and persuaded her to drink some shots. Unused to alcohol, she was soon drunk and then the boys took turns raping her. They then tortured her, with cigarette butts, pliers and a bottle. Finally they tied her to a car and dragged her through the fields until she died.Nano, already a hardened criminal, with numerous jail sentences behind him, was suspected of the crime, but the police could not prove anything. However, Miguel tracked down Chino, who confessed under torture to what they had done - only he did not know where Nano had hidden Sole's body (it was Chino who was buried alive in the opening scene). All Miguel now wants is to retrieve his daughter's body so that he can give her a proper burial.
Martín says he cannot permit Miguel to kill Nano. Miguel says he understands, as he was once a police officer. The men grapple for the shotgun and Martín overpowers Miguel and takes the weapon, but Miguel runs off in pursuit of Nano.Martín follows and finds Miguel beating Nano. Martín makes him back off, whereupon Nano sneers at Miguel, saying he will never reveal the location of his daughter's body. Hearing this, Martín shoots Nano in the foot, and then blasts his hand off, demanding he tell Miguel where Sole is. In agony, Nano finally confesses that she is buried in a well on a farm. As he makes this revelation, a police rescue helicopter arrives.
In a final scene, Martín clears out his locker at headquarters and leaves the building, presumably having also left his police career behind him."

While on the road with his boys, Malik passes a police car and tells his boys to get down. Hours later, Malik is pulled over by a different cop.

He is a public defender and as he says in the narration of the first scene, there aren't enough people doing his job, and people who need help aren't getting enough of it.Twelve days before the collapse, Casi's first defendant in the movie is Ah-Chut, who does not speak English. There is no translator available. Getting him out of jail means appearing before the strict Judge Cymberline. He is not successful.Craig goes to the Tow Pound, telling Lea he is there to get a friend's car out. She can't help him. He offers her a lot of money and then flirts, but ultimately he is not successful. The car is a Lincoln Navigator which will be auctioned.The power goes out in much of the city. Casi needs a place to stay and visits Angus, who believes in conspiracy theories and has complicated equations on his blackboard. In a later visit, Angus explains the concept of a singularity in a black hole.Lea gets out of bed to find Craig using her computer. She throws him out.Ten days before the collapse, Casi hears two assistant DAs laughing about a Chinese prisoner. He demands to know more but they just laugh and get on the elevator.

At the prestigious Fairfield Academy, an elite boarding school for girls, six friends jokingly engage in a late night ritual, calling forth the spirit of a dead former student who reportedly haunts their halls. Before morning, one of the girls is dead, leaving the others wondering what they may have awakened. Boredom leads the schoolgirls to a prank gone wrong. A fake seance to summon the Edelvine Ghost, which scares its target, Kerrie, so much that she takes her own life. That situation plays well for Camille Meadows ( Suki Waterhouse) who takes Kerrie's space at the boarding school. Soon other schoolgirls are dropping dead. Is it a ghost or a serial killer or multiple serial killers or none of the above?—Frank Liesenborgs One night at the Edelvine Academy for Girls, a clique of girls led by ruthless popular girl Alice, play a prank on their classmate Kerrie by faking a haunting by the Edelvine Ghost, an urban legend involving a student who killed herself. Upset, Kerrie goes back to her dorm room where she glimpses a figure watching her. When the girls hear her screams and rush into her room, they discover Kerrie dead, having fallen out of her dorm room window.
New student Camille Meadows takes Kerrie's place at the academy. She meets headmistress Mrs. Landry and her son Trevor who works as a handyman. Student Helina shows Camille to her room which happens to be Kerrie's old room. Camille notices strange supernatural occurrences in the dorm room.

Mrs. Landry sentences the girls to spend detention in the library. Alice convinces Camille and Helina to join her and the others in a seance to contact Kerrie. Although Camille and Helina expect another prank, the group is stunned when they actually make contact with a spirit that warns them that they will be murdered. The group wonder if they communicated with Kerrie or the Edelvine Ghost. Later that night, Lenora is attacked and killed by an unseen assailant.
The next day, Mrs. Landry questions the girls on Lenora's unusual disappearance and informs them her personal items are missing, suspecting she has run away. The group investigates her room with Trevor's help and discovers a strange cross drawn in blood on Lenora's bed. Camille later identifies the cross as a symbol on a pendant worn by Alicia Kane, the deceased student who supposedly became the Edelvine Ghost. Later that night, Rosalind is killed in the shower, her body being discovered by Camille. The death is presumed an accident. Unsettled, Camille visits Helina and they discuss the possibility of ghosts. Bethany spots a masked figure in her room which disappears when she screams for help. Bethany claims it is the Edelvine Ghost but Mrs. Landry dismisses it as a bad dream while Camille is also unconvinced it was a ghost as Bethany was able to scare it away.
Camille, Helina, Alice, Bethany, and Yvonne meet for another seance to contact Rosalind and ask her what happened. Rosalind's spirit states she was murdered and identifies Camille as the killer. Alice attacks Camille while the others grow suspicious of Camille. While practicing for her dance recital, Yvonne is murdered by the masked figure Bethany saw. After another haunting from Kerrie, Camille moves in with Helina, and the two comfort each other over recent events. Alice receives a text from Yvonne asking her to go outside, where she discovers Lenora's corpse before being knocked out by the masked assailant. Camille tries to follow Alice but is knocked unconscious by another masked assailant.
Camille awakens restrained in the library next to an unconscious Alice.

Bethany also reveals she faked the communication with the spirits at the seances and that Trevor murdered Alicia Kane who was his babysitter and faked her suicide. Bethany states her plan to murder Alice, frame Camille for the murders, and then tie up any loose ends by killing Helina in a faked suicide. Camille reveals that she isn't really Camille, having assumed Camille Meadows's identity in order to avenge her friend Kerrie. The power goes out, causing Bethany to leave and fix it. As Trevor threatens Camille, Helina knocks him unconscious and frees Camille and Alice, having been lead to the library by Kerrie's ghost.
The trio attempts to escape but the power comes back on and Bethany ambushes them. Camille fends Bethany off and stabs her in the neck with a light bulb, killing her. Alice and Helina escape the library as Trevor reawakens. Camille manages to decapitate him with a bookshelf.

He tries to apply for a visa but fails to get one, and thus tries to go illegally.After listening to Jaggi's story, Gautam admits that his philosophy was just a reception speech. Ira and Gautam are currently separated as Gautam had exposed to the government that a young boy selling food on the street was a refugee staying illegally. Ira, who felt sympathy for the boy, argued with Gautam over this and left him.Jaggi has to be deported to India. He tries to escape, but gets caught when he suffers injuries while saving his fellow traveler Bilal. Due to some problem in documentation, Jaggi's flight is missed. Gautam has to keep Jaggi with him for 2 days till the next flight on Monday morning. On the way back home, Jaggi sees the other side of the English Channel and asks Gautam what lies on the other side. Listening to Gautam's reply, Jaggi gets excited and laughs that he can swim and cross the sea. Both spend some time enjoying, and on the way, Jaggi sees a dress and wishes to buy it for Kartika. For the first time in 3 months, ultimately, he finally calls Kartika to enquire about her dress size. She is shocked to hear Jaggi's voice. He says that he is in France and will try to reach there before Monday. She doesn't believe him and thinks he is joking, but her phone battery drains out before they can speak further. The next day, Jaggi persuades Gautam to make a step to his relationship and calls Ira, who wishes to talk it out. At the restaurant, Ira instead asks for divorce and tells Gautam to sign the papers. He angrily signs the papers and leaves. On the way home, Jaggi sees a swimsuit and desires to swim the English Channel wearing that swimsuit. Angry, Gautam takes Jaggi to a swimming pool and makes him swim continuously, believing that as the English Channel is 20 miles long it would be nearly suicidal to cover the entire length by swimming.The next day, Gautam is surprised to find Ira at his doorstep, and realizes that Jaggi, who has gone missing, is responsible for having made the call to her. Jaggi leaves behind a letter, stating that he will try to reunite with Kartika, no matter what. He then enters the sea in order to reach the other side of the United Kingdom. Here, Gautam and Ira try to find him out but they fail. Kartika is also concerned for him because Jaggi called her from a P.C.O. and claimed that he is coming for her through the channel.Jaggi swims long as he can go, but starts losing energy by the middle of the sea, and faints. He is saved by some strangers. Gautam informs Kartika that Jaggi is safe and that he tried to cross English Channel in order to reach her. He asks her if she would have really broken off her marriage in the event that Jaggi would have crossed the sea, but she is confused and doesn't have an answer. Seeing Jaggi's intense love for her, she falls in love with him. She confesses her feelings to Jaggi on phone and demands that he pick her up fast.Seeing the love between the two, Gautam helps Jaggi get a passport with a United Kingdom visa illegally. When Ira asks Gautam why he is risking his career for Jaggi, he admits that he felt guilty since Jaggi was willing to go to unimaginable lengths to reunite with his love but he himself wasn't. For the last time, Jaggi goes to meet Bilal and tells him everything.At the last moment when Gautam and Jaggi are about to board the plane, Bilal betrays Jaggi to the cops in return for a job, a house and legal citizenship. Seeing the police in search of him, Jaggi hides at the bottom of the plane.At the end, it is shown that Gautam and Ira reunited back and Gautam was telling Jaggi's love story to his friends as they were remembering him, as he concludes saying that everyone has a story of love, and the only common factor binding them is the intensity of that love."

In the background train horn can be heard, as it seems that she has evaded her killer, the killer appears and strikes her dead.
Quick cut to a woman (later identified as Mira, played by Chopra) us standing at High Road Station about to board a train. She is injured and intoxicated.
The film shifts to 2017, a backstory develops on how Mira met Shekhar (Avinash Tiwary) in a friend's wedding. The song montage follows on how they fell in love and got married and moved to a house.
The story moves forward to 2019, Mira while on a shopping spree notices a black car following her, she manages to escape and reach home scared only to have the perpetrator/stalker throw a rock with a message. She shows Shekhar the threat note that asked her to drop the case against some big guy Bagga or her life would be in danger.
Shekhar requests her to not fight the case for the sake for their family that could soon be expanding as Mira is potentially pregnant.
Mira against the advises of Shekhar ends up fighting the case and imprisoning Bagga and freeing a innocent man. She is being thanked by the man's parents when Shekhar informs her that the results were positive and they are soon going to have a baby.
Quick cut to 7 months later a pregnant Mira is the car with Shekhar returning from a movie, she mentions how she plans to quit her job as a lawyer as it was her dream to have a baby. At this moment a car coming from right crashes into Shekhar's side badly injuring both.Cut to a week we see Mira consulting a doctor who informs her about her suffering from amnesia where her short term memory never gets converted into long term and thus she suffers from episodes of total blackout. Mira contemplates on how she doesn't has anything in her life to remember as after the accident she miscarried. To cope up the pain she started heavily drinking, she became so relied on alcohol that it eventually broke her marriage with Shekhar moving on and marrying Anjali.
Mira rides the train every day being unemployed with the sole purpose of seeing Shekhar and Anjali in the home she used to once live in. While seeing her house every day from the train window she also comes across the happiest moment of her day where near Greenwich station stays a woman (same as the one from the start of movie, named Nusrat, played by Hydari).
Mira is strangely drawn to this woman and her perfect life filled with happiness and love. Mira always sees this girl as the one she was before the accident. She sees her everyday and even though doesn't even knows her name she feels as though she knows this woman closely. We see Mira trying to get a new job but she fails when her PTSD strikes on being asked why she hadn't worked in past tear. She leaves the interview, buys vodka, and boards the train. She again sees Nusrat dancing in her room and contemplates on how happy and perfect her life is. She then meets her friend Priya (from the wedding) in a bar. They often meet and Priya helps Mira to come out of her obsession over Shekhar and they drink shots to make Mira forget about Shekhar whose Facebook update is a picture with his new wife. In a parallel scene we get to know that Shekhar and Anjali are troubled by Mira constantly calling Shekhar, he pacifies his wife as its her birthday and they end up taking a pic that Mira sees on Facebook.In present day we see officer Kunal getting report of a Nusrat John being missing from 2 days. Case is handed Officer Kaur(played by Kulhari) and she starts the investigation by questioning the people at the hospital Nusrat worked in as a nurse. Nusrat's colleagues were the ones filing the report and they mention how she had gone to her dance instructor's party with them only for them to lose track of her eventually. The police questions the dance instructor Rajiv who mentions that he dated Nusrat casually and hadn't met her that day. On questioning her dance mates, Officer Kaur gets to know about Dr Hamid proceed the psychiatrist that Nusrat used to go frequently to. On questioning him and watching the recording of his sessions with Nusrat, it's known that Nusrat was in an unhappy relationship, where her husband used to be abusive towards her. Also her dance instructor was never dating her. He also mentions on how one day after her dance session he had seen a unknown guy demanding money from Nusrat or he would have shown something to her husband Anand. When asked about it by Dr Hamid, Nusrat had replied that he was just an old friend. On questioning Anand on why he wasn't the one filing the missing report for his wife and seemed rather unaffected by the whole situation, Anand replies that they were heading to divorce because Nusrat was apparently cheating on him.The police then seem to have found a lead apparently in the dance studio basement where the mask wore by Nusrat and drops of blood are found. Cctv footage suggests that its Rajiv who forced himself onto Nusrat but its later found out its a different girl altogether and Nusrat had left the party almost immediately.In meantime we see Mira on the train the day Nusrat went missing. Mira narrates on how she felt something unusual about Nusrat that day, how she seemed upset. At this moment she sees a man embracing Nusrat, Mira is shocked to see that the man is not her husband and suspects that Nusrat is cheating. Before she can find out more the train moves and she loses the sight. Mira meets Priya and is constantly asking answers for why was Nusrat cheating. Mira and Priya end up taking a few more shots that enrages Mira more. The fact that Nusrat is cheating resonates with Mira as Shekhar had cheated on her with Anjali that ended up destroying her. In a drunken rage she opens her phone to record a video of her abusing Shekhar, but Priya stops her. While the video still recording we see Mira completely crashing down and explain how betrayed she feels by Nusrat's actions and how she wants to go to Nusrat's house grab her hair and smash her head in the table till she dies. Once alone and still unable to cope Mira reaches Nusrat's home. She rings the bell but no one answers then she notices Nusrat walking towards the pathway on the side of the house that led to the forest behind. We see her following Nusrat noticing same guy who blackmailed Nusrat clicking pics of Nusrat. She catches up to her then blacks out to return to high road station injured. She gets on the train and is completely intoxicated barely conscious only thing she sees outside the window are firecrackers bursting.Back in present day police have found Nusrat's body in the forest, with preliminary reports it seems her body was dragged to the spot where it was dumped. Cctv footage shows an intoxicated angry Mira. After Anand denied knowing her the police suspect that Mira might have murdered Nusrat as her citizen card is found nearby the body. The police trace her steps to Mira getting down at Greewich station at 6, to barge at Nusrat's door at 6.30. Then next she is seen at High Road station injured at 10.30.
Having a previous history of alcohol abuse she becomes the prime suspect.Present day Mira wakes injured and heavily intoxicated at her home. She tries to recall but to no avail. She finds a message on her phone with unknown number saying that she was in the forest and Nusrat is dead. She then finds a video of her that she accidentally recorded explaining how she wants to kill Nusrat. Scared she attends her support group/class where she explains on how after miscarriage she started using alcohol to heal herself, and how she became so dependent on it that she often became violent and forgot about it. She mentions on how celebrating Shekhar's promotion at home she has a drink too many and wakes in the morning only to Shekhar tell her how she hurled him with a corkscrew when he asked to stop drinking. Over multiple such stories she mentions how she got drunk at Shekhar's colleagues party and abused the host that caused Shekhar to get fired, and how on being asked to sign divorce papers she becomes enraged and breaks the mirror to no recollection. She is scared something similar had happened that day with Nusrat and she might have hurt her in her drunken state. She concludes that she has to remember that one night as that could be the only way out.
Post her session she meets Priya and before she can tell Priya anything, Kaur and Kunal show up asking her questions about that night. She lies that she doesn't recognize Nusrat, lies about her citizen card being stolen and lies about remembering anything about the night. This makes Kaur call her compulsive liar.
Since they don't have evidence they can't arrest her, they leave Mira who rushes to her doctor only to profess that she might have murdered Nusrat in drunken rage. Mira also contacts Anand, only to know the guy she saw Nusrat with was her psychiatrist, to this Anand admits that he wanted to Mira because he had hired a PI to follow Nusrat and he wanted to know how will police react to it. Mira comes back home only to be troubled by how angry she was in the video, and thus she ends up contacting the unknown number to know what happened that night. She receives a call from someone saying for a price she can know what happened in the forest. She agrees.
Before the unknown caller contacts back we see Kaur coming down to force her to plead guilty. Kaur explains that all evidence are against her and being a lawyer herself she should confess instead of trying to delaying investigation by bringing up the the psychiatrist. In meantime Kaur gets a call that explains that at time of death Nusrat was pregnant and also that Mira's blood was found nearby. Mira is to be arrested immediately but she requests to bring her medication from the washroom. Once inside Mira panics only to jump from her bathroom window. As the police barge inside the bathroom, Mira is seen escaping unharmed by the fall as she landed on a pile of garbage bags.
She runs and evades the police only to notice she had dropped her phone that got picked by Kaur.
Now on the run, to prove her innocence she meets the guy she saved from trial in start of the movie. She requests him some money, phone and a gun. She uses the gun to threaten Dr Hamid. He explains that Nusrat had called him over because she got to know the same day that she was pregnant but the baby wasn't Anands. He didn't know whose it was but she was texting him and was supposed to meet him that evening to sort it out. To find more clues about this new person who could have potentially murdered Nusrat she sets to the forest. There at the edge of the forest she finds a horse ranch whose owner denies seeing her or Nusrat ever.
Back at police station they find from Mira's phone that someone was extorting her for money. Kaur asks the data to be backed up and the phone be returned to her.
Mira is the station where she is unable to use her pass as its out of balance. When she goes to gets it recharged the technician mentions that her last trip was from High Road to Redford at 8.30 pm. She doubles checks with him before leaving. Meanwhile police know that she has been spotted at the train station and start searching for her. Mira in low profile attends the prayer service for Nusrat, where she notices an altar with her pictures, there she sees a picture of Nusrat's phone and recalls the ranch boy having the same phone. She retrieves Nusrat's phone and sim from the ranch boy. While exiting the station she comes across Shekhar's ex boss Zahra and her husband, she apologizes to them for her behavior. They seem have to no recollection of it, on insistence they tell her that that day at party she felt puckish so she napped in their study, while towards the end of the party She noticed how violent and aggression Shekhar got on Mira. On asked about Shekhar being fired, they tell Mira it had nothing to do with her but because of Shekhar's inappropriate behavior towards a female coworker. Zahra concludes that she was glad when she got to know about the divorce. This comes as a realization to Mira on how all her episodes of rage were tales fed to her by Shekhar and how Shekhar created scenarios, forced her to drink, injured himself or her and made her think that it's her fault.
Shaken to the core by this revelation Mira stops consuming alcohol.
In meantime she gets Nusrat's phone to work only to find that she was having an affair with Shekhar. She goes to High Road station to confirm her doubts and Cctv confirms her presence at the station 8.30 not 10.30. She asks about who provided the tape to the police and gives the technician money to keep her posted on the same. She contacts the PI hired by Anand, he turns out to be the person who was blackmailing Nusrat regarding sending her pics with Shekhar to Anand. He was also present that day in forest and was the one to ask Mira for money. Mira is about to meet the PI Walter when suddenly a car comes at hits him killing him. Before he dies he mumbles something about his house to Mira. Mira grabs Walter's phone and threatens Anand to give her Walter's home address or she will tell the police about him spying on his now late wife. Mira texts someone from Walter's phone saying that proof is at his house.
Once at Walter's house she sees all the prints of her and Shekhar and Nusrat in the forest. She calls Shekhar from Nusrat's phone only to have Anjali picking up and abusing Mira for calling. Once Shekhar comes on phone Mira connects on how all this while he had saved Nusrat's number under her name. She tells him to meet her at Walter's home, as she knew about him being the father.
Shekhar comes and tries to play dumb. To this Mira threatens him with the gun, he finally accepts that he had an affair with Nusrat, they worked at same hospital. They always met in the forest. It was same that day too but Mira came there and confronted Nusrat. Nusrat escaped and ran to him. This made him angry and he hit Mira multiple times finally pushing her on a rock that injured her and made her bleed. Once unconscious he returned to Nusrat. When she told him about her pregnancy and refused to get the baby aborted Shekhar in rage strangled her. She was threatening to get him arrested on the grounds of sexual exploitation.
Concluding the story he offers Mira vodka planning to manipulate her again, this time Mira doesn't fall foe his trap, he requests her to give him Nusrat's phone she agrees only to hit him and knock him unconscious.
Then as a major plot twist it turns out Shekhar hadn't actually murdered Nusrat, as he didn't have a motive to murder Walter. In flashback Mira is seen rummaging through photographs that Walter took only to remember that the car that hit him was same car she had seen before too. On running the license plate it turns out the car belonged to Jimmy Bhalla the culprit of her last court case. He had committed suicide in prison and while searching his images she gets to know that Kaur is his daughter. It was at this moment that Kaur comes in with a gun in her hand. Explanation ensues and Kaur tells that her father was wrongly accused by Mira because of which he died. And post his death she took upon herself to avenge and spoil Mira's life. She was the one who threatened her, crashed her car in the accident. And when she saw one day travelling in train she started shadowing her. That day she was at the forest too, and wanted to murder an unconscious Mira but unfortunately Shekhar hadn't murdered Nusrat, he had barely suffocated her to unconsciousness but panicked about it and had left
While Kaur was trying to murder Mira, Nusrat gained consciousness and saw her in the act. So while Kaur pursued and killed Nusrat, Mira gained consciousness, walked to the nearest station and took the train only to notice Nusrat being chased through the forest. This was her plan to frame Mira.
But Mira concludes saying that she couldn't be framed as she already knew Kaur's role in this as she had received proof from high road station CCTV tech that it was Kauai who bungled the footage timing, and she knew that Kauai had her phone so she intentionally sent the text to her phone from Walter's phone after his death. A fight ensues between them that ends up in Kaur accidentally shooting herself.
Back to present Mira takes Kaur's gun and places it in an unconscious Shekhar's hand to make it look like he murdered her. Police arrests Shekhar and Anjali breaks up with him.The movie ends with Mira paying respect to Nusrat's grave and the taking a new train to a new journey."

But one evening, Tania is found half-dead on the beach after going to a nightclub; she had been raped and beaten. Klara resolves to do everything to find the attackers and avenge their crime against her sister. Her merciless hunt leads her to Yvan Kadnikov, the son of a powerful Russian oligarch of the French Riviera. Klara serves in Syria in the French Army as an interpreter for Opération Chammal. After the apprehension of a suspected terrorist, she witnesses the man's young son blow himself up at his father's behest with explosives hidden on his body. Traumatized by the blast and experiencing migraine headaches from it, she is transferred home to Nice and moves back in with her mother, Maria, and her sister, Tania, while serving in counter-terrorist operations as part of Opération Sentinelle. On patrol, her trauma manifests itself in impulsive, sometimes disproportionally violent behavior towards suspects. The painkillers she was prescribed are not enough for her and she begins to buy more illegally.One night, Klara and Tania go out to a nightclub. Tania separates from Klara to join a party of Russians and signals to Klara that she is leaving with them.

The next day she is notified that Tania had been raped and savagely beaten into a coma. Klara starts her own investigation of the crime, inspects the club's security footage, finds out the name of the man Tania was with, and takes a photograph of him in the footage. Captain Muller of the French Police, who is leading the investigation, identifies the suspect as Yvan Kadnikov, the son of Leonid Kadnikov who is an influential and well-connected Russian tycoon.

While outside her sister's hospital room, Klara sees a news report in which Leonid states that he will be returning to Russia soon. She notices a nurse rushing past her and right afterwards Tania has a sudden embolism. Suspecting an attempt on her sister's life, Klara pursues and catches and beats up the female assassin. Captain Muller informs Klara that she had been sent by Leonid.Now fully bent on revenge, Klara steals several weapons from her garrison's armory and sneaks into Leonid's hideout. After killing the bodyguards, she pushes Leonid off a bannister when he tries to bribe her, and when she observes his body assumes he's been killed. Klara is stabbed by Yvan and shoots him dead.

He is killed when it detonates.Exhausted and distraught, Darren tells Arianne that this expedition was not to map out the geographical area as he had led her to believe. He is being paid by a coal mining company that wants the rare mineral in the caves. He refuses to go on and Arianne leaves, promising to bring help back. She reaches the surface, but is surprised and captured by one of the creatures, which knocks her out with a paralytic venom. She awakens briefly to see that she is on a raft being steered by one of the creatures, along with Shelby's corpse. When they reach the creatures' lair, she is reunited with Darren and Shawn, both of whom have also been captured. Shawn notes that the creatures are a species which breeds and colonizes like ants or bees. He is then fed to the queen creature, which is a bloated, immobile hulk. The creatures attempt to feed Arianne to the queen, but she recovers from the venom and uses a grenade Darren gave her to kill the queen.She and Darren escape and begin to climb up a rope at the entrance, but one of the creatures follows them and attacks Darren. Arianne gives him a knife to fight back, but the creature manages to poison him. He chooses to cut the rope instead, saving Arianne at the cost of his own life. The locals arrive, and one of them is about to cut the rope and doom Arianne, only for Schuttman to stop him and help her escape. The locals use a flamethrower and rifles to drive the creatures back into the tunnels. Afterwards Schuttmann is driving Arianne back to the outside of the fence. He tells her about the death of his son and asks her to help them keep the creatures from escaping. While she's unsure that they can overcome the monsters, she reluctantly agrees to help.

Arjun Pathak once a prime time news anchor for TRTV go demoted from his position due to unacceptable reasons and now works as an RJ for the same channel for current affairs.Arjun while of air gets a call from Raghubir Matha stating that he will blow the sea link but he takes it as a joke and asks him to go ahead and next moment the sea link is blown killing innocent lives.Arjun does not report about Raghubir to the cops but keeps a demand in front of his boss Ankita Malaskar that he will have to be given his prime time seat back if she wants to air the prime news on her channel.Ankita whose more concerned about her channel ratings strikes deal but Arjun will have to show the news what she wants.Arjun covers the news where Raghubir demands that the Chief Minister should come to his studio and say sorry to him during his live telecast or else there will be more destruction. But Ankita's only priority is to check her TRP ratings where Raghubir causes more destruction where Arjun looses his wife Saumya as well as causes trouble for himself.—alex.mjacko@gmail.com Arjun Pathak (Kartik Aaryan) was once a top news anchor, but gets demoted due to an unsavory incident. Pulled from prime-time TV news and recently divorced, he is now the jaded and bitter host of a current affairs radio program. One day during his morning show, Arjun receives a peculiar phone call threatening to blow up the Bandra-Worli Sea Link, a major bridge which is also just outside Arjun's studio building. At first, Arjun takes it as a joke or prank call and tells the terrorist to proceed. He watches in shock as the caller follows through on the threat and detonates explosives that cause the bridge to collapse, killing innocent people and trapping others.Realising this could be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to make his comeback as a newscaster, Arjun purposely doesn't call the police (& also stops the radio show employees from calling the police). Instead, he sets up a makeshift television studio from his radio station, and negotiates with his former boss (he records the call and gets Ankita to promise the prime anchor slot to Arjun), the profit- and ratings-obsessed news producer, Ankita Malaskar (Amruta Subhash) who'll do anything to beat the other TV stations in their coverage of the bombing. Then Arjun strikes a dangerous deal with the terrorist to exclusively broadcast their phone conversations live (Arjun agrees to pay Rs 2179245 in exchange for exclusivity), in real-time, as the whole nation watches.The newsroom erupts in chaos as Arjun, Ankita, the police, other broadcast providers and the government all exploit terrorism for their own agenda. The only exception is Soumya (Mrunal Thakur), Arjun's ex-wife, a reporter who volunteers to report from the site of the terrorist attack. Arjun is not happy that Ankita sent Soumya to the site for reporting.
As the live show progresses, Arjun gradually realizes how little control he has over the situation. The terrorist, who claims to be Raghubeer Mhata (Soham Majumdar), a 50-something construction worker who lost three of his co-workers in a senseless industrial accident while fixing the bridge (Raghubeer says he worked on the construction of the bridge in 2000 and then was brought in to conduct repairs before a big industrial summit in the city. The crew was made to work at night, in heavy rain for an extra bonus of Rs 1000. A rope broke and 3 men fell into the water. Nobody rescued them as everyone was busy prepping to welcome the VIPs), says the families of the victims weren't compensated and demands a public apology from the minister Jeydev Patil (who was in charge of the repairs) for the deaths of his colleagues. With several people remaining on the bridge as hostages, the terrorist threatens a second explosion. He also reveals to Arjun alone that he put a bomb in the anchor's earphone, and that if the minister doesn't apologize, the bomb will explode in his ear, live on air.Arjun promises to the caller that he will request the minister to come to their studio and give him an apology. Anti terrorism Officer Praveen Kamath (Vikas Kumar) arrives at the studio and guides Arjun through the negotiations. Raghubeer had given a 10 mins warning to produce the minister. At the end of 10 mins, Praveen asks Arjun to tell Raghubeer that the Minister is coming in 5 mins.
The minister's deputy Subhash Mathur (Vishwajeet Pradhan) arrives at the studio but refuses to apologize to the caller and asks him to negotiate. He also calls him a terrorist, which angers him. Arjun realizes that there is a bomb in Subhash's earpiece as well, and warns him discreetly. But the caller observes this through CCTV footage and immediately explodes the bomb in Subhash's earpiece, fatally injuring him.This leaves Arjun extremely scared and nervous. But Ankita orders him to keep going and tells him to not make any negotiations with the caller, as they are tracing the location of the call and would get hold of him soon. Ankita also says to tell Raghubeer that no minister is coming to deliver his apology. she knows that Raghubeer will do some stupidity and kill more hostages on the bridge. This way he will be the villain, cops will catch him, the minister wont have to say sorry and Arjun can claim that he helped catch Raghubeer.
The caller threatens to detonate more explosives at the bridge which could kill many people, including Arjun's wife Soumya. Arjun decides to go ahead with fulfilling the caller's demands and requests him to come to the studio where the minister would give him an apology.This angers Ankita, who leaks information of Arjun having accepted a bribe to cover up the news of the same incident of the construction workers losing their lives while repairing the bridge, which had led to him being demoted. It is also revealed that sometime earlier, Arjun had won the ""Journalist of the Year"" award, for a report which he had actually stolen from Soumya, which had led to their divorce. Ankita exposes this truth as well, which is broadcast by another news channel. Ankita blackmails Arjun by saying that she can still handle the situation and he can save his career and reputation, if he acts as per her orders.
Arjun continues to parley with Raghubeer and manages to convince him to let women and children off the bridge. Raghubeer agrees if Soumya agrees to stay behind as collateral. But before the rescue can be completed, the bridge collapses and Soumya apparently dies.The ATS traces the caller's location to a nearby building, but it's a trap, and the caller blows up the building, the impact of which causes the studio to also get nearly destroyed. Arjun is alive but gravely injured. He suddenly realizes that the caller is actually Raghubeer's son Anand, who wants to avenge the death of his father and coworkers, and that he has been calling from the same building. Arjun summons him to the studio, while everything is still being broadcast live. Anand arrives and reveals that he has planted an explosive in the same building and intends to blow it up. Just then, he is sniped down by the ATS from a nearby building, instantly killing him (before dying Anand says that his dad Raghubeer used to trust only Arjun that's why he approached only Arjun). Arjun finds out that the bridge has collapsed and many people have lost their lives, including Soumya.
On having found out that Arjun, instead of informing the police first, had decided to exclusively cover this news, to get back his position as the prime time news anchor, Ankita leaks this information. Another news channel broadcasts this news adding a false story of Arjun being actively involved in planning the attack, labeling him as an anti-national. Arjun, devastated, apologizes to his ex-wife and then himself detonates the explosive in the same building, causing it to collapse, killing him as well."

She escapes and embarks on a journey through an empty parallel world leading her to a Quantum science research laboratory in the middle of nowhere. There she discovers tapes from Dr Charles Marland-White (Ian McKellen) and Professor Aaron Ostergaard (Conleth Hill) and their experiment involving human test subjects. The film follows Jane (Tori Butler-Hart) who wakes up in a strange attic, in a parallel world, with seemingly no way out. We soon realise that she is stuck in a time-loop, destined to relive the same day over and over with little memory of her doing it before. But with each 'reset' she starts to remember more and more and begins to piece together what may be happening to her, with clues pointing to a Professor Aaron Ostergaard (Conleth Hill).
As she makes her way to the mysterious Wytness Quantum Research Centre to find a way to stop it, she begins to get glimpses into other worlds and other versions of herself. But each time she seems to be getting closer to an answer she is immediately reset back to the attic she fears, to once more start her journey to learn the truth.
As she travels from the city to the hidden research centre in the middle of nowhere, she sees that the world is entirely empty. There is evidence that life was once here, houses, cars and zeppelins hovering above, but everything is boarded up and abandoned. At night however, Jane sees torches and helicopters in the distance and discovers that soldiers are searching for her, adding to her desperation to get to the research centre and look for answers that might send her home.
Once inside the centre the laws of time become erratic and Jane sees glimpses of people who are clearly living in another world, but whose actions are having an effect on the one she is trapped in, and those effects are growing worse with every 'reset'."

The Loud House Movie,2021,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6714432/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"With his parents and all 10 sisters in tow, Lincoln Loud heads to Scotland and learns that royalty runs in the family in this global musical journey. In Nickelodeon's The Loud House Movie, the biggest family on television goes on the biggest Loud family vacation ever. The adventure follows the Loud family to Scotland where they discover that they are descendants of Scottish royalty. The family quickly indulges in the most wish-fulfilling high-life ever when they discover their ancestral home is a castle.—Netflix Lincoln Loud doesn't feel special following the fact that he has 10 super star sisters. One night, his best friend accidentally gives him the idea of heading to Scotland. When he and his family arrive, Lincoln realizes that their ancestors were famous in Scotland and realizes that this is his chance to feel special. But things take a big turn when he becomes the duke of Loch Loud. In 1994, a man named Lynn Loud meets a crossing guard named Rita while walking down the street. They experience love at first sight, and Rita invites him out on a date. After many dates, the two of them get married, then buy a suburban house for them to live in. During their first year in the house, they give birth to their first child, a daughter named Lori, followed by four more daughters named Leni, Luna, Luan, and Lynn Jr. After they have five daughters, they give birth to their first son, an albino boy named Lincoln. After Lincoln, the two of them go on to have five more daughters named Lucy, Lana, Lola, Lisa, and Lily. In the present day (2017), Lincoln, who has become the family's ""man with the plan"" as he likes to call himself, teaches Lily how to create and execute a plan as they decide to be the first ones to eat their father's breakfast burritos. While their sisters end up getting ready before them, Lincoln is able to prevent them from further intervening in their plan by sending them out of the house against their will, noting how the key to having a plan is to always have a backup plan. After they begin eating their burritos, they soon learn that all of the girls have activities that day. Lincoln helps out his sisters, and they take home several awards after they finish their activities. That night, when the family goes out to eat, the girls pose for a group photo where they show off their awards. Lincoln attempts to join them in the photo because he is also part of the family and did plenty of work to help them, but he gets abusively shoved out of the frame and locked outside, and the public completely ignores him in favor of his sisters. This causes Lincoln to wish that he was special, and he decides to visit his best friend, Clyde. During the visit, Clyde talks about how he had recently taken a vacation to France, where he learned that he was descended from a long line of bakers and found out that he was just as skilled as his ancestors were. This inspires Lincoln to ask his family to take a vacation to their place of origin. After collecting a DNA sample from Lynn Sr., Lisa concludes that their family originated from Scotland, so the family takes a vacation there. Upon arriving in Scotland, they find themselves in a small town called Loch Loud, which, while still decently inhabited, is relatively dysfunctional and noticeably requires improvement. The Loud family soon learns that they are descended from royalty from a man named Angus, who works as the groundskeeper for their ancestral castle. After taking them to the castle, he introduces them to the castle's caretaker, Morag, who noticeably enjoys being in a peaceful and quiet setting more than anything. He then invites them to stay in the castle while on vacation, given that their ancestors lived in it. They accept the offer, and once they begin exploring the castle, Angus decides to talk to Lincoln after noticing his fascination with fame and recognition. He explains that the royal family was very special and well-known among the townspeople, but the most special of all of the Loud family's ancestors was Lincoln's double, who was the duke of the town. After being taken to the duke's room, Lincoln decides that he wants to be just like his ancestor. Suddenly, Lynn and Lana arrive in the duke's room, having noticed the cave near the castle with a prominent dragon motif, and ask Angus to explain why it exists. While Angus takes the two girls to the cave, he explains that dragons are an important part of the town's history, and the royal family owned a real dragon back in their time. Soon, he discovers that the only dragon egg left in the cave has hatched, meaning that a dragon is on the loose. After they catch up with the dragon, they bring it to the castle, where Lily names it Lela. Suddenly, Lincoln emerges from the duke's room, wearing the duke's clothes and having decided that he wants to become the duke. At dinner that night, Angus explains that the only way Lincoln can become the duke is by making an effort to help out the townspeople. The next day, Lincoln helps out the townspeople (with help from Angus, as he needed to learn along the way that being the duke is about more than being popular and self-entitled), which manages to convince them that he would make the perfect duke. However, Morag, who wants to regain her peace and quiet after the Loud family leaves, blurts out that Lincoln is a tourist, which causes the town's citizens to abandon him. Lincoln then convinces his family to move into the town, which they agree to after being manipulated by him, and he is later crowned as the duke. Soon, as Lincoln is enjoying himself, living as his ancestor did four hundred years before him, Morag sneaks away from the castle to the highlands, where she completely snaps and openly expresses her hatred for the Loud family. She then digs up her distant ancestor, Aggie's, journal, where she uncovers a dragon-controlling gem. She plots to use it to exile Lincoln from Scotland, just as her ancestor did to her duke. That night, Lucy summons the ghost of her distant ancestral double, Lucille, who explains the true story of the royal family's departure from Loch Loud: They left for a temporary amount of time, but upon returning, the duke's dragon friend, Lolo, attacked their ship. Lucille had assumed that Lolo had deemed her brother, the duke, to be worthy no more, and he thus handed over his crown before sending them all away to a new land. What none of them knew was that Aggie, the castle's historical caretaker, was controlling the dragon with a gem, and she had plotted to exile the duke from Scotland out of frustration for never getting a moment of peace and quiet as a result of the large royal family's presence. After Lucille finishes explaining the story of the royal family's departure, Morag arrives back at the castle, then eavesdrops on Lincoln, where she learns that his greatest weakness is being stuck in his sisters' shadows. She then decides to motivate him to abdicate the throne, then usurp the throne and become the duchess. The next day, she invites Lincoln's sisters to perform in front of the town, since their ancestors were widely known for their many areas of expertise. While Lincoln is cleaning out chimneys throughout the town later that day, he notices a flyer promoting his sisters performing in the town, which causes him to lose his confidence about being special and popular due to his royal status. Morag then convinces him to ride the dragon like his ancestor once did, and Lincoln agrees to the offer. Sure enough, the townspeople admire Lincoln as he rides the dragon, but during his dragon ride, Morag takes control of the dragon using the gem she found in Aggie's journal. With Morag now in control of the dragon, property destruction ensues throughout the town, and the townspeople blame Lincoln for it. They later form a mob against him, which motivates him to abdicate the throne and leave Scotland. After the Loud family leaves Scotland, Morag usurps the throne and becomes the duchess. Angus and the townspeople begin opposing her because this action is unlawful (as the Loud family did not give her consent to become the duchess after they left, as she claimed soon before her coronation), and not wanting to be opposed, Morag attacks the town using the dragon. Meanwhile, Lucille learns from Aggie's journal that Aggie betrayed the royal family back in their time and was responsible for the original duke abdicating the throne, and she soon reveals the truth to the current Loud family. After telling them that Morag is attacking the town and sending all of its residents into exile, they return to the town and battle against her. Lincoln soon confronts Morag face-to-face and begins to battle for the crown. However, they lose focus of where the dragon (which they are standing on) is going, and they crash through the castle walls. Morag prepares to kill the entire Loud family and Angus, but Lincoln is able to prevent this by attracting Morag away from them by taking the crown with him. During Morag's last-ditch effort to murder Lincoln, Lincoln uses a magic trick to replace the dragon-controlling gem with a burrito, then destroys the gem so Morag cannot control the dragon anymore. After another fight over the crown, they fall off a cliff, but the dragon manages to prevent them from dying. The dragon takes Lincoln back to the castle, but leaves Morag stranded on an island populated by noisy seals. After Lincoln arrives back at the castle, he decides that he does not deserve to be the duke and instead decides to crown Angus as the duke, since he knows the town better than anybody else. After doing so, the Loud family helps to rebuild the town together with Angus and the ghosts of their ancestors, then they leave Scotland to return back home, satisfied with how they have helped the town."

In an attempt to hide, he takes refuge behind an under-construction police station, from where he witnesses Georgekutty emerging from. He is then caught by the police and apprehended.Six years later, Georgekutty, Rani, Anju and Anu lead an affluent life. Georgekutty, now an owner of a movie theatre, yearns to produce a film, despite his family's objection. He is in constant touch with Vinayachandran, a prominent screenwriter, in order to develop screenplay for his project. Although the family is comfortable, Anju has repeated fits of epilepsy and is now a PTSD patient, a consequence of her fear of getting arrested in connection to Varun's murder. Jealous of the family's meteoric rise in wealth, Georgekutty's neighbors start spreading rumors tarnishing the family's image, especially Anju's, much to Rani's distress. Her only source of solace is her friendly neighbor Saritha, although the duo's friendship is not accepted by Saritha's abusive husband, Sabu.The police, having received much humiliation due to their inability to solve Varun's case, decide to reinvestigate the case, under the supervision of IG Thomas Bastin. Meanwhile, Georgekutty encounters Prabhakar, who begs him to disclose the location of Varun's body so that he can collect his skeleton to perform funeral rites, but to no avail. Anu returns home on a spring break and hosts a sleepover party with her friends, despite Rani's protests. One night, Rani conveys to Saritha of her fears of getting arrested and inadvertently blurts the fact that Georgekutty had moved Varun's body. Unbeknownst to her and the family, Saritha and Sabu are actually undercover cops, assigned by Bastin in an attempt to discover the location of Varun's body. Among his other spies was Anumol's boyfriend.Meanwhile, Jose is released from prison. After overhearing Georgekutty's case from townspeople, he recollects about having seen him at the then-unfinished police station and promptly tips off the police. Bastin informs this to Geetha and Prabhakar, who arrives from the US to oversee the new developments on the case. Relying on Jose's information, the authorities excavate the police station, eventually discovering a human skeleton. Georgekutty learns these events through surveillance cameras. He and his family are then apprehended and questioned by the police. To make matters worse, Rani's earlier revelation to Saritha had been recorded; Saritha and Sabu had bugged Georgekutty's house. Geetha's brash questioning results in Anju having another epileptic fit.Distraught, Georgekutty gives in a fabricated story in which he is the murderer of Varun, for which he claims he has preserved evidence. After they are let go, the family muse about their supposedly bleak future. After Georgekutty is formally arrested and tried, Vinayachandran meets with Bastin, Geetha and Prabhakar. He reveals that, on Georgekutty's recommendation, their screenplay was published as a novel titled Drishyam under Vinayachandran's name for protecting copyright. In their novel, the hero successfully manages to hide the body, but when discovered, he gives a false confession to save his child. Bastin then realises that Georgekutty's recorded confession matches with Drishyam's plot. In the court, Georgekutty pleads not guilty, his lawyer argues that the police had used the book's plot to frame Georgekutty. Much to the police's shock, the DNA results of the tests conducted on the human skeleton do no match with that of Varun's.Shocked, Vinayachandran reveals that Georgekutty had an alternate climax for his film, in which the hero, attempting to evade capture, would learn about the procedures conducted when such a skeleton is found on that location, Idukki district. The hero would then procure the skeleton of another youngster who had died with injuries similar to that of Varun's, by befriending a local gravedigger. He would further befriend the security guard of the medical institution where the forensic tests of the discovered skeleton would be conducted. On the day the original skeleton is dug up and send to forensic lab, he would discreetly switch the victim's skeleton with the one he procured, while cremating the original one, thus destroying all incriminating evidence.As per Vinayachandran's narration, it is revealed that Georgekutty had followed suit. With no incriminating evidence to prove his culpability, Georgekutty is released. His lawyer requests the court to direct the police to stop proceeding against Georgekutty for the time being as he is moving to High Court to quash the proceedings against him. Georgekutty later has Varun's cremated skeleton discreetly handed over to Geetha and Prabhakar, who floats his ashes in river. Bastin urges them to end their spat with Georgekutty, as they will never succeed in punishing him. He tells that Georgekutty's vigilant life itself is a punishment; he must live the rest of his life with constant supervision, caution and guilt. The couple apparently agrees with him. Meanwhile, Georgekutty, watching the trio from afar, silently leaves."

Almost exclusively, one-setting horror/thrillers are precious gems that do a whole lot with very little. When you're immersed in piecing together the puzzle and figuring out who the main character is, a film that falls under this category is dynamite. Charlie (Emily Bennett) is setting the atmosphere in her sleek, two-story apartment in Brooklyn for a romantic homecoming for her distant girlfriend Simone (Emma Myles) who's been away for work. There are past glimpses of visual tension between the two, so we're led to feel that this meticulous setting of mood may be a peacemaking gesture. Enamored beyond all good sense, Charlie begins to experience a myriad of unsettling incidents (an unstable voice from a vent, shadows that appear, eerie WiFi disruptions), and the horrors of what has transpired are slowly revealed in the shards of Charlie's resistant memory. They delightfully manifest in all those horror trope faves, yet still feel like a ripe pick off the branch.

Kabilan manages to defeat Rose, much to the surprise and dismay of the audience. Enraged, Vembuli challenges Kabilan to defeat him in the ring. Raman's uncle Thaniga, who feuded with Kabilan's father in the past, plots against Kabilan for humiliating Raman. He tells Vembuli that he would help him if he is on verge of losing. In the match, Kabilan dominates Vembuli most of the match and almost knocks him out in fourth round. The fifth (last) round starts, but is stopped suddenly as the police come into the venue to arrest Rangan, as the DMK government has been dismissed minutes ago by the Union government and Governor has ordered the arrest of all prominent DMK leaders. Everyone refuses to move until the match ends, and the police wait for the last round to end. The last round resumes, and as Kabilan is to give the final blow to the tired and hopeless Vembuli, Thaniga's goons attacks Kabilan and interrupt the match. Goons attack all the spectators and strip Kabilan naked on stage. The match ends in no result. Rangan and other party members are immediately jailed under the MISA Act. Kabilan is injured in the back of head, but recovers.Kabilan decides to quit boxing after the incident and plans to live a modest life with his mother and his wife Mariyamma.

In a fit of rage, Kabilan hacks Thaniga's mouth with a sword, he gets imprisoned for six months, though Thaniga survives. In 1978, Vetri Selvan joined the ruling AIADMK, led by Chief minister M. G. Ramachandran. He and Kabilan initially work under Manja Kannan to brew illegal liquor, and eventually start their own brewing business due to Vetri's clout in the party. Vetri, despite growing rich, employs Kabilan as his mere henchman. Kabilan slowly slips into alcoholism which strains his relationship with his mother and his wife.Rangan is released from prison in 1979 and is disturbed by the changes. Kabilan, now overweight and addicted to alcohol, attends the boxing match between Raman and Vembuli, where the former gets defeated thoroughly. Post match, Vembuli gets challenged by Kabilan and Daddy due to his intentional disruption before. An embarrassed Vembuli accepts but Rangan wants to use another boxer instead, due to Kabilan's lack of fitness and flexibility. However Kabilan stands his ground and insists the fight go on. Vetri asks him to join the liquor trade full time, but is angrily rejected. Kabilan wails to Bakkiyam over the fact that he failed both as a family member and a boxer. Bakkiyam, tells Kabilan to resume boxing to redeem himself (She prevented him from boxing earlier, because she did not want him to become a thug). The following day, Daddy sends Kabilan to train under 'Beedi' Rayappan, a fisherman, Munirathnam's friend and former legendary Sarpatta boxer. Under Rayappan's guidance, he regains his fitness and improves his game. In the match, Vembuli dominates in the early rounds and dislocates Kabilan's left shoulder decreasing his punch power and movements, but Rangan, Vetri, Meeran and other members show up and motivate Kabilan to perform his best. In the final round Kabilan knocks Vembuli out, and the Sarpatta clan gains its prime-match victory after years of failure."
