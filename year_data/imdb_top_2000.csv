Inside a snowflake exists the magical land of Whoville, wherein live the Whos, an almost-mutated sort of Munchkin-like people who all love Christmas. Just outside of their beloved town lives the Grinch (Jim Carrey), a nasty creature that hates Christmas and plans to steal it from the Whos, which he equally abhors. Little Cindy Lou Who (Taylor Momsen) decides to befriend the Grinch.—Filmfreak <webmaster@filmfreak.co.za> In this live-action adaptation of the beloved children's tale byDr. Seuss, the reclusive green Grinch (Jim Carrey) decides to ruin Christmas for the cheery citizens of Whoville. Reluctantly joined by his hapless dog Max (Kelley), the Grinch comes down from his mountaintop home and sneaks into town to swipe everything Christmas-related from the Whos. However, the bitter grump finds a hitch in his plans when he encounters the endearing Cindy Lou Who (Taylor Momsen)—Jwelch5742 In the outskirts of Whoville, a green hermit known as the Grinch has been living in Mount Crumpit with his only friend and pet dog, Max. It is soon discovered the Grinch has put himself in exile, due to his hatred for Christmas and after he was bullied by his former school peers after he tried to impress his childhood crush and only female friend, Martha May Whovier, but that ended in humiliation for the Grinch, after Augustus Maywho (the corrupt mayor of Whoville) has began belittling him even further. However, Cindy Lou Who, the daughter of Lou and Betty, believes that there is good in the Grinch. At the same time, Cindy realizes that Christmas is about being with loved ones and it shouldn't be about materialism. The Grinch devises a plot to ruin Christmas by dressing up as Santa in retaliation for being ridiculed and for the citizens endless greed for gifts.—dawsonpersi Rejected by the Whos as a child, and living in spiteful seclusion for most of his life, the Grinch (Jim Carrey) has always hated the citizens of Whoville. That especially goes for Christmas with the Whos' noise, phony sentiment, and wasteful materialism. When little Cindy Lou Who's (Taylor Momsen's) attempt to transcend the festivities' empty commercialism by inviting the Grinch ends with his public humiliation, the Grinch hatches upon on his supreme scheme to ruin Christmas. Cindy Lou Who becomes a great friend to the Grinch and stops the Grinch from destroying a wonderful holiday, and the Grinch is now welcome in Whoville.—Kenneth Chisholm <kchishol@home.com> On a tiny snowflake floating through the air, exists the town of Who-ville, home of the Whos. The town is joyously preparing for the coming of Christmas.However, of all the Whose, a little girl named Cindy Lou Who is feeling depressed, and not at all in the holiday spirit. When her brother and his friends return from climbing Mt Crumpit and claim they saw the Grinch, Cindy Lou grows curious as to the Grinch, who she learns does not like Christmas. While in the Post Office with her Father, Cindy takes some mail to a backroom, and finds the Grinch trying to cause havoc in the mail room. The Grinch scares her, and causes Cindy to fall into the mail sorting machine. To her surprise, the Grinch rescues her.Cindy then decides to investigate more into the Grinch's past, and interviews several people, including two elderly women who cared for the Grinch, as well as town socialite Margaret May-Who and the Mayor, both of whom were classmates with the Grinch.From the information she collects, the Grinch as a child actually liked Christmas, and even had a crush on Margaret. However, the Mayor as a child, taunted the Grinch about this. The Grinch tries to create a hand-made present for Margaret and shave off his facial hair, but the bad shaving job causes the class to laugh at him, finally causing him to hate Christmas. After that, he ran away to Mt Crumpit.As Christmas approaches, the Mayor announces the upcoming Who-bilation, where the town nominates a Cheer Meister. While the Mayor looks forward to another unanimous vote for himself, Cindy requests that they nominate the Grinch, feeling he deserves it the most.With enough votes, Cindy gets the Grinch a nomination, and climbs up Mt Crumpit to deliver it to him. The Grinch does not believe her at first, but reconsiders when he finds out he'll be receiving an award, and that Margaret May-Who will be attending. The Grinch agonizes over the decision to attend (partly believing this is a trick), before appearing to the Who's.While at first apprehensive, the Grinch appears to be getting into the Christmas spirit, until the Mayor proposes to Martha May-Who, and offers her a car. The ostentatious gift rouses the ire of the Grinch, and he then begins to wreck the celebration, causing mayhem and burning down the Christmas tree. Cindy feels terrible that her plan to make the Grinch feel better has been ruined, and the Grinch returns to Mt Crumpit.The Grinch feeling worse then ever, decides that this year, he'll stop Christmas from coming, by dressing as Santa, and stealing it. Fashioning a sled, he and his dog Max return to Who-Ville, and make off with all the gifts and festive trimmings. Taking everything to the top of Mt Crumpit, he plans to drop it all over the edge.Back in Who-ville, everyone is sad and distraught, with the Mayor blaming the whole thing on Cindy for inviting the Grinch. Cindy's father proclaims that he actually is proud of his daughter, because he's seen that Christmas is not about presents and decorations, but about being together. Soon a number of other Who's join in and begin singing.This sound causes the Grinch to pause, wondering how they can be so cheerful. As he watches, the emotion gets to him, and his once shrivelled heart grows 3 sizes. The Grinch then returns the presents to Who-ville, and apologizes for his misdeed. At the same time, Margaret May-Who tells the Mayor she is rejecting his marriage proposal, and that her heart belongs to the Grinch.In the closing of the film, the town feast is held, with the Grinch carving the Roast Beast."
Cast Away,2000,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0162222/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A FedEx executive undergoes a physical and emotional transformation after crash landing on a deserted island. Memphis-based FedEx operations executive Chuck Noland and grad student Kelly Frears have long dated and lived together, and despite each being the love of the other's life, have not gotten married because of their respective busy schedules, especially Chuck's as he is more often on business trips than he is at home. That marital status changes when on Christmas Day 1995 as Chuck is rushing off to catch yet another FedEx plane for a business trip, he gives Kelly a ring. That flight experiences technical difficulties, and goes down somewhere in the south Pacific. In a life raft, a relatively unharmed Chuck washes up on shore what he will learn is a deserted island, he unaware what has happened to any of his fellow flight mates, or the plane. However several of the packages on board for delivery do wash up on shore with him, those packages which he initially treats with respect. Chuck realizes that his priority is survival - which primarily means food, water, shelter and fire - and rescue. But survival is also in an emotional sense. To fulfill that emotional need, he has an heirloom pocket watch with Kelly's photo that she gave him as a Christmas present, and eventually opening the FedEx packages, a Wilson volleyball on which he paints a face and which he names Wilson. As time progresses, Chuck goes through a range of emotions, but if rescue is ever in the cards, he realizes that he has to find a way to get off the island, which is seemingly impossible in his circumstance due to the strong on shore surf he cannot get beyond without assistance. What Chuck may not fully realize is the longer he is not rescued, the harder it will be for him to return to his old life in its entirety if he ever is rescued. Although the thought of Kelly is what largely keeps him motivated to be rescued, Kelly, who probably believes him to be dead, may have moved on emotionally from him in the intervening time.—Huggo Flying from one country to another, troubleshooting problems and arranging package transfers all over the world, the driven but overworked and time-obsessed Federal Express executive, Chuck Noland, is living a hectic life. In 1995, against the backdrop of the impending New Year's Eve, an unforeseen complication forces Noland to leave his sad but understanding girlfriend, Kelly, behind, and catch a plane to Malaysia, only to end up marooned on an uncharted, uninhabited island in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. Suddenly, for the first time in a long while, Chuck has all the time in the world; however, bereft of the comforts of civilisation, tending to his fundamental needs now becomes a constant struggle. Now, Chuck, the only living soul on the islet, must summon up the strength to survive. But, can he resist despair, and maintain hope to stay alive?—Nick Riganas After FedEx systems engineer Chuck Noland is ripped out of his hasty life by the clock in a plane crash, he finds himself alone on the shores of a tropical island. First, frustration gets to him and then he realizes how little his chances are to ever get back to civilization. Four years later, Chuck has learned very well how to survive on his own: mending his dental health, catching fish with a spear, predicting the weather with a self-made calendar. A photograph of his girlfriend Kelly has kept his hopes alive all these years. Finally, Chuck takes the opportunity to take off for home: he sets off on a wooden raft with a sail that has washed ashore.—Julian Reischl <julianreischl@mac.com> Chuck Noland is a FedEx manager who demands that everything must be on time and travels the world to make sure punctuality is on top of everything else. He has a girlfriend, Kelly, with whom he is deeply in love with and family he hardly sees. When work intrudes on Christmas Eve, Chuck has a quick gift exchange in the car and kisses Kelly goodbye. He boards a delivery plane going overseas which gets caught in a horrendous storm and crashes into the Pacific. The sole survivor Chuck washes up on a remote island along with several FedEx packages that he must use for supplies. With limited luxury, he adapts to the island over the course of 1,500 nights. When Chuck finally sees his chance he rafts out on the ocean and fortunately is spotted. After a bittersweet welcome-back reception, Chuck finds Kelly has married another man and has children. But he is missing more than her. For all his life his objective was work. For four years, it was survival. Now Chuck is compelled to live.—Donnel Hoffman Chuck Nolan (Tom Hanks) is a systems engineer for Federal Express. He shows some Moscow (Russia) staff how FedEx does business. The most important thing he tells them about is time: that the package sorting must be completed precisely on schedule. To prove it, he opens a package he sent to himself from FedEx's headquarters and his home base in Memphis, Tennessee, that contains a small timer. Chuck stops it at 87 hours, which he says is a deplorable delivery time considering FedEx's chief business strategy of delivering packages overnight. While yelling at the staff, the translator brings up a past incident where Chuck stole a kid's bike when his delivery vehicle broke down. Chuck insists that the story has been hyperbolized and that he merely borrowed the bike and that he still got his deliveries done. Chuck launches the crew into the package sort with a time limit of three hours. With 15 minutes left, the sort is threatened when one of the Moscow office's trucks is booted in Red Square. The package sorting is carried out in the street. He calls his girlfriend, Kelly (Helen Hunt) and leaves a message saying he'll be back there in less than 24 hours and that he needs to see a dentist for a tooth that's bothering him. After the sort is done and he's back at the airport, he talks to his coworker and friend Stan (Nick Searcy). One of the crew asks about Stan's wife, who's been battling cancer and isn't doing well. The mood turns somber and Chuck looks thoughtful about the news.Chuck returns to Memphis, FedEx headquarters, and visits Kelly, who is a PhD student. During dinner with her family on Christmas Eve, he gets a message that he needs to go to Malaysia. They drive to his departure point at the airport and they exchange their Christmas gifts. He gives her a bunch of kitchen items, she gives him an antique watch that belonged to her grandfather. Inside the lid is a picture of her. Chuck is quite taken with the watch and promises her he'll always keep it set to Memphis time to remind him to come home. Right before he leaves for his plane, he gives her a small ring box. Though it's not shown explicitly, it's an engagement ring. He'd planned to propose on New Year's Eve but decided to do it earlier. He tells her ""Ill be right back."" He is the only passenger and rides in the jump seat of a FedEx cargo MD-11 across the Pacific Ocean.Chuck wakes up when the plane bumps in some turbulence. The plane has encountered a fierce storm. The pilots attempt to fly around it but they've fallen out of radio contact with Fiji. Chuck goes to the bathroom to freshen up a bit. Suddenly the door flies open and Chuck is nearly sucked out of the plane due to depressurization. He gets back to his seat and is given a life raft by one of the crew. The plane goes straight down and crashes in the ocean. Water rushes into the fuselage in a flash. Chuck makes it to the surface and climbs in the raft, seeing one of the engines explode. Chuck passes out and is washed onto the shore of a very small tropical island. He discovers immediately that his pager is waterlogged and that Kelly's watch is equally ruined. He also finds out very quickly that he's alone, though the sound of falling coconuts trick him into thinking someone else may be stalking him. Desperate to find food and fresh water, Chuck spends a lengthy time trying to open a coconut. When throwing them at a large rock and smashing them on a smaller rock fail, he uses a sharp rock to finally cut the shell. He's also able to spear small crabs but without any fire to cook them, they aren't a good food source.He explores the island, finding a small cave in the rock and finds a total of eleven FedEx packages from the crash that have washed ashore. He also discovers the body of one of the aircraft's pilots and buries him. At night on the beach Chuck sees the lights of a ship. Using a small flashlight he recovered from the body of the pilot, he tries to signal the ship but is unsuccessful.The next morning he attempts to leave the island in the rubber raft from the jet. The high breakers over the coral reef surrounding the island turn the raft over. He's tossed onto the reef and his thigh is badly lacerated. Recovering from the accident. he begins to build a simple camp and opens the FedEx parcels. He discovers several items that aid him in his survival including a pair of ice skates, a leather and lace dress, videotapes and a legal document declaring a divorce. Another parcel contains a volley ball that eventually becomes his companion. One of the parcels is decorated with a pair of wings and for unexplained reasons he doesn't open it. He tries to build a fire by rubbing a stick against a piece of wood, but cuts his hand. In a fury, he grabs the volley ball and throws it. His cut hand leaves a bloody imprint on the ball and from that he adds in a face, naming it by its brand name, ""Wilson"". The ball becomes his companion. Sometime later he describes to Wilson the flight path of his jet compared to its last known position and calculates that the search area is over 500,000 square miles, twice the size of Texas. He realizes its doubtful that he'll ever be found.Chuck uses the lace from the dress as a fishing net, eating a small minnow he catches raw, though he's clearly repulsed by it. He also spends a lengthy amount of time rubbing two sticks together to build a fire. The process is frustrating but Chuck perseveres, refining his technique and finally gets a large fire going. Chuck creates a rudimentary home in a small cave that shields him from tropical storms that occasionally hit the island. Still suffering from the tooth that was bothering him before he left Memphis, it has abscessed and is extremely painful and swollen. Desperate, he finally resorts to using the sharp end of an ice skate blade with a rock as a hammer to extract the tooth.Four years pass. Chuck has lost more than 50 pounds and his hair and beard are long and unkempt. He survives day-to-day. During a storm two of the walls of a broken fiberglass portable toilet are tossed on shore. When he sees it blown by the wind, he is suddenly energized with the idea of building a raft that will use the fiberglass walls like a makeshift sail that could possibly get him over the larger breakers surrounding the island. He chops down trees and lays out his raft. To tie the poles together, he braids rope from local tree bark and from the video tape. He counts the days necessary to catch the northeast trade winds that he hopes will take him into the shipping lanes and rescue. Chuck isn't certain where he is headed but figures that he would rather die at sea that spend the rest of his life alone on the island. At one point he imagines that Wilson is telling him the plan won't work and he punts Wilson out of his cave. Immediately remorseful, Chuck runs outside and finds Wilson, apologizing to him.Chuck prepares food, water, and other necessities for his escape. He also tells Wilson that he'll have to ""make rope again."" Chuck cuts down saplings on the island and peels the bark from them to braid. When he finishes scouring the island and finds he's cut down every sapling he can, he tells Wilson he'll have to make the rest of the rope from videotape, which won't be as strong as the tree bark. When Wilson ""suggests"" where Chuck can get more rope, Chuck becomes very reluctant. The extra rope was a length Chuck had made when he was contemplating suicide a few years before. Chuck climbs to the top of the island's peak and retrieves the rope, which he'd tied to a dummy of himself to test it.Chuck ties his 'companion' Wilson and the FedEx parcel decorated with wings to the raft. With the new sail and a pair of makeshift oars, he's able to sail over the reef surf and escape the island and lagoon. He sails for many encounters a few storms -- the sail doubles as a shelter -- and continues fishing and collecting rainwater to survive. One day, following a heavy storm, an exhausted Chuck is awakened by water in his face, apparently from the spout of a whale, and sees Wilson floating away. He tries to rescue Wilson but, afraid of losing the raft, he is forced to let Wilson go. He is despondent over losing Wilson. He has nearly given up hope of rescue when he is wakened by another whale's spout. He turns over to see a container ship passing close by. They signal that they've seen him.A month later, Chuck is flown home to Memphis and is the guest of honor at a large company-organized welcome reception. On the plane back, he talks to Stan who tells Chuck they had a funeral with a coffin that they filled with small items in Chuck's honor. Stan's wife also had passed away during Chuck's time away and Chuck reflects on how Stan had to go through two funerals very close together. The reception is attended by FedEx's president, Fred Smith (in a cameo appearance) and a large buffet is served -- Chuck looks thoughtfully at the large crab legs that were served, perhaps thinking of fishing for crabs on the island.Kelly intended to meet Chuck at the celebration but she is feeling very confused. Her husband (Chris Noth), an orthodontist that did dental work on Chuck, apologizes for her absence. He tells Chuck that Kelly is having a difficult time coping with the his sudden reappearance. He asks Chuck to give her more time. Looking out of the window he sees Kelly in tears, comforted by her husband, and watches her get in a car and leave.Later that evening, Chuck takes a taxi to Kelly's home. She seems to be expecting him and invites him inside. They talk about little things and he discovers how much her life and ambitions have changed and how she coped with his presumed death. Chuck gives Kelly back the watch she had given him telling her that it is a family heirloom and should remain in her family. She tells him that the company presumed a hazardous package caught fire and caused the crash. She shows him that his island was more than 600 miles from the Cook Islands around which the search had been conducted. He had drifted 500 miles in his raft before he was found. He decides to keep her picture. She gives him the keys to his Jeep which she had kept. They apologize to each other for all that has happened and he drives off slowly in the pouring rain.Kelly suddenly runs after him, shouting his name. He backs up and they embrace fiercely in the pouring rain. She tells him that she always believed he was alive, but that others said she had to move on. She tells him that he's the love of her life. He says he loves her too. They talk for a few more minutes in his car but Chuck tells Kelly that she needs to go home, signifying his respect for her moving on with her life.Chuck later describes the meeting with Kelly to Stan, and how he understands and accepts that while they will always love each other, their lives have gone in different directions and they cannot be together. He confesses to the utter despair and helplessness he felt on the island, describes his failed attempt at suicide, and how he received assurance that he was supposed to live and came to terms with his isolation. While he has just lost her again, he accepts it and understands he has to take live one day at a time because you never know what the tide will bring.He drives to Texas with the FedEx package decorated with wings in his Jeep. He attempts to deliver it at a ranch with a wrought-iron gate reading ""Bettina"" but no one is there. He leaves it at the door with a note stating that the parcel saved his life. He drives south and at a four-way intersection and gets out of his car to look at a map. A friendly, pretty woman in an old pick-up truck stops and asks him if he is lost. Smiling, he confesses he hasn't made up his mind where he was going. She tells him where the four roads lead, and that north, the direction Chuck had just come from, leads to a whole lot of nothingness all the way to Canada. She drives north and as she pulls away, Chuck spots the same pair of wings that were on the package on the tail gate of her truck. Chuck walks to the center of the intersection and looks in each direction for a few seconds. He then turns north and his gaze lingers in the direction the woman drove."
Mission: Impossible II,2000,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120755/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"IMF agent Ethan Hunt is sent to Sydney to find and destroy a genetically modified disease called ""Chimera"". Chimera is a deadly virus that will bear a grisly death unless you are given the antidote. The creator of Chimera is murdered and the antidote is stolen by a disavowed I.M.F. Agent, Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott). The Impossible Mission Force, (I.M.F.), hire the skilled and charming Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise), and the beautiful Nyah Hall (Thandie Newton), who has had her share with Ambrose. Their mission, should they choose to accept it, is to send Hall undercover to Ambrose and learn what she can for Hunt to bring down Chimera, but they will have to break into a secure lab by jumping off of buildings and dodging bullets. Its impossible. Director John Woo brings Hong Kong-style martial arts action to this comic book-flavored sequel that eschews the complicated plot and political maneuverings of its predecessor in favor of pure, adrenaline-charged thrills. Tom Cruise returns as Ethan Hunt, an operative for the top-secret government agency I.M.F. (Impossible Missions Force). Fellow Agent Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott) has gone rogue, stealing a sample of a deadly synthetic virus named Chimera that could rapidly wipe out the world's population. Ambrose's plan is to sell Chimera to the highest bidder in exchange for shares of stock in the winner's company. Summoned by the new I.M.F. Chief (Sir Anthony Hopkins in an uncredited cameo role), Ethan is assigned to recruit the help of Ambrose's former lover Nyah Hall (Thandie Newton), a gorgeous woman who left Ambrose, and who may be able to quickly regain his confidence. Once he meets and spends a night with Nyah, however, Ethan is smitten, and now must both capture Ambrose and keep Nyah alive as she infiltrates a nest of vipers. I.M.F. Agent Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) has been sent on a mission to retrieve and destroy the supply of a genetically created disease called ""Chimera"". His mission is made impossible due to the fact that he is not the only person after samples of the disease. He must also contest with a gang of international terrorists, headed by a rogue former I.M.F. Agent, who has already managed to steal the cure called ""Bellerophon"", and now needs ""Chimera"" to complete their grand plan of infecting the whole world. In order to infiltrate and locate the terrorist group he relies on the help of international thief Nyah Hall (Thandie Newton), who he quickly develops a love interest. Time is not only running out for Agent Hunt to find and destroy ""Chimera"" before the terrorists get their hands on it, but he must also find ""Bellerophon"" so as to save his love interest, who has already become infected by the disease from a terrible and rapid death.—Javert-5 A scientist, who is a friend of I.M.F. Agent Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise), who is in Sydney, Australia, wants him to escort him to Atlanta, Georgia, which he does. While on the plane, something bizarre happens and Ethan kills the scientist. It is then revealed that Ethan is not Ethan, but someone posing as him. He and his cohorts jump out of the plane and then proceed to crash it into a mountain. The real Ethan is then summoned by his superior for a mission, but before undertaking it, he is instructed to recruit a woman named Nyah Hall (Thandie Newton), who is a thief, to help them. He does and goes to meet his boss, who tells him about his friend and the crash. He then tells him since Ethan was unavailable, he sent another Agent, Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott), who, like Ethan, is a disguise expert. They then conclude that Ambrose was the one who crashed the plane and took what his friend was carrying, which he called ""Chimera"". Ethan's mission is to get it back. He is then told that Nyah is Sean's old girlfriend and that he wants her back. Ethan is hesitant because it seems that the two of them have connected, but is convinced that she is their best chance to find Ambrose, so he asks her, and she agrees.—rcs0411@yahoo.com Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise), while vacationing, is alerted by the IMF that someone has used his identity to assist Russian bio-chemical expert Dr. Vladimir Nekhorvich (Rade Serbedzija) of Biocyte Pharmaceuticals to enter the United States, but purposely crashed the commercial airliner en route. Nekhorvich, an old friend of Ethan, had forewarned the IMF of his arrival, planning to deliver a new virus called Chimera and its cure, Bellerophon, both of which he was forced to develop by Biocyte, into the IMF's hands. With the crash of the plane, IMF is worried that the virus is out in the open, believing that rogue IMF agent Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott) is behind the incident. IMF assigns Ethan to recover it. Ethan is told that he can use two members of his team to help him, but the third person to help him must be Nyah Nordoff-Hall (Thandie Newton), a professional thief presently operating in Seville, Spain as she will be able to get close to Ambrose, being an ex-girlfriend of his.After recruiting Nyah, Ethan meets his team, computer expert Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames) and pilot Billy Baird (John Polson) in Sydney, Australia, where Biocyte laboratories are located along with Ambrose's headquarters. As Ethan and the others stake out Biocyte, Nyah gets close to Ambrose and begins to find any information related to the Chimera virus. At a horse racing event, Ambrose quietly meets with Biocyte's CEO, John C. McCloy (Brendan Gleeson), and shows him a video of the Chimera virus affecting one of Nekhorvich's colleagues taken from Biocyte, using the footage to force McCloy to cooperate with them. Nyah is able to steal the video footage long enough to transfer it to Ethan and his team, who learn that the Chimera virus has a 20-hour dormant period before it causes death through mass destruction of the victim's red blood cells. This is depicted through several increasingly graphic pictures, which show the victim dead after 37 hours. Bellerophon can only save the victim if used within the 20-hour window.The IMF team kidnaps McCloy and learns that Nekhorvich had actually injected himself with Chimera, the only way he could smuggle the virus from Biocyte, and had all the known samples of Bellerophon, now presently in Ambrose's hands. Ambrose has blackmailed McCloy to sell him the virus for £37,000,000 and promising to return the samples of Bellerophon. Ethan's team plans to break into Biocyte and destroy the virus. Ambrose, posing as Ethan, tricks Nyah into revealing Ethan's plan. Ambrose secures Nyah and prepares to raid Biocyte himself to secure the virus. Ethan is able to destroy all but one sample of the virus before Ambrose interrupts him, and an ensuing firefight begins. Ethan learns that Ambrose is holding Nyah and stops firing, during which Ambrose orders Nyah to retrieve the last sample. When she does so, she injects herself with it, thus preventing Ambrose from simply killing her to get it. As Ambrose takes Nyah, Ethan escapes from the laboratory and starts a 20-hour countdown before the virus takes over Nyah's body.Ambrose opts to let Nyah wander the streets of Sydney in a daze, and orders McCloy to effectively hand over enough control of Biocyte to make him the majority shareholder, or else Nyah's infection will cause a pandemic that will kill 17 million people in Australia alone; Ambrose's plan is to make a fortune when prices of Biocyte's stock skyrocket due to demand for Bellerophon. Ethan's team is able to locate and infiltrate the meeting, stealing the samples of Bellerophon while taking out many of Ambrose's men. Luther and Billy locate Nyah who has wandered to a cliff side, intent on killing herself to prevent Chimera from spreading. As the two IMF agents bring Nyah to Ethan, he and Ambrose engage in a fist fight and wilds out on Ambrose. With little time left on the 20-hour countdown, Ethan finally gains the upper hand over Ambrose and shoots him dead, and then Luther injects Nyah with Bellerophon. Ethan reports to IMF on the successful mission. IMF clears Nyah's criminal record, and allows Ethan to continue his vacation with her in Sydney."

Before his death, the Emperor chooses Maximus to be his heir over his own son, Commodus, and a power struggle leaves Maximus and his family condemned to death. The powerful general is unable to save his family, and his loss of will allows him to get captured and put into the Gladiator games until he dies.

But will the popular general ever find peace in a long-awaited retribution?—Nick Riganas In Gladiator, victorious general Maximus Decimus Meridias has been named keeper of Rome and its empire by dying emperor Marcus Aurelius, so that rule might pass from the Caesars back to the people and Senate.

Marcus tells Lucilla he asked her to come because her brother, who's very fond of her, will soon need her more than ever.Marcus appoints the morally-upstanding Maximus as his successor, with the understanding that Maximus will eventually restore the Roman Republic by returning power to the senate. Maximus, longing to go home to his wife and son, tries to decline the honor, but Marcus Aurelius insists that not wanting the job makes Maximus the best man for it. At the end of a wrenching interview in which Commodus accuses his father of not recognizing his virtues and never loving him, Commodus confesses that all he ever wanted was his father's love and approval -- and then he smothers him.Declaring himself emperor, Commodus asks Maximus for his loyalty, which Maximus, realizing Commodus' involvement in Marcus Aurelius's death, refuses. Commodus orders Maximus arrested and executed and dispatches Praetorian guards to murder Maximus's wife (Giannina Facio) and young son (Giorgio Cantarini). Maximus narrowly escapes his execution and races home only to discover his family's charred and crucified bodies in the smoldering ruins of his villa. After burying his wife and son, a grieving Maximus succumbs to exhaustion and collapses on their graves.Slave traders find Maximus and take him to Zucchabar, a rugged province in North Africa, where he is purchased by Proximo (Oliver Reed), the head of a gladiator school. Distraught and nihilistic over the death of his family and betrayal by his empire, Maximus initially refuses to fight, but as he defends himself in the arena his formidable combat skills lead to a rise in popularity with the audience. As he trains and fights further, Maximus befriends Hagen (Ralf Moeller), a Germanic barbarian, and Juba (Djimon Hounsou), a Numidian hunter. Juba becomes a close friend and confidant of the grieving Maximus, and the two speak frequently of the afterlife and Maximus' eventual reunification with his family.In Rome, Commodus reopens the gladiatorial games to commemorate his father's death, declaring 150 days of celebration in a bid to win the affections of the Roman populace. Proximo's company of gladiators is hired to participate. Proximo tells Maximus that his abilities as a fighter won't be enough in Rome; he needs to win the affections of the audience. Maximus at first doesn't like the idea of playing to the crowd, but Proximo explains that it might save his life, revealing that he himself used to be a gladiator, and after gaining popularity was freed by the Emperor Marcus Aurelius -- he shows Maximus the wooden sword he received at the time. Maximus is incredulous at first (""You knew Marcus Aurelius?""), but then realizes this strategy might get him close enough to Commodus to get his revenge.In a recreation of the Battle of Zama (incorrectly named the Battle of Carthage) at the Colosseum, Maximus leads Proximo's gladiators to decisive victory against a more powerful force, much to the amazement of the crowd. Commodus descends into the arena to meet the victors and is stunned to discover that the leader of Proximo's gladiators is Maximus. The emperor, unable to kill Maximus because of the crowd's roaring approval for him, gives the thumbs-up sign allowing Maximus to live and sulks out of the arena.As the games continue, Commodus pits Maximus against Tigris of Gaul (Sven-Ole Thorsen), Rome's only undefeated gladiator, in an arena surrounded by chained tigers with handlers instructed to target Maximus. Following an intense battle, Maximus narrowly defeats Tigris and awaits Commodus's decision to kill or spare Tigris. Though Commodus votes for death (thumb down), Maximus spares Tigris, deliberately insulting the emperor and garnering the audience's approval. With his bitter enemy now known as ""Maximus the Merciful,"" Commodus becomes more frustrated at his inability to kill Maximus or stop his ascending popularity while Commodus's own popularity shrinks.Following the fight, Maximus meets his former servant Cicero (Tommy Flanagan), who reveals that Maximus's army remains loyal to him. They are camped at the port of Ostia. Lucilla, increasingly fearful of her brother's instability and incestuous desires, forms a plot with Maximus and Senator Gracchus (Derek Jacobi) to reunite Maximus with his army and overthrow Commodus. Commodus, however, learns of his sister's betrayal from her young son Lucius (Spencer Treat Clark) and forces her to reveal the plot by threatening the boy. Praetorian guards immediately storm Proximo's gladiator barracks, battling the gladiators while Maximus escapes. Hagen and Proximo are killed in the siege while Juba and the survivors are imprisoned. Maximus escapes to the city walls only to be ambushed by a cohort of Praetorian guards who use Cicero as bait, killing him as soon as Maximus comes out in the open.Concluding that legends born in the Colosseum must die there, Commodus personally challenges Maximus to a duel in front of a roaring audience. Acknowledging that Maximus's skill exceeds his own, Commodus deliberately stabs Maximus with a stiletto, puncturing his lung, and has the wound concealed beneath the gladiator's armor. In the arena, the two exchange blows before Maximus rips the sword from Commodus' hands. Commodus requests a sword from his guards, but they refuse to lend him their weapons. Maximus drops his own sword, but Commodus pulls a hidden stiletto and renews his attack. Maximus then beats Commodus into submission and kills him with his own stiletto.As Commodus collapses in the now-silent Colosseum, a dying Maximus sees his wife and son in the afterlife. He reaches for them, but is pulled back to reality by the Praetorian prefect Quintus (Tomas Arana), who asks for instructions. Maximus orders the release of Proximo's gladiators and Senator Gracchus, whom he reinstates and instructs to lead the restoration of power to the senate: as Marcus Aurelius intended, Rome will be a republic again. Maximus collapses and Lucilla rushes to his side. After being reassured that her son is safe and Commodus is dead, Maximus dies and wanders into the afterlife to his home and family in the distance. Senator Gracchus and Proximo's gladiators carry his body out of the Colosseum. That night, a newly-freed Juba buries Maximus' two small statues of his wife and son in the Colosseum (in the patch of Maximus' blood), and says that he too will eventually join them, ""but not yet."""

Magneto transfers his powers to Rogue who is forced to sit inside the machine and then start it.Logan breaks free and initiates a fight with Sabretooth. Cyclops, with Jean's help, blasts his optic rays on Sabretooth smashing him out of the statue. With Jean stabilizing him, Storm creates a storm to propel Logan to the top of Magneto's machine. With time running out, Logan attempts to stop the machine and save Rogue, but Magneto, now having regained some of his strength, halts Logan's claws. Cyclops manages to find a clean shot, wounding Magneto and allowing Logan to destroy the machine and the radiation stops short of reaching the people.Placing his hand to her face, Logan succeeds in transferring his regenerative abilities to a dying Rogue who recovers. Magneto is arrested. Professor Xavier recovers from his coma and the group finds that Mystique is still alive, now impersonating Senator Kelly.In an attempt to help Logan learn more about his past, Xavier sends him to a military base near Alkali Lake. Xavier visits Magneto in his prison, who warns that he will continue his war, to which Xavier promises that he (and the X-Men) will always be there to stop him."

The victim count increases, whilst Cindy must survive the carnage that has she has seen in so many films before.—simon Six friends - Cindy Campbell, Bobby Prinze, Buffy Gilmore, Greg Phillipe, Ray Wilkins, and Brenda Meeks - are being stalked by a serial killer. A serial killer that is after them because of an accident that they caused last Halloween. A serial killer that seems to have come out of every other scary movie. The body count has already started with Drew Decker, the local town slut, and it's starting to build up. The friends are going to have to escape from both the killer's clutches and annoying news reporter Gail Hailstorm if they plan on living to the sequel...—Will Teenager Drew Decker is home alone when she receives a phone call. The caller is persistent to find out her name, but she doesn't give in. The caller then reveals he is looking at her. Scared, Drew grabs a baseball bat and answers the front door (thinking it is the caller behind) and attacks a group of trick-or-treaters. The caller then appears in her house, dressed as Ghostface, and proceeds to chase her outside, where he rips her clothes off, which leaves her in white bra and thong. She runs into the sprinklers in her bikini; the killer catches up with her and stabs her in the breast and pulls out an implant. She runs along the road and sees her father, only to be run over by him while being distracted by her mother giving him fellatio. She is then murdered.Cindy Campbell is on her computer when her boyfriend Bobby Prinze appears in the window. Bobby is upset because his relationship with Cindy ""isn't going anywhere"" (i.e., they have not slept together). Even though he expresses this to her, she refuses and Bobby leaves.The next day in school, Cindy meets with Bobby and the rest of her friends, Brenda Meeks, Greg Phillipe, Ray Wilkins, and Buffy Gilmore. At the school, news teams are trying to interview the police and students who knew the girl who was killed the night before (her name is known as Drew Decker). The most prominent among the reporters is Gail Hailstorm, author of the recently released book You're Dead, I'm Rich. Cindy points out to the others that Drew's murder happened exactly one year after they accidentally killed a man during a night of drunk driving, and dumped his body off a pier. Greg swears the group to a pact that they will reveal what happened that night, and becomes physically abusive to Cindy when she exhibits reluctance.One class, Cindy receives a note from someone telling her that they know about the incident with the man they killed. Cindy looks outside to see the killer waving at her.After football practice, Ray and Greg are in the locker room with a bunch of other guys, and when Ray and everyone else leaves Greg for the showers (""Don't let Uncle Ray catch you!""), the latter goes off to the punching bag. After he finishes and take a shower, he finds a note tucked in the door of his locker showing a picture of his small penis. Enraged, he goes to Cindy and the others and tells them about the note, and is ridiculed for it.Buffy, competing in a beauty pageant, does a dramatic acting piece during the talent portion. During her reading, Greg is murdered by the killer in the balcony. Seeing this, Buffy attempts to warn everyone, but her desperate pleas are taken by the audience and judges as an exceptional acting performance and Buffy stops caring about Greg when she won.That night, Cindy is attacked by the killer, but she calls the cops and the killer escapes. Bobby shows up with the same gloves and knife as the killer, and is arrested. Cindy goes to stay with Buffy that night but receives a call from the real killer, which results in Bobby's release. Bobby and Cindy later bump into each other at school, but their reconciliation is awkward, stemming in part from Cindy not getting over Ginger Spice leaving the Spice Girls.The killer confronts Buffy in the girls' locker room. Making a sarcastic, meta-fictional observation about horror movie clichés, Buffy mocks the killer, even as he stabs her, and continues to do so even after he decapitates her. In order to get her to really shut up, he throws her head in the lost and found bucket.Ray and Brenda go to the movies to watch Shakespeare in Love. Ray, while in a bathroom stall, peeps in on another occupant, and is impaled through the head with a penis. The killer then attempts to kill Brenda in the auditorium, but because of her discourteous behavior, the other patrons kill her before he has a chance.During a party at her house, Cindy has sex with Bobby. At the same time, the killer shows up at Shorty's house to kill him and his friends, but gets high on marijuana with them instead. When they are rapping with each other, the killer raps and kills everyone at the same time except for Shorty, who was beside him all the time. Shorty congratulates the killer for the rap.At Cindy's house, the killer shows up and apparently stabs Bobby. As Cindy attempts to attend to Bobby's wound, Bobby shoots Shorty in the lung, causing marijuana smoke to exude. He reveals that the blood from his ""wound"" is ketchup, as he was never stabbed at all. Ray then appears, very much alive, and reveals that he and Bobby are copying the killer. When Cindy asks for a motive, Bobby points out that they don't need one, because horror movies like Scream do not boast logically coherent elements like plot or motive. Bobby also sarcastically suggests that it was lack of sex that drove him to do this, and reveals that he and Ray are gay lovers who will start a new life once they kill Cindy, a crime they will get away with because they are merely copycatting a real serial killer who actually exists. To conceal their guilt, they decide to stab one another in order so that the authorities will believe them to be victims of the real killer. As Ray stabs Bobby, Cindy yells ""You guys are psychos! You've seen one too many TV shows!"", only to have Ray respond angrily stabs Bobby to death while saying ""Watching television shows doesn't create psycho killers - canceling TV shows does! The Wayans Brothers was a good show - and we didn't even get a final episode!"" (thus breaking character, since the actor playing Ray is Shawn Wayans). However, the real killer appears shortly afterwards, stabbing Ray to death.The killer then attacks Cindy, but after she repels him, he escapes. The police show up and take Cindy to the police station, where they find out that Buffy's brother Doofy (Dave Sheridan) was actually faking his mental retardation and is the real killer,(The Usual Suspects style) and is in cahoots with Gail Hailstorm. After Doofy and Gail escape, the sheriff and Cindy find Doofy's disguise in the street and as Cindy cries out in the street over this discovery, she is run over by a passing car, while the driver is getting fellatio.During the end credits, two scenes are shown:~ Shorty talking to the audience about his plans to rob a supermarket.~ Doofy breaking up with his vacuum and making love with it."

Now, Claire reports hearing voices and witnessing eerie occurrences in and around their lakeside Vermont home, including seeing the face of a young woman reflected in water. An increasingly frightened Claire thinks the phenomena have something to do with the couple living next door, especially since the wife has disappeared without apparent explanation. At her husband's urging, Claire starts to see a therapist; she tells him she thinks the house is being haunted by a ghost. His advice? Try to make contact. Enlisting the help of her best friend, Jody, and a ouija board, Claire seeks to find out the truth of What Lies Beneath.—Eugene Kim <genekim@concentric.net> With their only daughter in college, the loving couple of Dr Norman Spencer and his spouse, Claire, a former cellist, retreat in picturesque Vermont to live a tranquil life at their serene and isolated lake house. However, their idyllic marriage will soon start falling to pieces when sensitive Claire becomes convinced that a supernatural entity has occupied their vacant home. Now, in her eyes, whispering voices and unexplained manifestations that chill the bone to the marrow grow in intensity. Could Claire's apprehensions be nothing more than figments of a vivid imagination, or is there a dreadful secret that lies deep within Norman and Claire's seemingly peaceful shelter?—Nick Riganas Norman and Claire Spencer are a seemingly happily married couple who uncover a terrible secret . . . a secret so disturbing it threatens to destroy them. When Claire Spencer begins seeing ghostly images and hearing mysterious voices in their home, her husband Norman suspects it's just her imagination - until the images turn real. Now, together they must uncover the truth, confront their worst fears and find ""what lies beneath"" . . . with twisting and terrifying results.—Robert Lynch <docrlynch@yahoo.com> Claire Spencer (Michelle Pfeiffer) moves to Vermont with her husband, renowned scientist Dr. Norman Spencer (Harrison Ford), after a serious car accident that leaves gaps in her memory. Combined with her daughter Caitlin's (Katharine Towne) departure for college, Claire is profoundly affected. Overhearing her new neighbor Mary Feur (Miranda Otto) sobbing one day, Claire is concerned, despite Norman's reassurance, and her worry increases when she sees Mary's husband Warren (James Remar) dragging what looks like a body bag out of the house in the middle of the night.Claire decides to investigate by taking a basket of flowers and wine to the house as a gift. After nobody answers the door she walks around the side of the house and discovers a woman's sandal with a dark stain on it, which she steals. Back on the doorstep, she is surprised by Warren whose surly behavior further arouses her suspicion.Mysterious events begin to occur when Claire is alone in the house pictures fall, doors open and close and Claire witnesses a shadowy reflection in bathwater. Claire is convinced that Mary is dead and haunting her. Desperate for closure, and facing little sympathy from Norman, Claire invites her best friend Jody (Diana Scarwid) to join her for a seance in her bathroom. Claire produces the sandal she had earlier taken from Mary's house and places it on the table. The Ouija board planchette (pointer) does not move, but a candle starts to flicker, then goes out. The dial on the Ouija board then starts to move slowly from M to F.Claire informs Norman of the séance, prompting him to accuse her of going crazy. Meeting Warren, Claire hysterically accuses him of killing his wife, to which Warren responds with confusion before introducing Mary to the pair.Back at the house, a picture falls off the windowsill again. Picking it up, Claire notices a newspaper clipping inside the broken frame. She discovers that it is a partial missing person report for Madison Elizabeth Frank (Amber Valletta). Reading the clipping, she realizes that Madison had been a student at the university where Norman was a lecturer. She decides to visit Madison's mother.Claire takes a lock of Madison's hair from the mother's house, and uses it to perform a ritual that allows Madison to possess her. When Norman returns home from work, Claire, who is still possessed, seduces him. While straddling Norman, Claire's face briefly morphs into that of Madison's. Frightened by the change in Claire's appearance, and by comments she has made, Norman pushes her away. This causes Claire to drop the lock of hair and break the connection with Madison. Claire's memory begins to return and she recalls that she had once caught Norman with Madison. Norman makes a confession: he had a brief relationship with Madison, but realized quickly that he loved Claire too much to leave her, causing unstable Madison to threaten to kill Claire. He then visited Madison to find her dead of an overdose with a letter to Claire. Burning the letter, he pushed Madison's car (with Madison inside) into the lake.Claire urges Norman to contact the authorities, and he agrees to do so. He speaks with the police on the phone, and then leaves to take a shower. Suspicious of her husband, Claire redials the phone and discovers that he had not really called the police. Norman suddenly grabs her from behind and sedates her. He drags her to the bathtub, which is still running, and places her in the rising water. Norman then explains to Claire that Madison was planning on going to the college's Dean about their affair, and he could not let that happen, so he killed her and pushed Madison's car and body into the lake. Expecting Claire to drown, Norman leans over her paralyzed body to give her one final kiss. While doing so, he notices that she is wearing a pendant around her neck. Realizing the pendant is on backwards, he picks up Claire's head to adjust it. Her face suddenly morphs into the corpse-like face of Madison. He is startled and jumps up against a mirror, shattering it. He then collapses and hits his head on the sink, crumpling to the floor.Claire, recovering from the sedative, crawls out of the bathtub and down the stairs. The phone has been disconnected, so she starts to drive somewhere that will have better cell phone reception, passing Norman's body as she leaves the house. Norman, only stunned, chases her and jumps into the truck when she pauses on a bridge. The truck veers off the bridge and plunges into the lake, the same lake into which Norman pushed Madison's car. Norman grabs Claire's leg so that she cannot escape, but Madison's corpse grabs Norman, drags him to the bottom of the lake, and forces him to release Claire's leg so she can float to the surface. Once Norman was drowned, Madison's corpse flashes a creepy smile, pleased that he is dead and that Claire is safe. As if that was a ghost's unfinished business.The following winter, Claire is seen placing a single red rose at the grave of Madison Elizabeth Frank, but not the grave of Norman. The camera pans out and an image of Madison's face is seen in the snow."

During an attack on a pack of Iguanodon, an egg is separated and ends up with the possession of a group of lemurs. The lemurs care for this egg and the young creature born from it, which they call Aladar (D.B. Sweeney). When meteorites hit Earth, Aladar and his family must leave their homeland. Away from home and as close to danger as they have ever been, they meet up with a huge group of dinosaurs, led by Kron (Samuel E. Wright) and Bruton (Peter Siragusa). All together they are trying to reach the nesting grounds, but it's not going to be easy.—simon Long before humans appeared on the planet, dinosaurs ruled the Earth. On a little off-coast island, a clan of lemurs finds a dinosaur egg, hatching. Since there are no parents, the lemurs take care of the newborn, Aladar (D.B. Sweeney). Years later, a medium meteorite goes down close to the island and the shockwave forces its inhabitants to flee to the continent. There, Aladar and his family meet other dinosaurs for the first time as well as real dangers. The destruction caused by the meteor here has also forced a herd of different herbivores to move to a remote valley that can provide food and protection against the carnivorous predators following after. Since Aladar grew up with a different understanding of the ways of the world, his way of helping others first isn't accepted within the herd, but soon it is proven that reason may be better than panic.—Julian Reischl <julianreischl@mac.com> This movie is set in the twilight of the dinosaurs, when the killer meteorite arrives, and deals with the legacy they leave for the emerging mammals. One dinosaur who had been raised by Lemurs becomes a sort of saurian Moses and leads the Lemurs to safety after the comet ends the age when his own kind ruled the Earth.—Paolo Costabel <paolo@bluesky-vifx.com> In a dinosaur breeding ground, a Carnotaurus triggers a stampede after being discovered by a young Parasaurolophus. An Iguanodon mother is forced to abandon her nest which is trampled by the pursuing predator. The only surviving egg is snatched by an Oviraptor, journeying on through several terrains before landing on a tropical island populated by prehistoric lemurs. Plio; the daughter of their patriarch Yar, names the hatched baby Aladar and raises him despite Yar's initial objections.Years later, a fully grown Aladar and the lemurs take part in a mating ritual, where his friend; Zini is unable to achieve a mate. Moments after the ritual ends, they are interrupted by a meteor shower and a gigantic meteoroid crashing into the Earth. The explosive blast wave destroys the island and annihilates nearly all the lemurs. Aladar, along with Plio, Yar, Zini and Suri, flee and survive by leaping across the sea towards the mainland. They look back at their ruined home and mourn for the loss of their loved ones before deciding to move on.While crossing deserted wastelands, the group are attacked by a pack of Velociraptors. After escaping from them, the family encounter a massive herd of dinosaurs led by Iguanodons; Kron the leader and his lieutenant, Bruton. The herd are on a journey to the ""Nesting Grounds"" a sanctuary left untouched by the devastation of the meteor. After the herd rest for the night, Aladar and the lemurs befriend Baylene, an elderly Brachiosaurus; her friend Eema, a Styracosaurus; and Url, her pet dog-like Ankylosaurus. The next morning, the herd reach a seemingly dried lake which they have relied on in the past. Kron orders the herd to move on until Aladar and his friends discover water trapped under the surface, thereby saving the herd from dehydration. Kron's sister Neera impressed by Aladar's compassion begins to have a relationship with him. Meanwhile, two Carnotaurus have been following the herd's tracks for days and begin stalking them for food. Bruton and a scout search for water in a canyon, but are ambushed and attacked by the Carnotaurs. Bruton manages to escape and warns Kron about the predators, panicking the entire herd. Kron picks up the pace and evacuates the herd, leaving Aladar, the lemurs and the elderly dinosaurs behind while the Carnotaurs are in pursuit some distance away.During a rainstorm, the group encounter Bruton who was left behind by Kron, before taking shelter in a cave. Shortly after, the Carnotaurus enter the cave and attack the group, but Bruton sacrifices himself by causing a cave in which kills one of them. The surviving Carnotaur leaves the cave swearing vengeance for its dead companion. Aladar and his friends escape and venture deeper, but reach a dead end. They smash through the obstacle and arrive at the Nesting Grounds on the other side. While exploring, Eema finds a large wall of boulders blocking the original entrance to the valley. Realizing that the herd will never make it over, Aladar rushes off alone to rescue them, although he is pursued by the Carnotaurus along the way. Aladar soon catches up with Kron, Neera, and the herd, suggesting a safer way to the valley, but Kron selfishly refuses. Kron loses his temper and fights Aladar, but Neera comes to the latter's aid. The herd eventually turns back against Kron and abandons him, deciding to let Aladar lead them to the Nesting Grounds instead.As they prepare to leave, Aladar, Neera, and the herd find themselves cornered by the enraged Carnotaurus. Aladar rallies Neera and the herd to stand together and they drive back against the predator. The Carnotaurus then chases after Kron, who attempts to climb over the cliff himself.

His sword, the Green Destiny, is renowned for its grace and superiority in a fight. However, Mu Bai wishes to leave the ways of the warrior behind him and asks his friend, Yu Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh) to take the sword and present it as a gift to their friend, Sir Te (Sihung Lung). Mu Bai explains that the sword holds too many memories of the past and he wishes to retire in peace. Shu Lien is a skilled warrior like Mu Bai and harbors feelings for him which he reciprocates, but does not act on due to the fact that Shu Lien was widowed by Mu Bai's best friend.At his estate, Sir Te accepts the grand gift and places it in a decorative case. Shu Lien also meets Jen (Ziyi Zhang), the daughter of a Manchurian governor, who is set for an arranged marriage. Despite her upbringing, Jen is inquisitive and seems envious of Shu Lien's status as a free warrior. That night, a thief dressed in black sneaks into Sir Te's study and steals the Green Destiny. An alarm is raised and the thief is chased over rooftops, pursued by Shu Lien, both of them demonstrating high skill in Wudang technique. The two engage in combat but the thief manages to escape.Shu Lien has her suspicions about who the thief may have been and tells Mu Bai about the theft when he arrives at Sir Te's estate. Surprised at his arrival, Shu Lien is nonetheless grateful to his help. It is implied that Mu Bai's intentions were to be close to Shu Lien. With the help of Bo (Xian Gao), Sir Te's servant, Mu Bai and Shu Lien silently investigate the theft and discover that it originated within Governor Yu's (Fazeng Li) compound and that none other than the infamous bandit, Jade Fox (Pei-Pei Cheng), is hiding out there. Mu Bai knows Fox well; she was the lover of his master who sought to learn Wudang from him. When he refused to teach her because of her status as a woman, she killed him and fled.Bo meets an undercover policeman (Deming Wang) and his daughter, May (Li Li), who have been tracking Jade Fox. Inspector Tsai explains that his wife was murdered by Fox who now hides in plain sight as Jen Yu's governess. While the three of them are conversing during the day, May and her father sharpening their weapons, a dart is shot into their quarters with a message attached to it. Jade Fox challenges them to a showdown that night. That night, they hide in the shadows of a courtyard, weapons ready, until they see a hobbling old woman crossing the courtyard. They command that she reveal herself and Jade Fox stands straight, insulting them and brandishing her own weapons. The four fight, with Bo often getting in the way as he is not a skilled fighter. Tsai and his daughter seem on the verge of defeat when Mu Bai arrives and engages Jade Fox. His attack is diverted, however, by the thief in black. Fox addresses her as her apprentice, confident now that the battle is won. Mu Bai engages the thief alone while Tsai and the others fight Fox, three to one. The thief fights Mu Bai with his own Green Destiny, but he is impressed with her skills and energy. Tsai, meanwhile, is overpowered by Fox and is killed while Bo is paralyzed with a chi-blocking attack. May mourns the loss of her father as Fox and the thief flee.The next day, Jen is told by Shu Lien that a fight occurred the night before with Jade Fox and that an undercover policeman was killed. Jen is affected by this news and it is revealed that she is the thief in black who stole the Green Destiny. Guilt-ridden, she decides to return the sword that night but is intercepted by Mu Bai who offers to become her teacher in Wudang. Jen angrily rejects his offer and leaves. Back at the governor's compound, Jen confronts Fox about killing the policeman and banishes her from her quarters. A bandit is seen scaling the rooftops and avoiding the guards set out for the governor. He sneaks into Jen's quarters and it is immediately shown that they know each other. Lo (Chang Chen) asks Jen to come away with him to the desert and a flashback reveals how they first met.Crossing the desert in a caravan, Jen watches the unchanging landscape beside her mother, holding a white hair comb. Suddenly, the caravan is attacked by a group of bandits. Jen's mother faints while she watches. A young man on a horse, Lo, appears and snatches the comb from Jens hand. Angered, Jen leaves the safety of her coach and begins to fight the bandits. Lo, impressed with her skill and anger, leads her on horseback into the desert, baiting her with the comb. They stop for water but Jen continues to fight until she knocks Lo out and collapses from the heat. When she wakes up, she finds herself in a large cave where Lo apparently lives. He allows her to bathe herself and tells her that he will sing so she always knows where he is. As he is cooking outside, Jen hits him over the head with a pot before escaping on horseback. But the desert is vast and soon the horse dies and Jen continues on foot until she collapses. She wakes up some time later, tied up and back in the cave. Lo had tracked her down and tied her up so she couldn't hit him again. But over time, they fall in love and Lo takes her to a settlement in the mountains. They notice in the distance that Jen's family is trying to locate her and Lo convinces her to return to them, saying that he would do the same for a missing daughter. He tells her the story of a man who climbed to the top of a mountain where it was rumored that, if you made a wish and then jumped off the mountain, your wish would come true. He wished for his sick family to be well again and jumped off. His wish came true and, because his heart was pure, he didn't die. Jen and Lo share an intimate moment before she leaves, giving him her comb.Back in the present, Jen refuses to leave with Lo. Heartbroken, he gives her back her comb before leaving. It's clear she is upset as well. The next day after the wedding ceremony, Lo interrupts the convoy that is carrying Jen dressed in her wedding outfit. He shouts at her, begging her to go back to the desert with him. He escapes the guards but is cornered by Mu Bai and Shu Lien. Mu Bai thinks, at first, that Lo is with Jade Fox but Shu Lien sees his innocence and takes him with them somewhere else. Lo tells them that Jen belongs to him and Shu Lien responds that getting himself killed will be no way to show his love. He must wait and they will see what they can do. Lo reluctantly agrees.Later on, the Green Destiny is missing again, along with Jen who has apparently run away. She is seen traveling on the road dressed in unassuming clothes. When she grabs the wrist of a waitress, demanding that her cup be cleaned, she draws the attention of a couple of thugs who boast about their strength and fighting abilities. Jen displays a quick and harmless display of her skills with the Green Destiny which incites the thugs to ask if she knows Li Mu Bai. She replies that he is her defeated foe. Word spreads around the inn of Jen's shady character and many of the patrons think it would be best if she left, or they will fight her. Angered, Jen unleashes her fury on the inn leaving most of it in shambles. Mu Bai and Shu Lien arrive soon after and learn of the fight.Shu Lien takes residence at a nearby Wudang temple only to be joined soon after by Jen, who affectionately calls her sister, referencing their friendship. They talk, but issues regarding the wedding and Jen's decision to run away anger her and she begins to fight Shu Lien. The fight ends when Jen wounds Shu Lien and Mu Bai appears, yelling that Jen has no right to wield the Green Destiny. Jen escapes the temple to a bamboo forest, followed by Mu Bai. After a brief chase they stop at the edge of a small waterfall where Mu Bai is able to temporarily break Jens emotional barriers, touching her gingerly on the forehead. He expresses his wish to train her again, sensing that she is confused and stubborn. She agrees to train with him only if he can take the Green Destiny from her in less than a few moves. Mu Bai does so with ease and Jen yells her frustration. Mu Bai does not believe she needs the Green Destiny and tosses it over the falls. Jen leaps off the falls and dives after the sword. Before Mu Bai can react, Jade Fox swoops in and carries Jens unconscious body away.She takes Jen to her hideout in the hills and tells her to rest and secretly places strong, smoking herbs in a jar before leaving. Jen awakens some time later, dazed, and stumbles to a flooded portion of the cave where rainwater is falling. She drinks some of the water before noticing Mu Bai entering the cave; he has followed them. Jen stumbles into his arms and he takes her back to her bed, knocking the herb jar away. He revives her and asks where Jade Fox is. Suddenly, Fox appears, screaming, and shoots a flurry of poisonous barbs towards them. Mu Bai manages to deflect them with his sword. He engages Fox sword-to-sword and eventually shreds her blade, sending the shards through her body, mortally wounding her. In her dying breaths she calls Jen a deceitful whore and tells Mu Bai that he will die just like his master. Mu Bai finds that one of the barbs has hit his neck. Jade Fox dies as Shu Lien arrives. Jen, contrite, says that she knows the antidote to the poison, but that it will take time to prepare. She leaves and Shu Lien stays with Mu Bai as he meditates to slow the effects of the poison. However, before Jen can return, Mu Bai succumbs in Shu Liens arms, professing his love for her.Jen arrives back at the cave with the antidote but discovers she's too late. She kneels before a vengeful Shu Lien who simply tells her to meet with Lo who is waiting for her in the mountains. Jen goes and is reunited with Lo, though she is unhappy. He finds her gone one morning and discovers her looking out over the side of the mountain. She asks him if he remembers the story of the man on the mountain that he told her long ago and tells him to make a wish. He wishes to return to the desert and Jen jumps off, falling gracefully through the mist. Lo cries silently as Jen disappears, a peaceful look on her face."

Their arrest is interrupted by General Salazar (Milian), a high-ranking Mexican official. The general decides to hire Javier and instructs him to locate and apprehend Frankie Flowers (Collins, Jr.) a notorious hit man for the Tijuana Obregón Drug Cartel.Meanwhile, Robert Wakefield (Douglas), a conservative Ohio Judge, is appointed to be head of the President's Office of National Drug Control, taking the title of Drug Czar. Wakefield is warned by his predecessor and several influential politicians that the war on drugs is unwinnable. Unbeknownst to Wakefield, his honor student daughter, Caroline (Christensen) is using cocaine and falls victim to drug addiction when she is introduced to freebase cocaine by her boyfriend, Seth (Grace). She and Seth are arrested when another student at her high school overdoses on drugs and they try to dump him anonymously at a nearby hospital. Robert finds out that his wife Barbara (Irving) has known about their daughter's involvement with drugs for over six months.In the third plot line, which is set in San Diego, an undercover Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) investigation led by Montel Gordon (Cheadle) and Ray Castro (Guzmán), arrest Eduardo Ruiz (Ferrer), a high-stakes dealer posing as a fisherman. In the process, Ruiz is hospitalized and decides to risk the dangerous road to immunity by giving up his boss - drug lord Carlos Ayala (Bauer), the biggest distributor for the Óbregon brothers in the United States. Ayala is charged by a tough prosecutor, hand-selected by Wakefield in an attempt to send a message to the Mexican drug organizations through a conviction against the drug lord.Flowers is tortured and eventually gives Salazar the names of several important members of the Óbregon Drug Cartel, who are arrested in a large effort by police and army soldiers. Javier and Salazar's efforts start to cripple the Óbregon brothers cocaine outfit, but Javier and Manolo discover that Salazar is a pawn for the Juárez Cartel, the rival of the Óbregon brothers. The entire Mexican anti-drug campaign is a fraud, as Salazar is wiping out one cartel, not out of duty, but rather because he has aligned himself with another cartel for profit.Wakefield realizes that his daughter is a drug addict and finds himself caught between his demanding new position and his worrisome family life. When he heads to Mexico, he is encouraged by the successful efforts of Salazar against the Óbregon brothers. When he returns to Ohio, Robert learns that his efforts to see Caroline rehabilitated have failed, and she escaped into the city and no one knows her location. Secretly, she's forced to prostitute herself and rob her parents to procure money for drugs.As the trial against Carlos Ayala begins, Carlos' pregnant wife, Helena (Zeta-Jones) learns of her husband's true profession. With her husband facing life imprisonment, and death threats against her only child, she decides to hire Flowers to assassinate Eduardo Ruiz. She knows that killing Ruiz will effectively end the trial nolle prosequi.Javier's partner, Manolo, sells information to the DEA, but is killed for his betrayal. Javier, who can no longer stomach working for Salazar, decides to cut a deal with the only non-corrupt organization he has access to - the Federal Government of the United States and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. In exchange for his testimony, Javier requests electricity in his neighborhood, so that kids can play baseball at night rather than be tempted into street gangs and crime. General Salazar's secrets are revealed to the public. He is arrested and tortured to death shortly after.Wakefield begins a search for his daughter and drags along Seth after interrupting one of his classes. After being threatened and nearly killed by Caroline's regular dealer, he follows Seth to a seedy hotel room in Cincinnati and finds a semi-conscious Caroline prostituting herself to an older man. Wakefield returns to Washington, D.C., to give his prepared speech on a ""10-point plan"" to combat the war on drugs. In the middle of the speech, he falters, then tells the press that on a war on drugs is a war against many of our own family members, which he cannot endorse. He quits his job and heads home.Flowers' assassination attempt on Ruiz fails, when he himself is assassinated for his betrayal by a sniper working for the Óbregon Cartel. Helena, knowing that Ruiz is soon to testify, then makes a deal with Juan Óbregon (Bratt), lord of the drug cartel, who forgives the debt of the Ayala family. Helena gives Óbregon the formula and procedure to turn Óbregon cocaine into harmless-looking plastic rabbit dolls that are undetectable by DEA dogs and can be shipped across the Mexico/US border. Óbregon agrees to the deal and to the stipulation that Helena's husband will be the sole distributor of Óbregon cocaine in the United States. Óbregon also agrees to have Ruiz killed.Carlos Ayala is released, much to the discomfort of Montel Gordon, who lost his partner, Castro, when Frankie tried to assassinate Ruiz with a car bomb. Ruiz is eventually given poison-laced food in his hotel room and dies. Soon after, Montel bursts into the Ayala residence and illegally plants a microphone under one of the tables, before being kicked out.Robert and Barbara begin to go to Narcotics Anonymous meetings with their daughter, to support her and everyone else there. Javier takes the media to Mexico and explains what he can about the widespread corruption in the police force and army. The film concludes with him watching some Mexican children playing baseball at night, at their new stadium."

A high school football team is forced to integrate, bringing together players from different racial backgrounds. Coach Boone, played by Denzel Washington, takes charge and helps the team overcome their differences and work together. Amidst challenges and resistance, the players learn to respect and support each other. Through hard work and determination, they become a united team, overcoming prejudice and achieving success on the field. The movie shows how sports can bring people together and promote understanding, even in the face of adversity.—Evan Almindo Suburban Virginia schools have been segregated for generations. One Black and one White high school are closed and the students sent to T.C. Williams High School under federal mandate to integrate. The year is seen through the eyes of the football team where the man hired to coach the Black school is made head coach over the highly successful white coach. Based on the actual events of 1971, the team becomes the unifying symbol for the community as the boys and the adults learn to depend on and trust each other.—LMN13 In the early 1970s, two schools in Alexandria, Virginia integrate forming T.C. Williams High School. The European American head coach of the Titans is replaced by an African American coach from North Carolina. Tensions arise when players of different races are forced together on the same football team. Many of these tensions are eased during the two-week training camp in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. When players returned to Alexandria the players found the city in turmoil due to the forced desegregation of the high school. As the season progresses the team's success caused the community to accept the changes. After the Titans' perfect season, the team and the city were closer than ever.—WSU Honors ENG 102-13 Denzel Washington playsHerman Boone, who is hired as the T.C. Williams High football coach over a white coach in Alexandria, Virginia in the early 1970's during a time when the school has just been integrated to allow blacks into the school.—Anonymous In the autumn of 1981, a group of former football coaches and players attend a funeral.Ten years earlier in July 1971, at the desegregated T. C. Williams High School in Alexandria, Virginia, a black head coach, Herman Boone, is hired to coach the school's football team. Boone is assigned to the coaching team under current coach Bill Yoast, nominated for the Virginia High School Hall of Fame. In an attempt to placate rising racial tensions and the fact that all other high schools are ""white"" only, Boone is assigned the head coach job. He refuses, believing it is unfair to Yoast, but relents after seeing what it means to the black community. Yoast is then offered an assistant coach's job by the school board and initially refuses, but reconsiders after the white players pledge to boycott the team if he does not participate. Dismayed at the prospect of the students losing their chances at scholarships, Yoast changes his mind and takes up the position of defensive coordinator under Boone, to his daughter Sheryl's dismay.The black students have a meeting in the gymnasium in auditioning to play for the team until Boone arrives, but the meeting turns into a fiasco when Yoast and white students interrupt. On August 15, the players gather and journey to Gettysburg College, where their training camp takes place. As their days of training camp progress, black and white football team members frequently clash in racially motivated conflicts, including some between captains Gerry Bertier and Julius Campbell. But after forceful coaching and rigorous athletic training by Boone, which includes an early morning run to the Gettysburg cemetery, and a motivational speech, the team achieves racial harmony and success. After returning from football camp, Boone is told by a member of the school board that if he loses even a single game, he will be dismissed. Subsequently, the Titans go through the season undefeated while battling racial prejudice, before slowly gaining support from the community. Gerry even has his best friend Ray removed from the team because of his racism, following a game where he intentionally missed a block which consequently led to the near-season-ending injury of starting quarterback Jerry ""Rev"" Harris.Just before the state semi-finals, Yoast is told by the chairman of the school board that he will be inducted into the Hall of Fame after the Titans lose one game, implying he wants Boone to be dismissed over his race. During the game, it becomes apparent that the referees are biased against the Titans. Upon seeing the chairman and other board members in the audience looking on with satisfaction, Yoast realizes that they've rigged the game and warns the head official that he will go to the press and expose the scandal unless the game is officiated fairly. The Titans nonetheless win and advance to the state championship, but Yoast is told by the chairman that his actions have resulted in his loss of candidacy for Hall of Fame induction.While celebrating the victory, Bertier is severely injured in a car accident with a truck after driving through an intersection. Although Bertier is unable to play due to being paralyzed from the waist down, the team goes on to win the state championship. Bertier would remain a paraplegic for the rest of his life.Ten years later, Bertier dies in another automobile accident caused by a drunk driver, after winning the gold medal in shot put in the Paralympic Games; it is then revealed that it is his funeral the former football coaches and players are attending.In the epilogue, descriptions show the players' and coaches' activities after the events in 1971."
The Patriot,2000,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0187393/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Peaceful farmer Benjamin Martin is driven to lead the Colonial Militia during the American Revolution when a sadistic British officer murders his son. It is 1776 in colonial South Carolina. Benjamin Martin, a French-Indian war hero who is haunted by his past, now wants nothing more than to live peacefully on his small plantation, and wants no part of a war with the most powerful nation in the world, Great Britain. Meanwhile, his two eldest sons, Gabriel and Thomas, can't wait to enlist in the newly formed ""Continental Army."" When South Carolina decides to join the rebellion against England, Gabriel immediately signs up to fight...without his father's permission. But when Colonel William Tavington, British dragoon, infamous for his brutal tactics, comes and burns the Martin Plantation to the ground, tragedy strikes. Benjamin quickly finds himself torn between protecting his family, and seeking revenge along with being a part of the birth of a new, young, and ambitious nation.—Caleb Conser After proving himself on the field of battle in the French and Indian War, Benjamin Martin wants nothing more to do with such things, preferring the simple life of a farmer. But when his son Gabriel enlists in the army to defend their new nation, America, against the British, Benjamin reluctantly returns to his old life to protect his son, now serving under his command, and his family from British tyranny.—Anonymous Ashamed of his savagery during the French and Indian War, Benjamin Martin decided he would sit out the American Revolution, while his oldest son Gabriel enlisted minutes after South Carolina joined the fight. He changes his mind when his house is burned down and one of his children is killed by the savage Green Dragoon commander Colonel Tavington. Quickly realizing that traditional 18th century warfare tactics won't work, Martin organizes militiamen into a guerilla unit to harass Cornwallis' army long enough to allow the French to arrive.—Jeff Cross <blackjac_1998@yahoo.com> Benjamin Martin is a South Carolina planter who is still haunted by his notoriously brutal past as a soldier in the French and Indian War.

But when the British Colonel Tavington threatens their welfare and kills one of his sons, he chooses to enlist. Martin becomes the leader of a makeshift militia, which consists of peasants, slaves, a minister, and assorted other irregulars. During the war Martin and his men discover that they will pay a steep personal price for their rebellion. But thanks to their courage and bravery, they are also destined to pay a pivotal role in turning the tide against the Redcoats.—<jgp3553@excite.com> Benjamin Martin (Mel Gibson), a veteran of the 1754-1760 French and Indian War, is a widower raising his seven children (five sons and two daughters) on his farm in South Carolina. He manages his land with free servants and employs in carpentry, particularly fashioning rocking chairs, though he has little success with it.His eldest son, Gabriel (Heath Ledger), is keenly interested in the fighting between the American colonies and the British; the Revolutionary War has been waged in other colonies for some time, though Benjamin does not share his enthusiasm in war. When word comes in that a congress is being held in Charleston regarding the war, Gabriel and his brother Thomas (Gregory Smith) eagerly accompany their father. While there, it is voted that South Carolina join the war against the British despite Benjamin's advice against it. Being of age, Gabriel enlists in the Continental army without his father's permission. Colonel Harry Burwell (Chris Cooper), a friend and ally of Benjamin's, regards Gabriel's similarities to his father and promises to watch out for him. The war wages on for two more years and Gabriel writes letters to his family throughout, expressing the horrors of war he's witnessed. At home, Thomas is found by Benjamin, trying on a red coat stored away in his father's war chest, and expresses his desire to join the army. Though Benjamin refuses to let him join, he relents that Thomas may enlist when he's seventeen in two years.One night, gunfire erupts outside the Martin home and the family watches as a battle ensues just beyond their property. A lone and wounded soldier enters the home. As Benjamin draws a pistol to the stranger, it is revealed to be Gabriel, en route to deliver dispatches. Benjamin gives him care, and to the rest of the wounded soldiers, both Continental and British, through the night into morning. The porch is used as a makeshift ward and Benjamin receives praise from a British lieutenant (Grahame Wood) before a cavalry of British Dragoons, led by Colonel William Tavington (Jason Isaacs), arrives. Tavington is given the discovered dispatches and orders the identity of the carrier. Gabriel turns himself in, hoping to spare his family any punishment, but Tavington orders that the wounded Continental troops be killed and the house burned for having harbored the enemy. Benjamin begs lenience but is silenced as Gabriel is led away. Impatient, Thomas runs forward and tries to free Gabriel but is ruthlessly shot by Tavington. Thomas dies in his father's arms as Tavington insults him and rides off. His soldiers set the house on fire while Gabriel is led away on a separate convoy and the home servants, including housekeeper Abigail (Beatrice Bush) are forced into British service.Enraged, Benjamin goes back into the burning house and grabs his collection of rifles and ammo from his war chest along with a tomahawk. He returns to his remaining children and instructs his daughters, Margaret (Mika Boorem) and Susan (Skye McCole Bartusiak) , and his youngest son William (Logan Lerman) to hide in the fields before making their way to their aunt's come nightfall. He then gives rifles to his older sons, Nathan (Trevor Morgan) and Samuel (Bryan Chafin) , and tells them to come with him. They make their way through the forest, arriving on a ridge ahead of the British convoy with the intent to ambush them. He tells his sons to start by shooting the officers and work their way down through the British ranks and to remember what he taught them about marksmanship. As the convoy passes, Benjamin and his sons alternate gunfire, creating confusion and chaos in the British ranks. The soldiers are quickly killed off and Benjamin shows ferocious brutality when he takes his tomahawk vengefully to one of the British privates. Gabriel is freed and they reunite with the rest of the family at Charlotte Shelton's (Joely Richardson) plantation, the sister of Benjamin's late wife. Young Samuel goes to bed distraught over the events of the day but Nathan tells his father he was glad to kill the British soldiers.A solitary survivor of the convoy attack is brought to Tavington. The man gives his testimony and explains that it seemed that just one man was responsible for the attack, proclaiming him as a 'ghost' of some kind. Tavington is skeptical but surprised that such a thing could happen.Gabriel decides to rejoin the Continentals, stating his decision as the duty of a soldier, and Benjamin decides, with hesitation, to accompany him. They leave the children with Charlotte and later witness a battle in an open field behind the home of fleeing colonists. Benjamin explains to Gabriel that the form of set-piece warfare (opponents directly facing each other and taking turns firing) is barbaric and that this particular battle was over before it began. They meet up with Colonel Burwell who asks Benjamin to organize a militia to keep General Charles Cornwallis (Tom Wilkinson) at bay in the south before French navy reinforcements arrive. Benjamin and Gabriel split up. Gabriel travels to a quaint town and is reunited with a childhood flame, Anne Howard (Lisa Brenner). He speaks to the townspeople within their church and, with Anne's patriotic encouragement, manages to enlist many, including local Dan Scott (Donal Logue) and Reverend Oliver (Rene Auberjonois). Before leaving, he asks permission of Anne's father, Peter Howard (Joey D. Vieira), to write to her. Though her father is mostly deaf, she helps Gabriel get permission.Benjamin rides with French officer Jean Villeneuve (Tchéky Karyo) to a shady colonist bar where Ben proves the potential of the supposed drunkards by proclaiming 'God save King George!' and receiving violent reaction. Among the enlistees is John Billings (Leon Rippy), an old friend of Ben's whose young son shares his contempt for 'redcoats'. John jokes with Ben, saying that rumors have spread of a tomahawk-wielding ghost wreaking havoc on British soldiers. The moniker sticks. Over the next few months, Villeneuve assists with the training of the militia using guerrilla fighting tactics and they plunder and harass British convoys and supply lines. One such capture yields valuable information meant to be delivered to Cornwallis himself, including a personal diary and his prized Great Danes. Cornwallis is greatly frustrated with the failure to capture the 'ghost' and his militia and blames Tavington for his callous cruelty, having spawned the creation of the 'ghost' in the first place. As he attends a lavish party, a supply ship in the bay outside his plantation explodes in a brilliant display while Benjamin and his men row away disguised as redcoats, having stolen all the luxuries on board.Benjamin and Gabriel visit Anne's hometown where Gabriel calls on her and spends the night, sewn by Anne's mother (Mary Jo Deschanel) into a traditional bundling bag, meant to allow courtship but deter intimacy. Upon leaving the next morning, Gabriel's teeth are stained black from ink poured into his tea; payback from Anne for a childhood prank, however her teeth are equally stained after she kisses Gabriel goodbye. Benjamin and his men set up a roadblock and prepare to ambush an approaching supply wagon train. He calls out his militia hiding in the fields to intimidate the British soldiers from retaliating, but the wagon covers are pulled back and more soldiers emerge. When Benjamin notices Tavington's cavalry approaching, he fires at the convoy and orders his men to retreat. Some men are killed outright and Dan Scott is injured. A slave promised freedom for fighting with the colonists, Occam (Jay Arlen Jones), stops to help Dan, despite the fact that Dan was against the promise of freedom to slaves who fought. Benjamin and Gabriel barely escape into the forest as the rest of the surviving militia are either killed or captured upon surrender.The remaining militia fall back to an abandoned stone chapel in the swamp. Gabriel speaks to Benjamin as he melts pewter toy soldiers that once belonged to Thomas, molding them into bullets for his sidearm. Gabriel asks what truly happened at Fort William Henry, the assault of which Benjamin was involved in but never openly told to his children. Benjamin tells of how, in retaliation for what the French-led Indians did to the British, he and other men engaged in guerrilla warfare against them, taking fierce revenge, slaughtering men, women and children. It was something that Benjamin regretted for years afterwards because of its brutality. Gabriel assures Benjamin that, while he still wants revenge for what happened to Thomas, it would be best to stay the course and keep fighting on level ground. They are interrupted as Occum and Dan emerge from the swamps. Occum tells of how the captured militia are to be hanged for treason and Benjamin comes up with a plan. He requests parlay to meet with Cornwallis at the fort where the militia is being held and rides out with his Great Danes. Cornwallis is pleased to see his dogs and thanks Benjamin for caring for them, but is reluctant to give up his prisoners of war. However, he is forced to free them when Benjamin reveals he is holding several British soldiers of high rank captive, their red uniforms barely visible on a distant hill. On his way out, he meets Tavington. O'Hara tells Tavington that Martin is the ""ghost"" he's been looking for. Tavington taunts him, asking about Martin's son Thomas. Martin faces Tavington and calmly promises to kill him before the war is over. Tavington confronts Cornwallis about the exchange of prisoners but is rebuffed and scolded for his otherwise unconventional tactics in war. Benjamin leaves with his men and, with a whistle, the Great Danes as well, now loyal to him. Cornwallis is, however, resigned to Tavington's crueler methods when O'Hara (Adam Baldwin) walks in with one of the redcoat captives; nothing more than a scarecrow.Cornwallis authorizes Tavington to issue harsher methods of intimidation against the militia. Tavington decides to track down the families of the militia and rides out to Charlotte's plantation, burning it to the ground. She and the children, however, manage to escape and find refuge at a beach colony inhabited by former slaves. There, they are reunited with Abigail. Benjamin and Gabriel arrive some time later, as do Anne's family. Gabriel proposes and the two are married. Benjamin gives Anne his late wife's necklace which has a talisman of Polaris, the north star. He explains that the star is a symbol of unwavering strength and serves as a constant guide. Benjamin begins to bond with Charlotte, having grown feelings for her and, when he and Gabriel prepare to leave, shares a tender moment with his youngest child, Susan, who speaks to him for the first time since her mother's death.Anne and her family return to their hometown after the wedding while Gabriel moves on with his father and the rest of the militia. There, they find that the town has been taken control of by Tavington's cavalry and are forced into the church with the rest of the townspeople. Tavington orders the doors and windows barred and the church to be burned. A stunned Wilkins reluctantly does so and the cavalry leaves. Anne and her family are left to die.Arriving in town elsewhere, Benjamin and his men discover that many of the townsfolk have been brutally murdered. John Billings finds his wife and young son dead in the street and, overwhelmed, puts a pistol to his head. Benjamin allows his men to go check on their families with the assurance that, if they do not return to the swamp chapel, they will not be deemed cowards. Gabriel rides with Benjamin to check on Anne and find the town empty and the church destroyed. Benjamin notes the chains on the charred doors and, upon looking through the rubble, finds the star necklace he had given Anne lying in the ashes. Burwell appears behind him and tells him that Gabriel is gone. Taking only a few men with him, Gabriel rides after Tavington's men and catches them off guard as Tavington shaves in a creek. All of the men, British and militia, are killed until Reverend Oliver takes aim at Tavington who shoots him. His rifle still loaded, Oliver tosses it to Gabriel before collapsing and Gabriel shoots at Tavington, knocking him down. Filled with rage and bent on revenge, Gabriel takes a knife and leans over Tavington's body. Tavington, however, rolls over and stabs Gabriel through with his sabre; Gabriel's shot had missed. Tavington flees, leaving Gabriel moaning in the grass, as Benjamin and other men arrive. Gabriel apologizes for Thomas before dying in Benjamin's arms. Benjamin tries to assure his son that Thomas' death was not his fault.Benjamin mourns Gabriel's passing, watching over his body in a tent in a Continental encampment. Burwell tries to console him and encourage him to keep fighting, but Benjamin's spirit is broken and he fears that his past sins have finally caught up to him. Villeneuve berates Benjamin's resignation and tells him of how he watched as his wife and two daughters were strung up on a ship overrun by British soldiers and burned alive.The Continentals leave Benjamin and continue to their next decisive battle at Cowpens. However, they soon spot Benjamin riding forward to meet them, carrying an American flag; he has promised himself to stay the course as Gabriel once told him. Together, the Continentals and the militia fight against the British at Cowpens and prove to be a formidable force. Watching the battle from afar, Tavington is impatient and decides, against Cornwallis' express order, to charge forth with his Dragoons. Benjamin rallies the militia to push forward and soon faces off with Tavington, dueling fiercely until Tavington manages to wound Benjamin, forcing him to the ground. As he is about to behead Benjamin, Tavington berates him for wanting to kill him before war's end. ""It appears you are not the better man,"" he says and lunges, but Benjamin ducks, grabs hold of a bayonet-fitted musket at the last moment and stabs Tavington through the gut. As Tavington lies on the ground, stunned, Benjamin takes a broken bayonet and replies, ""You're right...my sons were better men."" before stabbing him through the neck.General Cornwallis sounds the retreat of his forces and the rebels celebrate. In voiceover, Benjamin tells of how the British were defeated later that year at the Siege of Yorktown in 1781. The French navy finally arrived to blockade the British and Cornwallis was bombarded by both the Continentals and the French, holed up in his mansion. He finally acknowledges defeat and surrenders, saying ""Everything will change...everything has changed."" Benjamin returns to his family and greets a freed Occum at a site where new homes are to be built, starting with the Martins'."

Instead, Rocky puts them through a set of exercises that seem to have no purpose while assuring them that all the chickens are making progress.Meanwhile, a large machine arrives; Mr. Tweedy begins assembling it. At the same time, Mrs. Tweedy orders food rations doubled. Ginger unwisely proclaims that her intent is to fatten them up for something, causing a panic. However, the machine is now complete, and Mr. Tweedy kidnaps Ginger for its first test. Rocky follows Ginger into the machine and rescues her, sabotaging the machine and giving them more time to work on their escape. Fowler, an older rooster, gives Rocky his respect for rescuing Ginger and his old Royal Air Force (RAF) badge in tribute. Rocky decides to flee the farm the next day, leaving behind Fowler's medal and the second half of the poster, showing that he was a stunt rooster, only ""flying"" by being shot out of a cannon.This revelation outrages the other chickens, and a fight soon breaks out as morale falls. When Fowler arrives to restore order, he begins talking of his days in the RAF, leading Ginger to realize that she and the other chickens can build a plane made from Fowler's pictures and personal recollections. The chickens race against time to assemble their plane as Mr. Tweedy works to repair the pie machine.The chickens finally finish their plane just as Mr. Tweedy completes the repairs of the pie machine and enters the coop to grab all the chickens. The chickens launch an open revolt, tying up and gagging Mr. Tweedy and readying the ""crate"". As the chickens start to take off, Mr. Tweedy gets free and knocks down the ramp. Ginger jumps down while Fowler turns the plane around, knocking Mr. Tweedy unconscious. As Ginger struggles to lift the ramp, Mrs. Tweedy arrives with an ax and attacks Ginger.However, Rocky, having had a change of heart, flies over the fence and hits Mrs. Tweedy in her face aboard a tricycle. Rocky and Ginger grab onto a string of lights caught on the plane's landing gear; Mrs. Tweedy awakens, and grabs onto the lights, weighing down the crate. Ginger heads down the string to cut it, but loses the scissors. Realizing the only way to cut the lights, Ginger tricks Mrs. Tweedy by using the hatchet to sever the string. Mrs. Tweedy falls, crashing into the pie machine and plugging her into the safety valve. This causes the machine to explode, destroying the barn and covering most of the farm with gravy.The film ends as the chickens find an idyllic setting in a bird sanctuary, where they can live in comfort and raise their new chicks. Rocky and Ginger, having fallen in love with each other, become a couple. Meanwhile, Nick and Fetcher discuss their plans of starting their own chicken farm, so they can have all the eggs they could eat. Ultimately, though, they end up arguing with each other over whether the chicken or the egg came first."
Miss Congeniality,2000,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0212346/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"An F.B.I. Agent must go undercover in the Miss United States beauty pageant to prevent a group from bombing the event. Undercover F.B.I. Agent Gracie Hart shows no signs of having any femininity in her demeanor or appearance. Generally a bright and capable Agent, she is in trouble at work when she makes an error in judgment in a case which results in a near disaster. As such, one of her by-the-books colleagues, Eric Matthews, who has never shown any inclination of thinking outside the box, is assigned to lead the high profile case of a terrorist coined The Citizen instead of her, while she is facing possible disciplinary action. Gracie pieces together the evidence to determine that The Citizen's next target will be the Miss United States beauty pageant. The pageant represents everything that Gracie abhors. Despite Gracie's mannish demeanor, Eric, with no other undercover female Agent remotely fitting the demographic, assigns her to go undercover as a pageant contestant to see if she can flush out The Citizen, who is perhaps one of the other contestants. Although the pageant administration, led by former winner Cathy Morningside and long time host Stan Fields, provide the F.B.I. with access to the pageant, Cathy in particular is less than thrilled to have a non-credible Gracie posing as a contestant, which she feels will ruin the pageant. The F.B.I. enlist the assistance of former pageant contestant coach Victor Melling, who is facing his own disgrace associated with the pageant, to do the nearly impossible task of transforming Gracie, not only into a woman, but a credible beauty pageant contestant. As Gracie proceeds in the transformation, she gets to know the other contestants, not only as potential criminals, but also as real people. She also discovers that another sinister element is present at the pageant. She will do whatever it takes to quash that element and protect her new friends, namely the other innocent contestants. But now displaying some femininity, Gracie begins to have more womanly feelings, and in turn, attracts the attention of men, one in particular about whom she is happy.—Huggo When a serial killer indicates that his next target is the Miss United States beauty pageant, the F.B.I. decides that they must get an undercover Agent as a participant in the contest. A search uncovers no suitable candidate other than a bumbling female Agent. Reluctantly, her Captain agrees to let her join the team working the case. The team is led by a womanizing Agent who has an apparent reluctant attraction to Bullock's character. She enters as Miss New Jersey, replacing a contestant who was discovered to have acted in a porn movie. The pageant managers are immediately aghast about the Agent appearing in the pageant, but arrange a top handler to come give her a quick make-over, with the expected outstanding results. Unfortunately, she still is bumbling. When the killer is suddenly caught, everything seems to be over, except the female Agent tries to convince her boss that something is still not right. She has discovered that the pageant managers are being dismissed after twenty-one years for younger people, and Bergen's character may not be as solid as she seems on the surface.—John Sacksteder <jsackste@bellsouth.net> The film opens in 1982 at a school where one boy is bullying another. We see Gracie Hart as a child (Mary Ashleigh Green) who steps in to the fight, beats up the bully and tries to help the victim, whom she likes. However, the boy feels humiliated about being rescued ""by a girl"" and rudely rejects her. She responds by punching the boy in the nose, then leaves to sulk alone.Many years later, Gracie Hart (Sandra Bullock) is a tough Special Agent working for the Federal Bureau of Investigation with Eric Matthews (Benjamin Bratt). In a sting operation against Russian mobsters, she disobeys the orders of her superior (Ernie Hudson) and tries to stop their target, a mob boss, from choking. Because of her actions one of her squad gets shot. As punishment, she is demoted to a desk job.The agency is soon alerted to a threat against the 75th annual Miss United States beauty pageant in San Antonio, Texas by a letter from a notorious domestic terrorist known only as ""The Citizen"". Eric is elected to lead the mission to stop a supposed attack. Eric relies on Gracie's suggestions, but ends up taking credit for them himself. One of Gracie's ideas is to plant an undercover agent at the event. A computer search identifies Gracie as the female FBI agent best qualified to take the role, and the cover for her is to be a replacement for Miss New Jersey, as the original would have been disqualified after she was discovered to have been in a porn film, although Gracie pays little attention to her femininity.Beauty pageant coach Victor Melling (Michael Caine), whose reputation was ruined after his last contestant criticized his methods, teaches the tomboyish Gracie how to dress, walk, and act like a contestant. She is unused to such behavior, however, and sees the pageant and its participants as ""outdated and anti-feminist"", but despite being appalled at first, she comes to appreciate Victor's thoroughness. Gracie enters the pageant as ""Gracie Lou Freebush"", representing New Jersey, and soon becomes an unexpected friend of Cheryl Frasier (Heather Burns), who is Miss Rhode Island. As the pageant begins, Gracie impresses the audience and judges during the talent competition by playing the glass harp and demonstrating self-defense techniques, when the other girls drink out of the glass harp.Several suspects are identified, including competition director and former pageant winner Kathy Morningside (Candice Bergen), her unpleasant assistant Frank Tobin (Steve Monroe), veteran MC Stan Fields (William Shatner) and Cheryl, who has a history of being a radical animal rights activist. Gracie tries to dig into Cheryl's past when she accompanies her to a party with the other contestants, but inadvertently finds out that Kathy's past as a pageant contestant is suspect when she learns about a previous contest that Kathy won after the contest's leader suddenly came down with food poisoning. Gracie comes to think that Kathy may actually be a copycat of ""The Citizen"", but when she reports these suspicions to Eric and the rest of the team, she finds out that ""The Citizen"" has been arrested elsewhere on an unrelated charge. With no further threat identified, the supervisor has pulled the mission, but Gracie still suspects that something is wrong, and turns in her badge and gun in order to continue the pageant investigation alone. Just as Eric is about to board the plane back to the Bureau, he receives information that appears to confirm Gracie's suspicions, and disobeys orders by returning to San Antonio to help her continue the investigation.In the pageant's final round, Gracie surprises everyone, including herself, by being named first runner-up, while Cheryl is crowned as Miss United States, but as she goes to collect the winner's tiara, Gracie realizes that Frank, who is actually Kathy's son, impersonated ""The Citizen"" when he made the bomb threat against the pageant. Gracie tries to tell Victor, but he just brightens her remarks up and doesn't take her seriously. She next tries constantly to whisper her findings to Eric as she gets up on the stage, but he too is unable to grasp her statements. She then grabs the tiara off Cheryl and throws it up toward the stage's scenery, where it explodes. As Kathy and Frank are both arrested, Gracie determines that they had wanted to kill the winner of the pageant on stage as an act of revenge for Kathy being terminated from the Miss United States organization. That night, Gracie and Eric both make preparations to return to headquarters with a new-found interest in each other. At the post-pageant breakfast the next morning, the contestants name Gracie as ""Miss Congeniality""."

In exchange for his little brother's life, the reformed car thief, Randall ""Memphis"" Raines, has to do the impossible: in less than three days, he has to steal not one, but fifty exotic supercars for the ruthless crime lord, Ray Calitri. To stand a chance of pulling off this intricate and time-sensitive grand theft auto, once more, Memphis has to rely on his old gang--his knowledgeable mentor, Otto; the old friends, Sphinx and Donny; his reluctant ex-girlfriend, Sway, and a band of tech-savvy young thieves--however, the police are already onto them. Now, fast Lamborghinis, precious Ferraris, luxurious Porsches, and Eleanor--a rare Ford Shelby Mustang GT500--are just some of the cars in Raines' long list. Can Memphis execute the perfect car heist?—Nick Riganas Car theft in Long Beach went down 47% when Randall ""Memphis"" Raines walked away from the life. He gets dragged back into it by assuming the job his brother Kip screwed up for stolen-car broker Raymond Calitri: steal 50 exotic cars and have them on a container ship by 8 AM Friday morning, and he got this news on a Monday. With Calitri threatening to kill him and Kip, and the police GRAB unit breathing down his neck, Memphis reassembles his old crew and attempts to pull off the logistically impossible.—Jeff Cross <blackjac_1998@yahoo.com> Memphis Raines must return to the world of auto theft after his brother breaches a contract with a Russian crime lord to deliver high end cars. Memphis must get a gang together for a one night 'boost' to grab all the cars while avoiding apprehension by the auto theft cop who trailed him years before.—FMJ_Joker Kip Raines, a young car thief, was contracted to steal 50 specific cars but something went wrong. Now the man who hired him, Raymond Calitri, wants his head. When his brother, Memphis, once a great car thief, who retired a few years ago, learns of this, he comes back to town to see if he can help his brother. The only thing that will appease Calitri is if the order is fulfilled. So Memphis has to assemble his old crew, and he has to do the job in a few days. And a cop who hounded him, upon learning of his return, is keeping an eye on him. And another car thief, whom he competed with before wants to get the Calitri job, and is telling Memphis to back off, but he won't.—rcs0411@yahoo.com Randall ""Memphis"" Raines, a notorious Los Angeles car thief, has left his life of crime behind him and gone straight, teaching Go-Kart Racing for kids in Central California. His younger brother, Kip Raines, has nevertheless followed in his footsteps and is in the midst of stealing 50 high-end cars for a British gangster, Raymond Calitri. One night after stealing a Porsche, Kip spies a beautiful woman in the passenger seat of another car, and to impress her, challenges her date to a race. This chase attracts the attention of the police, who follow Kip to the warehouse where the stolen cars are being stored. Kip and his gang flee from the police in time, but the boost is ruined, the cars are impounded and Calitri is infuriated.Calitri kidnaps Kip. Atley Jackson, Memphis' long-time friend, takes him to see Calitri, who threatens to kill Kip and Memphis if they don't steal the required 50 cars in three days, when they are due on a ship headed to South America. With no choice but to steal the cars, Memphis gathers a rag-tag crew of car thieves including Atley, autobody shop owner Otto Halliwell, DMV employee Donny Astricky, a mute mortician known as The Sphinx, and Memphis' ex-girlfriend, mechanic/bartender Sara ""Sway"" Wayland. Kip insists on helping with his young crew members Tumbler, Mirror Man, Freb, and Toby. They use Otto's shop as headquarters for the heist, and Toby hacks the DMV database to locate the cars on the list, which are all given female nicknames. The last car on the list, dubbed Eleanor, is a customized 1967 Mustang GT that has repeatedly brought trouble for Memphis.LAPD Detectives Castlebeck and Drycoff of the Governor's Regional Auto Theft Bureau investigate the case. At the abandoned warehouse, Castlebeck notices mysterious shattered glass. They hear Memphis is back in town and pay him a visit, but he claims he is merely visiting for a family emergency and will soon be leaving. The detectives remain suspicious. The three Mercedes impounded by the police all require laser-cut keys, which are impossible to clone. Drycoff discovers that all were purchased from a Newport dealer, Dressner Foreign Motors, which has only one ex-con working there, who happens to handle replacing lost keys from the manufacturer in Germany. They confront him and threaten to arrest him for grand theft auto unless he cooperates. He agrees to contact them if the person who paid him for the replacement keys returns, which he does, as they predict.The police set up surveillance on the three Mercedes. While parked in a minivan four doors down, Castlebeck and Drycoff spot the Raines brothers, who just take photos of the Mercedes in the driveway. The Raines brothers are accosted by some gang members who accused Memphis of stealing the job from Calitri. The brothers take shelter in a diner, where members of the California Highway Patrol are eating. Memphis distracts a truck driver while Kip chains his truck to the gang members' chassis. When he drives away, he pulls their car apart and they pull their weapons. The CHiPS run out and arrest the gang members for illegal guns.Freb, eager to prove himself, steals a 1983 Cadillac Eldorado when he spots it in a bad neighborhood with the keys left inside. Unfortunately, it turns out to be a car used by drug dealers and contains heroin in the trunk. Before they can get rid of the car, Castlebeck arrives at Otto's shop. He remarks that the other cars in the shop are classics and questions why anybody would invest money to restore an '83 Eldorado. While calling to check if the car had been reported stolen, Castlebeck notices that the call signs of the police units working that night are written down, indicating when their second heist is happening. Memphis is worried, realizing the police are breathing down their necks.The heist begins smoothly, and one by one, the cars are stolen and driven to the Long Beach Naval Shipyard, where they are immediately hidden in containers to be loaded onto the cargo ship. Castlebeck and Drycoff continue their surveillance on the three Mercedes and return to the parked minivan in the neighborhood, four houses down from the Mercedes. But they are forced to improvise when another minivan parks in the driveway next to them, blocking their view of the Mercedes, and they park their car closer. When Memphis arrives, he stops just before he opens the car door when he realizes the minivan from the photos is now two doors down, not four.Memphis calls Astricky, about to steal another Mercedes from outside the casino, and tells him the Mercedes are under surveillance. The whole deal will be off if they do not have every single car on the list. As they still have the replacement keys from the Mercedes impounded by the police, they decide to steal the cars from the police impound lot. Mirror Man causes a distraction and they successfully steal the three Mercedes.Detectives Castlebeck and Drycoff are told by a coworker from the Homicide Unit to back off Calitri, as he is under investigation for murder. A despondent Castlebeck receives a report from the lab about the shattered glass, identifying it as a black light. He and Drycoff go to the abandoned warehouse with functional black lights and discover the original list of cars. Knowing Memphis' past with Eleanor, Castlebeck realizes that the 1967 Mustang will be last on the list and their best chance for catching him in the act.Defying Memphis' orders not to deviate from the exact plan, Toby follows Kip and Tumbler to a suburban home where they plan to steal a Cadillac Escalade. Toby wanders outside the garage and is spotted by a young woman, who raises the alarm that the car is being stolen. A private security guard pursues them and fires at the SUV, wounding Toby. Atley takes Toby to a shady doctor he knows, who saves his life, no questions asked.Castlebeck and Drycoff arrive just as Memphis is boosting Eleanor, and begin a long pursuit through Long Beach. He manages to evade the police and arrives with a very beat up Eleanor shortly after the deadline of 8 p.m. Calitri refuses to take the car and instead orders his henchmen to kill Memphis, whose life is saved at the last minute by Kip and Atley.Memphis goes after Calitri and pursues him in a large warehouse at the Navy Yard, where Castlebeck and Drycoff join the pursuit, guns drawn. When Calitri corners Castlebeck and is about to kill him, Memphis arrives and saves Castlebeck's life by kicking Calitri, who falls over the railing several stories to his death. In gratitude, Castlebeck allows Memphis to leave, but first Memphis tells him where he can find the 49 boosted cars in the yard.Later, the gang gathers to celebrate with a barbecue at Otto's shop, where Kip presents Memphis with an old, rusted out ""Eleanor"" awaiting to be refurbished."
Unbreakable,2000,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0217869/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A man learns something extraordinary about himself after a devastating accident. David Dunn (Willis) is taking a train from New York City back home to Philadelphia after a job interview that didn't go well when his car jumps the tracks and collides with an oncoming engine, with David the only survivor among the 131 passengers on board. Astoundingly, David is not only alive, he hardly seems to have been touched. As David wonders what has happened to him and why he was able to walk away, he encounters a mysterious stranger, Elijah Prince (Samuel L. Jackson), who explains to David that there are a certain number of people who are ""unbreakable"" -- they have remarkable endurance and courage, a predisposition toward dangerous behavior, and feel invincible but also have strange premonitions of terrible events. Is David ""unbreakable""? And if he is, what are the physical and psychological ramifications of this knowledge? Engulfed in perpetual sadness, David Dunn--a former football player and now a security guard with an unsuccessful marriage--emerges unscathed from a devastating train crash that claimed the lives of 131 passengers. Before long, Dunn's polar opposite--the brittle-boned comic-book art dealer, Elijah Price--approaches the tragedy's sole survivor, utterly convinced that luck had nothing to do with his miraculous survival. The mysterious stranger has a preposterous theory which explains the condition of the man whose bones never break. However, do life's antitheses define one's destiny? Above all--if there's a connection between Price and Dunn--is David, indeed, ""unbreakable""?—Nick Riganas Security Guard David Dunn miraculously survives a catastrophic train crash outside Philadelphia. Not only is he the sole survivor out of 132 passengers, he also is completely unharmed. A little later, comic book specialist Elijah Price contacts him to confront David with an incredible theory: Elijah, who has been nicknamed ""Mr. Glass"" due to his more than fragile bones, thinks that David has got all which he himself lacks. The two of them ""seem to be linked by a curve, but sitting on opposite ends"". First, David does not believe the strange man, but every single thing he had said proves to be true: David has never ever been hurt or sick in his life, his physical strength is larger than normal and he has a skill which others don't. Slowly, David begins to discover the shocking truth behind Mr. Price's assumptions. But after all, David's fate is not only to find his real place in the world. It also is about proving Elijah's theory of his own existence.—Julian Reischl <julianreischl@mac.com> David Dunn's marriage is crumbling, and he's thinking of moving to New York. Then when he's coming home from a job interview, his train derails and he is the only survivor. More than that, he doesn't have a scratch on him. David is contacted by Elijah Price, who runs a comic book art gallery and suffers from a genetic condition that makes his bones very easy to break. Elijah has been a comic book fan all his life, and has developed a theory that they are what remains of an ancient system of storytelling, and the superheroes they are about are based on real people. Elijah believes David may be one of these people. He has hardly ever been injured or sick, and he has tremendous strength, plus an uncanny ability to tell if someone is about to or has done something bad. David doesn't know what to think about the theory, or Elijah himself. However, events soon conspire to convince him he may be a superhero after all.—rmlohner The film opens as we see a baby being born in west Philadelphia. This is Elijah Price. Elijah is so brittle that he is born with broken arms and legs. As he grows older, he is taunted at school and called ""Mr. Glass"" by his classmates since he is so fragile. As an adult, he runs a successful high priced comic book art gallery specializing in original drawings of superheroes.David Dunn is a security guard at the local college stadium. His marriage is crumbling and in fact, his wife, Audrey Dunn, sleeps downstairs in their son's room, and David sleeps upstairs with his son.On his way back home from a job interview in New York, David's train malfunctions and derails, killing everyone on board except David. He doesn't even have a scratch. After the memorial service for the crash victims, David finds a note on his windshield. It's from a store named ""Limited Edition"" (Elijah's store) and the note asks, ""How many days of your life have you been sick?""David asks his boss and his wife, but no one can ever remember him being sick. David takes his son to ""Limited Edition"" where he meets Elijah.Elijah explains his theory to David...
If Elijah can be born with brittle bones and very easily hurt, shouldn't there be someone the exact opposite? Elijah has researched every disaster to find a sole survivor without a scratch but has had no luck. After years of searching, he finally has found one in David Dunn.David thinks it's interesting but really just thinks Elijah is nuts. Back at the stadium, David gets a call that there is someone there trying to sneak in and asking for David. It's Elijah and he starts explaining his comic book theories to David. Theories about everyday men being superheroes, having powers they haven't yet realized and so on. David bumps into a guy in line and tells the security at the end of the line to start frisking people. They watch as the guy David bumped in to, sees everyone being frisked and leaves the line. Elijah asks David what that was all about, and David tells him that when he bumped him, he had an image of a certain kind of handgun.David goes back to work but Elijah follows the guy David bumped into. They go down a long flight of stairs, Elijah falls shattering his leg and breaking several other bones but the last thing he sees is the man's handgun, just as David described it. Elijah was right, David does have some kind of special gift.Back at home, David is working out in the basement with his weight set. His son believed everything Elijah said about David being a hero with a special gift. David still doesn't believe. David asks his son to take some weight off but without him knowing, he puts more weight on. David lifts 250 pounds, the most he's ever done. His son continues putting on more weight until David is now up to 350 pounds. He has had all this strength all along that he never knew.Elijah needs his leg rehabbed and his nurse is Audrey, David's wife. Elijah asks her questions about her and David and she explains to him how when they were going out, David was a star football player but got in a car accident due to icy roads. David never played football again. It was because of that, that she and David were married. Had he continued to play, she knows they would have grown apart.Back at work, David gets a call from his son's school that his son has been hurt. His son had hoped that some of David's superhero traits had rubbed off on him. He tried to protect someone that was being picked on and instead got hurt in the process. The school nurse remembers David from when he was at that same school. In fact, it was because of David that they have strict rules about the pool. It seems that David had been picked on near the pool when he was a student there. He fell in and was left in the pool to drown. He was found at the bottom of the pool but somehow survived.David tells this story to Elijah, that in fact, David can get hurt. Elijah tells him that every superhero has a weakness. David's kryptonite is water. The water from the pool and the water from the icy roads.David's wife decides that him surviving the train crash is a sign that maybe they should give their marriage another try. They go out on a ""date"", and he explains to her that he felt their marriage was over when he stopped waking her up after he had a bad dream.The next night, David breaks into the train station and examines some of the wrecked trains. He starts recalling his own car crash from years earlier and remembers that he wasn't hurt at all. In fact, he had to use his superhuman strength to rescue Audrey from the flaming vehicle.He goes to Elijah and tells him he is right; he has never been sick or injured in any way. Elijah tells him that it's no coincidence that David is in the security field. He needs to go to where people are and protect them.It's a rainy day and David, wearing a hooded rain poncho heads to Penn station. Hundreds of people are passing by. Whenever someone bumps into David, he has a vision of that person doing something evil. One is a jewel thief, another a rapist, but when the maintenance man bumps into him, David gets a horrible vision. The vision is of the man going to someone's home and killing the homeowner.David, still wearing the poncho now looking more and more like a superhero's cape, follows the guy as he leaves work. The guy goes to a nice house in a nice neighborhood. David sneaks in the back and finds the dead homeowner inside. He goes upstairs and rescues two sisters tied up in their bathroom. He goes into another room and finds the mother tied up. The window is open, and David looks out. When he turns back around, there is the maintenance worker who pushes David out the window. David lands on the backyard pool that has its winter cover on. Suddenly, the cover starts collapsing with David's weight and he gets all tangled up underwater with the cover. He is drowning again but the two sisters force a pole down to him and David grabs it and is saved.David heads back upstairs and wrestles with the guy and finally kills him by breaking his neck.The next scene is David back at home, hanging up his cape, er um.. poncho, and carrying his sleeping wife upstairs to their bed. She wakes up and asks him what is wrong. ""I had a bad dream"" he says.In the morning while having breakfast, David slides the newspaper over to his son and holds a finger to his mouth to shush him. The headline tells of a mystery hero that saved the two girls. The picture is an artist's rendition of what the girls saw. It shows a superhero-like figure with a hood and cape. The boy looks up at his dad and David just smiles and nods.David goes to Elijah's gallery where Elijah is having a huge gathering for a special show. He and David go to Elijah's back office so they can discuss what had happened. Elijah has been in a wheelchair since his fall. He is really proud of David and they shake hands.Suddenly...Just like Christopher Walken in Stephen King's ""The Dead Zone"", while shaking hands, David has a vision of Elijah setting a building on fire, another vision of Elijah causing a plane crash and finally, a vision of Elijah exiting the driving compartment of David's train that crashed. David looks around Elijah's office and is horrified at what he sees. Newspaper clippings of hundreds of disasters from around the world. Elijah is the mastermind behind all these events and has staged them for his own selfish benefit.Just like in the comics, every evil villain needs a worthy adversary and Elijah has finally found his.David backs away in horror as Elijah, who in his wheelchair now looks more like Professor X of the X-men, proclaims...""They call me Mr. Glass!""Just before the final credits, a message appears that says that David contacted the authorities and Elijah is now in an institution for the criminally insane."

Despite him being a police officer, all his neighbors and other citizens reject his authority with open scorn because they see him as a pushover as well as a weak and ineffective person.Flashing forward 15 years, Charlie continues to raise and spoil his three illigimate African-American sons Jamal (Anthony Anderson), Lee Harvey (Mongo Brownlee) and Shonté Jr. (Jerod Mixon), all of whom have become overweight from poor and unbalanced diets as well as use vulger and profane language from being allowed to watch foul-mouthed stand-up comedien movies from Richard Pryor to Chris Rock. Yet, all people in town continue to treat Charlie with scorn and abuse; his own neighbor steals his newspaper and allows his pet dog to deficate on the front lawn of his house; a little girl curses and insults him; a mutual friend continues to illegaly park his car and tear up parking tickets that Charlie gives him. Every townsperson on the street that Charlie interacts with takes advantage of his kind personality to further abuse him. After all the continous abuse and disrespect, Charlie's anger builds up, but he continues to keep it repressed until suddenly after a shrewd ""soccer mom"" delibrately cuts in front of him at a supermarket line, Charlie suddenly developes a rude, foul-mouthed, violent split personality named Hank. Within minutes, ""Hank"" gets revenge against all the people that have done ""Charlie"" wrong until he gets arrested by his own police co-workers. At the urging of his boss Colonel Partington (Robert Forester), Charlie visits a psychiatrist who tells him that his alter-ego Hank was created by decades of repressed anger and frustration, stemming from his wife's abandonment to his friends and neighbors scorning him, which has led to ""advanced delusionary schizophrenia with involuntary narcissistic rage.""The psychiatrist prescribes him a medicine to keep his double personality suppressed. Believing that Charlie needs a vacation, Col. Partington tells him to escort a woman named Irene Waters (Renée Zellweger) to Massena, New York because it was reported that she committed a hit and run that was actually committed by Dickie (Daniel Greene), Irene's partner. When some hit men arrive with a contract on Irene's life, Charlie agrees to help her escape, while two United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) agents are killed by the hit men. Charlie leaves his medicine behind, causing his alter ego, Hank, to surface any time he wants.Two FBI agents, Agent Boshane (Richard Jenkins) and Agent Peterson (Zen Gesner), suspect that Charlie is responsible for the assassination of the two EPA agents. While pretending to work with the police to find their father, Charlie's three sons throw the police off their father's trail, and they proceed to steal a police helicopter to get to Charlie before the police.Meanwhile, Dickie orders some corrupt agents to kill both Charlie and Irene to prevent them from testifying against the EPA where Irene used to work for on dirty dealings. After they fail, Dickie decides to settle the matter himself. During the confrontation with Dickie, Charlie manages to eliminate the alternate personality, Hank. Eventually, he manages to stop Dickie, and put an end to the corruption. With Hank gone, and all the members of the conspiracy behind bars, the film ends Irene's departure. Charlie, however, makes a road block and arrests her in order to surprise her with a marriage proposal, which she accepts.After the credits roll, there is an additional scene in which Charlie, Irene, the boys and waiter Whitey try to find Charlie's severed thumb which was blasted into a river earlier, but to no avail."
Space Cowboys,2000,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0186566/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"When retired engineer Frank Corvin (Clint Eastwood) is called upon to rescue a failing satellite, he insists that his equally old teammates accompany him into space. When a Russian satellite orbiting the Earth starts to veer off course. It seems like the guidance system in the satellite is of American origin. It's important to try and fix it before it comes into the atmosphere. N.A.S.A. man, Bob Gerson (James Cromwell) tries to find out who designed it, and discovers that it was designed by Frank Corvin (Clint Eastwood), an Air Force pilot who, forty years ago, was part of a team who was originally suppose to go to space, but when N.A.S.A. was formed and Gerson's influence, they were dropped. Gerson asks Frank to help, but Frank still holds a grudge. But after some prodding, he agrees but only if he and his team can go there so he can fix it. Gerson reluctantly agrees, so Frank recruits his former team members, ""Tank"" Sullivan (James Garner), Jerry O'Neill (Donald Sutherland), and ""Hawk"" Hawkins (Tommy Lee Jones) to join him. After some strenuous tests, they're cleared. And they go up with two other astronauts and check out the satellite and discover that they weren't told the whole truth.—rcs0411@yahoo.com In 1958, four hot shot test pilots seem certain to be the first men to go into outer space. However, the back-stabbing leader, Bob Gerson (James Cromwell), of their organization disbands them to prevent their involvement in the then-forming N.A.S.A., and labels them as non-team players. Flash forward to the present, the foursome are now living a docile life. Electrical engineer Frank Corvin (Clint Eastwood) has a pleasant retired life in a desert home with his wife Barbara (Barbara Babcock). Pilot ""Hawk"" Hawkins (Tommy Lee Jones), who had a penchant for pushing the test planes to their limits, is now a daredevil crop duster. Navigator ""Tank"" Sullivan (James Garner) is a Baptist minister. Designer Jerry O'Neill (Donald Sutherland) is a womanizing roller coaster designer. Their former boss, Eugene Davis (William Devane), is now a mission leader at N.A.S.A. and still as despicable as in his younger days. It is here that the main story begins. It seems that an old Russian ""communications"" satellite is about to crash back into the Earth's atmosphere and somehow American technology designed by Frank Corvin has ended up as the guiding system. Of course, because of the old technology, only the original team can save the day. As Bob Gerson makes many learning statements about the satellite to Russian General Vostov (Rade Serbedzija), who is working with the Americans to save the day, you know there is something much more nefarious about the satellite. After some struggles to get the four to pass their physicals in less than thirty days, the four, with two young counterparts, are launched on the space shuttle to fix the satellite. Ethan Glance (Loren Dean) has somehow been coerced to be in on the subterfuge involving Gerson, and in an unexplained action, he tries to make connections on the satellite that causes the whole mission to become a disaster and creates the greatest action sequences in this movie.—John Sacksteder <jsackste@bellsouth.net> Frank Corvin (Clint Eastwood), ""Hawk"" Hawkins (Tommy Lee Jones), Jerry O'Neill (Donald Sutherland), and ""Tank"" Sullivan (James Garner) were hotdog members of Project DAEDALUS, the Air Force's test program for space travel. Their hopes were dashed in 1958 with the formation of N.A.S.A. and the use of trained chimps. They blackmail their way into orbit when Russia's mysterious IKON communications satellite's orbit begins to degrade and threatens to crash into Earth.—Jeff Cross <blackjac_1998@yahoo.com> In 1958, two U.S. Air Force pilots and aspiring astronauts, William ""Hawk"" Hawkins (Tommy Lee Jones) and Frank Corvin (Clint Eastwood), are testing a modified Bell X-2 when Hawk decides to break a height record. The plane stalls and they are forced to eject, narrowly missing a Boeing B-50 Superfortress flying with navigator ""Tank"" Sullivan (James Garner). On the ground, Frank punches Hawk for taking unnecessary risks and jeopardizing his career, but their fight is broken up by flight engineer Jerry O'Neill (Donald Sutherland). Their boss, Bob Gerson (James Cromwell), chastises Hawk, before taking them to a press conference, where he announces that the newly created NASA, rather than the USAF, will be conducting space flight tests (A chimp is selected to be the first American in outer space). This means the end of their space dreams, including that of going to the moon.In the present day, NASA is tasked to prevent a Soviet communications satellite, IKON, from decaying out of orbit and crashing to Earth (its guidance systems are dead and the satellite is on course to crash in 35-40 days). Mission director is Sara Holland (Marcia Gay Harden). Flight Director Eugene ""Gene"" Davis (William Devane). For some reason the Soviets (led by General Vostov (Rade Serbedzija)) don't want this satellite to enter the atmosphere, and the White House has mandated NASA to provide all assistance possible.
The satellite's archaic electronics are based on those of Skylab that Frank had developed. Bob, now a project manager at NASA, requests Frank's help (He sends Sara to being Frank to NASA). Frank tells Sara to capture the satellite in the space shuttle and bring it home, but it is too big for that. Frank says that the issue cannot be fixed from Earth.
Frank still despises Bob, but agrees provided he has the help of ""Team Daedalus"" including Hawk, Tank, and Jerry. Frank talks to Jerry, who is designing roller coasters for a living. Tank, who is a priest now.. and finally Hawk, who is giving dangerous joy rides to teenagers (on their birthday) in his single engine three winged plane.. Hawk was difficult to convince, but eventually signs up.. Gene forces Frank to accept taking 2 of NASA's astronauts on the mission (Ethan and Roger), else he wont allow it..Bob plans to have younger astronauts shadow the four, so as to replace them before launch. Frank's team goes through physicals, eye tests (Jerry is blind as a bat, but memorizes the card and passes), blood tests and so on.. They have to be in good physical shape too. Frank and Hawk bet to see who passes out first on the G simulator.
Sara has a crush on Hawk. Hawk is training to be the pilot of the shuttle. He had a tendency to switch off autopilot and take manual control, and his instincts push the nose of the shuttle too high up to put it into a stall.. Hawk insists that the shuttle will not stall.
The old and young teams soon work together, with the older astronauts showing off skills learned without the aid of a computer. Ethan is supposed to learn the guidance system repair from Frank, but when Frank refuses to cooperate, Ethan lets lose that Frank and his men may not be flying to space after all. Frank confronts Bob.When the press learn of Frank's team, the Vice President convinces Bob that they must be part of the mission for publicity. Bob reveals to Frank that Hawk has cancer. Frank refuses to go without Hawk. Bob agrees to fly Hawk with the cancer.
The Space Shuttle Daedalus finds the satellite. It is not a communication satellite but in fact houses six nuclear missiles, relics from the Cold War and a violation of the Outer Space Treaty. Frank discovers that the satellite control system was stolen from Bob's files by the KGB, and that the satellite's computers will launch the missiles at predetermined targets if it falls out of orbit or goes offline. NASA and the crew plan to use the payload-assist rockets to push the satellite into deep space.
However, one of the younger astronauts, Ethan Glance (Loren Dean), acting under Bob's original orders, tries to put the satellite into stable orbit himself. He sets off a chain reaction: the satellite collides with the shuttle, damaging most of the shuttle's computer systems and engines, destroying the solar panels on the satellite, and sending it into a faster decaying orbit, while Ethan is knocked out and dragged along with the satellite.While Tank and Jerry tend to the other young astronaut Roger Hines (Courtney B. Vance), who suffered a concussion on the impact, Frank and Hawk space walk to the satellite in time to activate a booster rocket and slow the orbit's decay. As they see to Ethan, they realize that the only option is to have someone ride on the satellite as they fire the missiles' engines so that it escapes into deep space. Hawk, who was recently widowed and who has eight months to live from pancreatic cancer, sacrifices himself, hoping that he will be able to land on the Moon to fulfill his life's dream.Frank, Tank, and Jerry now plan to bring the shuttle down over water since landing it would be difficult, but the shuttle comes in too fast (without any automatic systems whatsoever, as they were all damaged in the accident with the Russian bird. Only one working engine). After safely bailing out Ethan and Roger, Tank and Jerry stay with Frank regardless of the risk. Frank recalls a maneuver Hawk had used before, purposely stalling the shuttle to drop its speed quickly and allowing him to land the shuttle safely.The film ends with the Frank Sinatra song ""Fly Me to the Moon"", zooming in on the surface of the Moon showing that Hawk had indeed landed there before he died."

Scream 3,2000,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0134084/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"While Sidney and her friends visit the Hollywood set of Stab 3, the third film based on the Woodsboro murders, another Ghostface killer rises to terrorize them.

Sydney must face the demons of her past to stop the killer(s).—reese7 While ""Stab 3"" is in production, somebody in a ghost mask starts to murder the new cast members. This lures Sidney out from hiding deep in the woods where she lives, and she comes to Hollywood to face the killer for the final act.—T-2 Cotton Weary [Liev Schrieber], now a controversial talk show host, is living a good life in Los Angeles on the fast track to fame when he's on the phone with his agent about his role in Stab 3 and other opportunities. A female fan interrupts his conversation, catering to his ego, but unfortunately Cotton learns that it's really another psycho killer Ghostface (voiced by Roger Jackson), stalking his girlfriend Christine [Kelly Rutherford] in their condo and making Cotton an offer he can't refuse: Christine's life or Sydney Prescott's location. Cotton doesn't accept the ultimatum and the killer pursues Christine. Cotton, unfortunately unable to warn her or get help from 9-1-1, and drives home erratically, while the killer uses a voice scrambler to trick Christine in believing her boyfriend is pulling a very dangerous & horrific prank on her chasing her around the condo with a knife while speaking in an insanely threatening manner. When Cotton finally arrives home and finds Christine in the study with a golf club ready to swing at him, he tries to explain that it's not him threatening her but Christine's so scared and doesn't believe him. This provides the killer ability to get the drop on her and stab her in the back and let her fall to the ground dead. Cotton meanwhile struggles with the killer, whom overpowers and stabs Cotton in the heart, letting Cotton know he failed and kills him off screen as the title comes up.Sydney Prescott [Neve Campbell] is now living in a very secluded area of California. She has a new name, a new career with California's Women Crisis Counseling service (mostly stay at home), a golden retriever for a friend, and a sophisticated security system for the entire property around her house and presumably for all doors with double bolt locks in the house. Turning on her TV, Sydney eventually learns that Cotton was targeted and killed in his home, during the production of Stab 3: Return to Woodsborough which rattles her quite a bit.Gale Weathers [Courtney Cox] is now with Total Entertainment and providing a lecture at GW Bestor Series School of Journalism when she's informed by Detective Mark Kincaid [Patrick Dempsey] that Cotton Weary was killed and a younger photo of Sydney's mother Maureen Prescott was found on Cotton's body.On the set of Stab 3, Director Roman Bridger [Scott Foley], Producer John Milton [Lance Hendricksen], and a studio executive contemplate the decision to continue production or cancel it with Cotton's death on everyone's mind including the press & the public. Violence & cinema are raised as questions, but from Roman's point of view it wasn't his idea to allow Cotton in the movie; that was the studio's. Milton said 35 years in the business; this is 1st time he's had a psycho and asks Kincaid's partner Detective Wallace [Josh Pais] about the connection between Cotton's death and the movie. Wallace suggests the obvious: ""Movie's called Stab; he was stabbed.""Also, on the set, we're introduced to Stab 3 actors Tyson Fox [Deon Richmond] playing Ricky from the video store (Randy), Tom Prinze [Matt Kesslar] playing another version of Dewey, Sarah Darling [Jenny McCarthy] playing Candy, and Angelina Tyler [Emily Mortimer] as another version of Sydney while they discuss Cotton's death & the production of the movie as well. Tyson & Angelina are worried about their futures as actors, while Tom mocks them & Sydney and wants to continue production no matter what cost. Sarah looks at them, thinking about the points made and continues reading her script.Gale finally shows up on the set, a Woodsboro replica, meets her twin Jennifer Jolie, a huge fan obsessed with her Gale character and learns Dewey's a technical advisor for Tom, guard, and clearly Jen's love interest. Dewey thinks Gale's back for the action and the story once again. Tom's ticked off about Gale's smear job on some accident he had, which she admits was her way to boost ratings at his expense. Milton sees Gale & Dewey talking and kicks her off set and as she exits the set, Jay & Silent Bob actors Jason Mewes & Kevin Smith recognize Gale and make a sarcastic remark to which Gale gives Jason the bird.Neil Prescott [Lawrence Hecht] visits his daughter at her place. Sydney naturally wishes the recent events never happened and if only her mother's past was different, life be easier. Neil asks her to come home, but Sydney defends her exiled lifestyle stating at least she can't be targeted again if they can't find her. In the next shot that night, Sydney's sleeping on her couch while her mother in a nightgown walks up to the house. Sydney opens her eyes to see her mom, staring at Sydney through the window, calling her name and talking to her hauntingly, and claws at the window before sliding down leaving blood streaks from her fingernails. Sydney gets up for a closer look and Ghostface pops in the window, says hello, and knocks the window out with a knife, startling Sydney and knocking her back on the couch turning away from the window. The dog wakes up as Sydney turns toward the window and realizes it was just a hallucination.Sarah meanwhile drives up to the Stab 3 set to meet Roman, the director, to run lines. While waiting for him, Sarah is startled by Tyson and Stan, the make-up artist. Tyson hasn't seen Roman, but Sarah waits in his office and jumps when Roman calls his office to let Sarah know he's late. Sarah's not happy with her part, but Roman says they should run lines anyway. As they go through Sarah's lines, Roman supposedly changes the name of Sarah's part to her real name in mid-script and Sarah asks if there's been another script change. Roman lets her know it's a whole new movie and Sarah's the star to be skewed like a pig. Horrified, Sarah runs out to the studio exit, seeing a shadow thinking it's the killer (really just a guard locking up) continues on through the building and hides into the costume room, calls 9-1-1 only to discover the killer has been there the whole time and begins attacking Sarah but misses. He chases her into a storage area, smacks her through a door window, and stabs her in the back.Gale & Dewey meet for lunch, discussing their relationship the last few years and Dewey's frustrated while Gale recognizes they're different. Gale suggests there's connection for sure between Cotton & Sydney, to which Dewey said a couple months back someone did try to get Sydney's case file and dispatch declined, so the records were broken into but Dewey had removed Sydney's before the thief could get it. Jennifer calls Dewey to come to her house and Gale comes along.At Jen's house, she's all worked up about Sarah's death and we meet Steven Stone [Patrick Warburton], Jen's bodyguard. Gale is astonished when Jen and Dewey agree the two murders are in the same order as the script. Gale's the third or Jennifer whichever. Dewey grabs a flashlight from his trailer and is confronted by Steven who wants to run the protection detail. Dewey's unphased.At Stab 3 set, Kincaid & Wallace discuss Sarah's murder and find Gale there asking them questions about the crime scene and Dewey discloses Jennifer is next to get killed since she's Gale. Kincaid suggests that there's actually 3 scripts going around, so there's no actual guarantee that Jennifer is next, plus Steven's watching over her so she should be fine. Roman is worried about production and is getting more heat from the studio as Sarah's death puts another damper on his production getting done and making deadline. Kincaid walks over to him letting him know Sarah was supposed to meet with him, which Roman denies even calling her. Wallace insists Sarah's roommate recognized Roman's voice, to which Roman says there's a conspiracy out to shut down his movie. Kincaid & Wallace walk Roman down to the station.Sydney's at home continuing to handle her crisis counseling calls when a female caller notifies Sydney that the caller killed someone. Sydney says she should be calling the police, to which the caller's voice insists she should be calling Sydney. It's the killer using Maureen Prescott's voice haunting Sydney and asking her to turn on the news. Sarah's death is announced to which the killer's raspy voice comes and asks Sydney if she thinks this whole thing is over. Sydney, gun in hand, looks around her house looking for the killer and looks out her window, but no Ghostface.Steven's patrolling Jen's grounds and thinks he might have heard something. Inside, Tom's ripping the crappy parts out of Stab 3, being a little sarcastic about the murders, which scares Angelina who thinks Tom's drunk because he's being a jerk and leaves the room. Tom makes a rude remark about Angelina stepping on her competitors' toes before she got the Sydney part. Jen looks at him thinking Tom made a move on Angelina and she wasn't interested. Tom denies & Jen looks at him in disbelief and has Dewey escort her to another section of the house while Tom continues ripping things up. Gale arrives at the house and starts spying on Jen & Dewey's private conversation about Gate, getting caught by Steven, who notifies Dewey to Gale's presence. Gale suggests Sarah's call was from a cloned cell phone, not Roman's. Gale talks to him about Maureen Prescott's past that there wasn't many records on Maureen Prescott when she was young. Dewey recognizes the background of Maureen's older picture and finds Jen's background is the same which concludes Maureen was an actress years ago and worked at Samoine Studios (where Stab 3 is shot).Steven's in Dewey's trailer when Dewey calls him and asks him to watch Jen as something has happened. Steven is dismissive since he doesn't work for Dewey and makes a crude remark about Dewey's sister, which pisses Dewey off. However, it's not really Dewey at the other line, but the killer who's pissed off and runs from a hiding spot in the trailer at Steven and stabs him in the back.Dewey meanwhile suggests there's an even bigger connection now between Maureen Prescott & Stab 3 and dials Kincaid when Gale looks around Jen's house and notices it's a little quiet than normal. Suddenly, the door opens but no one enters and we notice it's really just wind blowing from outside. Dewey calls for Angelina & Tom, but no response. Suddenly Jen enters the house, scaring Dewey who draws his weapon & points before recognizing Jen. Tom pops up with Angelina and Dewey points, but doesn't shoot. As Dewey puts his gun away, he looks outside one of the open doors as everyone suddenly has their attention on Steven in a zombie walk, bloodied from ears & mouth with a knife in his back trying to communicate but falls. While the others' eyes widen in horror, Dewey runs over to attend to him.Realizing the killer could be anywhere near them, Dewey instructs everyone back inside the house just as the power goes out. Frantic, everyone begins to get rattled at every noise heard, including when a phone rings and everyone's checking to see whose it is. Jen realizes it's a fax from the killer and grabs a flashlight to read it, written from the Stab 3's script reading like a riddle. Suddenly another passage, much like the first with characters in other scenarios, and ends in ""the killer will give mercy to...."" just like the first. Unsure what to do, everyone runs outside. Frustrated, Tom decides to go inside while everyone runs from the house. He reads another fax in the dark, ending with ""the killer will give mercy to whomever...."" He lights a lighter and reads that it ends in ""whomever smells gas."" Next shot, he's immediately engulfed in flame, only screaming for a second or two, as everyone watches in horror and run from the house as it explodes killing Tom.The humongous fireball erupts forcing the survivors to jump over a railing from Jen's patio and land on a steep dirty hill, rolling down and landing in various flat areas over several yards in the back of the property. The movie follows Dewey as he gets up, looks around and can't see where everyone else went, & calls for Gale & Jennifer and they reply back (off-screen) from a far distance. Dewey looks for Gale, sees her down at the bottom of the hill standing on the road near an SUV. Before the killer is able to attack Gale from behind, Dewey shoots the killer, to which the killer rolls under the SUV and disappears. Meanwhile, not careful of his footing while firing his weapon, Dewey looses his balance and falls down the hill next to the SUV and joins Gale looking for the killer. Gale thanks Dewey for saving her and they're about to kiss when Jen shows up, freaking out wondering where was Dewey in protecting her and slugs him. Gale turns and immediately punches Jen in the mouth, causing Jen to fall to the ground. Jen turns and suggests she's ready to sue (her lawyer going to love Gale's assault on Jen). Gale feels much better though, considering Jen was being a bitch. They hear a noise and turn to their right seeing Angelina, walking toward them, almost in shock, frightened and mourning Tom's death asking if they're safe for now. Dewey suggests they're fine now. Dewey, remembering the killer had rolled under the SUV, looks under the SUV finding another picture of Maureen Prescott, on the back a message, ""I killed her.""At the LAPD office, Gale and Dewey meet with Kincaid and discuss this latest development. Gale suggests they know Billy Loomis and Stu Monker killed Maureen Prescott and went in grave detail about it to Sydney from the first movie. Kincaid suggests Sydney was wrong before, maybe this is from the real killer. Frustrated with the situation, Kincaid & Wallace need answers since there's three dead celebrities, a bodyguard, and now the mayor isn't happy with this threat & the press it's receiving. Gale asks the question: What does Stab 3 and Maureen Prescott have in common? Where's the link? Kincaid suggests well Maureen's picture is at the same studio as Stab 3 is shooting from. Kincaid suggests Sydney might know since she knows her mother and Dewey suggests her father was married to Maureen and he doesn't know much either. Kincaid and Wallace feel the pressure & are ready to interrogate Dewey, who feels of course on the spot & at the gallows. Gale diffuses the argument, to which Kincaid insists they bring Sydney in or Gale and Dewey will be charged with obstruction of justice.Dewey calls Sydney and begins leaving a message when he sees Sydney has come in to LAPD, hanging up to greet her. They catch up and talk a little about Gale. Sydney asks what's going on and wants to meet with Kincaid. Dewey confronts her for coming out of the cold, but Sydney responds that the killer contacted her home phone, realizing it's only a matter of time before her isolated life won't feel so safe anymore. Sydney rather joins Dewey and Gale to solve this mystery. Dewey introduces Kincaid to Sydney and lets Kincaid and Gale know the killer called Sydney. Sydney suggests that it was the same old bullshit, catching up & how she wants to die. While Kincaid, Gale & Dewey discuss leads, Sydney looks at her mother's pictures on Kincaid's wall. Kincaid informs her that the killer is leaving these pictures at every murder site and asks about the connection. Gale asks her whether Maureen was an actress or a model years ago, since the background in Maureen's shots match Jen's in the studio. Sydney suggests to Kincaid she's ready to visit Stab 3 set.Just when Sydney, Dewey, Gale, Kincaid and Wallace arrive to enter the set, Randy Meek's little sister Martha [Heather Matarazzo] walks out and scares them. Dewey prevents Wallace and two uniform officers from shooting the young girl, since Sydney & Dewey know her. Martha suggests she misses them not being in Woodsborough and shows them a videotape they need to see. It's Randy back at Windsor College during the time of Scream 2 a few years ago, leaving his legacy by acknowledging it's possible he won't make it out and that the killer may come back for a third time. Sydney is really surprised at how Randy prepared for a third sequel vs. the third & final chapter in a trilogy. Randy's sure the past is now a clean slate, different than what everyone knew before, and warns Sydney that in a trilogy as the main character in this live horror trilogy Sydney's destined to die in the end. This 3rd round could be a bloodbath like Reservoir Dogs before it's over. Randy wishes them well and suggests to the group that he might see them soon because some may not make it out alive. Sydney and Dewey hug Martha goodbye and Martha leaves.Gale takes a walk around the studio and tries to open a door but needs a key to get in. Jen approaches her which freaks her out. Using Jen's pass key, they enter the studio and meet Bianca [Carrie Fisher], the studio's bitter records coordinator. For an inside joke, Gale asks her if she's Carrie Fisher and Bianca says she isn't and suggests that Carrie Fisher slept with George Lucas to get the part of Leia in the Star Wars trilogy. Jen is astonished at how familiar they look (done for comedic effect of course). Gale apologizes and asks for information on Maureen. Bianca resists initially for a $50 bribe Gale offers, but Jen takes a step further and offers one of her expensive jewelry valued at $2,000, next shot Bianca's pulling a file on Maureen Prescott's stage name Reina Reynolds. Gale reviews the file which enlists all of Reina's films, some directed by John Milton, the producer of Stab 3, raisinh Gale's and Jen's eyebrows.Hanging around the Stab 3 set, Sydney is washing her hands in the bathroom when she hears a clang in the stalls behind her which rattles her a little and tries to get a grip until she hears another. Just like in the first movie, she looks underneath only to see boots stepping off the floor to stand on the toilet seat. She arms herself with pepper spray and kicks in the stall door to find Angelina Tyler. Angelina is startled by Sydney's assault on the door at first, but immediately recognizes her. Feeling bummed out that production is shut down due to the murders and convinced that her career is likely over, Angelina grabbed some souvenirs to remember Hollywood by. Feeling sympathetic about Sydney's past & current ordeal, Angelina states it was a great opportunity and she wanted to do right by Sydney. Sydney sighs and says Angelina probably would have. Unusually wound up, Angelina is amazed as the target of her portrayal is right there and wished she finished production. Angelina collects, with Sydney's help, the memorabilia, leaves the bathroom and heads out of the studio. Sydney finds Angelina left something on the floor in the stall and exists the bathroom only to see Angelina's gone.Sydney looks around and heads down a hallway which leads to the set, feeling a little nostalgic while looking to see if anyone else is there. She continues walking around the set and enters her ""pretend"" house and ""bedroom."" This brings back happier memories of her conversation with her ex boyfriend Billy before he became a Ghostface psycho. She then hears a noise looking outside her ""fake bedroom window"" but doesn't see anything. Behind her a door closes startling her, so she opens the closet door and adjoins them which forces both doors to flex a little (just a draft) as Sydney gets rattled. She backs away from the doors, thinking the killer is coming only to discover Ghostface appears in the window behind her and pulls her out of the bedroom onto the set floor. Sydney manages to escape and goes inside another house, where Ghostface appears and chases Sydney up the stairs. Sydney frantically slows the killer down and runs up a couple floors, calling for Dewey to get on the set. Hearing a voice from another room, Sydney's curiosity brings her to her mother's death scene. Scared and upset, she hears more voices and sees on the floor a fake cadaver covered by a white sheet with blood spots on it. The voices of her mother, Stu, & Billy seem to be coming from it. She runs toward the window and continues to hear her mother's voice as she turns to see the sheet has rose with her mother's haunting voice. Sydney jumps out of the window calling for Dewey and somersaults onto the set floor.Lights turn on as Dewey, Wallace, and some police officers rush in from a set door to Sydney, who's crying by now and informs them the killer is upstairs in the fake house. Dewey said Sydney shouldn't have been up there, since that's the production preparation for Maureen's dead scene. Wallace and some officers go up there to check it out, but the killer has vanished. Angelina and Tyson walk in to find out what happened while Kincaid rushes in to Sydney's side. Wallace interrogates Angelina and Tyson and question Angelina about the stalker mask she took for memorabilia. Kincaid confronts Sydney about seeing the killer on the set and Sydney swears he was there in ""Woodsborough"" (on the set). Kincaid reminds her it's just a set, not the real thing, which Sydney acknowledges but insists someone in a Ghostface costume was stalking her on the set. Dewey comforts her and suggests everyone believes her, as does Kincaid who drives Sydney back to the precinct for her protection while they figure out what's going on and who's trying to get to her. Jen and Gale walk over to Dewey and confirm Maureen Prescott, under the stage name Reina Reynolds, was an actress working for, none than, John Milton, Stab 3's producer at the studio.Roman is having a lengthy argument with Milton in the latter's office about the reason behind these murders and the fact it's happening while Stab 3's in production. They are interrupted by Jen, Gale, and Dewey who want to know what the hell Milton and Reina Reynold's history is. Roman asks them who Reina Reynolds is, but Milton suggests Roman should concern himself with his birthday party and not to cut the cake without Milton. Jen realizes it's Roman's birthday and wishes him ""Happy Birthday."" Disgusted with his bad luck, Roman suggests as if he doesn't had enough problems he has to celebrate his birthday and leaves the office. Dewey confronts Milton about knowing Reina Reynolds/Maureen Prescott and Milton acts like he doesn't know anything, until Dewey says he'll give Kincaid a call if he doesn't get a straight answer. Milton acknowledges he knows Reina Reynolds. Jen, breaking into her overly hyped Gale Weathers shtick, confronts Milton about making money off Reynolds/Prescott's death, and accuses him of being obsessed with Maureen and her daughter Sydney. Gale settles Jen with humor calling her ""Geraldo"", no doubt for Geraldo Rivera, famous for that type of reporting for money and ratings. Milton suggests Stab wasn't his idea and making the film he realizes he knew Maureen Prescott as Reina. He knew the controversy behind the murder and was worried about the press because he knew the victim, but Gale doesn't buy it and presses him about their history. Milton acknowledges Reina was working for him, was invited to a lot of his parties, and was desperate to make something of herself. Gale asks him if Reina was possibly attacked. Milton acknowledges things got out of hand and maybe some producers and directors took advantage of Reina and that maybe Reina wasn't cut out for Hollywood. He also acknowledges no charges were brought. Milton felt Reina couldn't play by the rules and that's why she didn't last in Hollywood.Sydney and Kincaid meanwhile talk about movie trilogies, his job, Sydney's ghosts (as Kincaid does get them too - hazard of the trade unfortunately), and about Maureen Prescott. Kincaid confirms Sydney's most likely telling the truth about Ghostface on set, which is good news because if this killer was there, then there's two ways to take them down: catch 'em or kill 'em, just like every other bad guy Kincaid dealt with. Sydney asks him what's his favorite scary movie, to which Kincaid responds his life is the most horrific and Sydney concurs as she been there the past 4-5 years.Dewey, Gale, and Jen meanwhile are returning back to the precinct to talk to Sydney and Kincaid about what they found when Dewey receives a phone call from Sydney while driving, suggesting that Milton supposedly called her to come over to his mansion to give Sydney some information. Dewey suggests it's not safe for Sydney to be out there, but Sydney suggests Kincaid is with her. They arrive at Milton's place and are greeted by birthday boy Roman and ask him where Sydney is. He says she's in the mansion and leads them inside, only to find out that he really means Angelina, the actress who plays Sydney in Stab 3. Tyson is also there as well sitting on Milton's couch. Gale confirms she means Sydney Prescott and Roman suggests that he would have never invited her here, but Gale suggests Sydney's coming which Roman doesn't mind.Roman suggests he wants to walk around the Milton mansion, but Tyson confronts him with the idea that a killer is on the loose and whenever Dewey for example is confronted in one of these situations he's left as a shishkabob. Jen volunteers to walk around the place with Roman and they head to the basement which scares Jen, who watches Roman go down the stairs in bad lighting. Tyson and Angelina go up stairs and look at the various posters Milton produced and posted on his walls. Roman seeks a coffin in the basement and opens to find a fake skeleton with eyeballs in its sockets. It's a little scary to him but he manages. He hears a noise behind him and looks over while Jen calls him from up the stairs and hears a clanging sound for a couple seconds, but no Roman.Dewey and Gale are concerned about why Sydney hasn't showed up, so they recheck the phone call they received by dialing it and hear the ring tone in a closet within the living area, turn on the light to see the phone, the voice scrambler which has everyone's voices, and a Ghostface mask, implying the killer is at the mansion. Dewey arms Gale with a gun and they split up in different areas of the house, calling for the others. Dewey finds Tyson and informs him that Stab 3's back in production (the killer's on the hunt to kill off characters for real once more). Gale finds the basement door and calls for Roman and Jen, then goes down to the basement, opens the coffin, and finds Roman dead with a knife in his chest. This naturally sets Gale back and bumps into Jen, which gives them both a jump.Gale and Jen run upstairs looking for Dewey and find Angelina. They inform her Roman's dead. Angelina wants to leave, but Gale and Jen want to find the others. Angelina confirms she slept with Milton to get Sydney's part and doesn't want to die in vain with Gale and Jen. Dewey calls Gale from another room while Angelina panicking continues to run down the hallway, makes a right, and another left and runs right into the killer who stabs her to death. Gale and Jen hear Angelina's blood curdling scream and run down the same pathway and find her down stairs being dragged off screen.Gale and Jen finally run into Dewey and informs him Roman and Angelina are dead, just then the killer gets the drop on them and punches Dewey in the head. Gale and Jen run into the bedroom and find Tyson, while the killer tracks them down and pushes Tyson away. Dewey confronts the killer, gets slashed in the arm and punched again. Tyson gets physical with the killer and is stabbed in the abdomen. Jen decides to hide in the bathroom while Gale picks up a vase and throws it at the killer. Tyson is able to get up and run, yelling help and police (like anyone would hear it inside a closed windowed house). The killer, realizing he's still mobile, chases after Tyson and catches up with him, throwing him into a vase case, and out an open window with a balcony onto the brick patio killing Tyson as his head smacks against the pavement.Jen finds Milton's secret passage way in the house and walks down some steps, only to find the killer has as well and chases her up the stairs. Running from the killer, in the passage way, Jen finds Dewey in the bedroom and begins knocking on the tinted windows trying to get his attention, so he realizes someone's back there. The killer finally catches up and attacks her as Gale joins Dewey and they realize the mirrors are shaking, so Dewey begins shooting them out one at a time, only to realize by the last one Jen falls to her death through the broken window pane as Ghostface had already killed her and disappears.Dewey and Gale go back to the main section of the hallway and can't find Sydney who hasn't arrived yet. Meanwhile the killer attacks Gale while Dewey's away and they struggle right just outside the kitchen at the basement entrance to the house and falling backward through the open door and down the steps. Knocked out the killer lands on the bottom step while Gale is down on the basement floor and manages to get up only to realize the killer is in between her and her means of escaping. Dewey walks outside in the common area finding Tyson dead on the bricks and calls for Gale. From the basement, Gale hears him calling while the killer has a little reflex but not enough strength to wake up and passes out. Upstairs, Dewey receives a call from Gale downstairs, asking him to open the basement door, but is instantly suspicious since he fears the killer is once again using her voice to attract his attention. Gale insists it's really her speaking and he should just open the door. The killer finally wakes up at the bottom, just as Dewey opens the door and truthfully it was Gale talking him. Dewey tries to shoot the killer before Gale is attacked, but realizes he doesn't have any bullets, so the killer throws his knife up the steps at Dewey and luckily the handle part is the one that hits Dewey in the head, causing him to lose his balance and fall down the steps. Gale attends to him, while the killer flashes his knife standing before them.At the police station, everyone's working 2nd shift and Sydney's still in Kincaid's office, foot on the desk bored, confirming it was the killer who called Dewey and sent him, Gale, and Jen down to Milton's. She happens to see her file on Kincaid's desk and opens it to see dozens of articles, forms, and news clippings about the past 4 years from Maureen's death to now. She receives a call and hears herself like an echo. It's really the killer with the voice scrambler, who changes to his normal raspy voice and suggests that he has Gale and Dewey and wants Sydney at Milton's place ASAP. Sydney immediately wants to attract Kincaid's attention to the call, but the killer lets her know it's not happening and if she does, she won't see her friends alive again. She says ""Where?"" to which the killer says he'll let her know when she's on the road.Sydney opens Kincaid's drawer and grabs his backup gun. When Sydney arrives at the mansion, she checks on Tyson and realizes he's dead and looks around, just as the killer calls her and asks she run the metal detector over her body, which beeps at her ankle. The killer insists she remove the gun and throw it in the pool which Sydney does. The killer insists she join the party inside, which she suggests that she won't, but he keeps saying that Dewey and Gale are right inside and she should take a look. Gale and Dewey are hogtied and Sydney walks over to them and starts working on releasing Dewey and Gale from being taped up. Just then Ghostface creeps up behind Sydney as she turns and smacks her across the face and she falls. He's ready to stab her when she draws Kincaid's gun, pointing it at the killer and shoots a few shots. Sydney continues to start untaping Gale and Dewey and Gale looks up at where Ghostface fell and notices the masked killer's no longer there. Sydney looks over and sees that the killer's missing too and grabs the gun and looking around.Kincaid shows up, only to discover Sydney becomes suspicious of the fact he's alone and doesn't trust him. Diffusing the fear and intensity in Sydney's eyes, Kincaid withdraws his weapon to show good faith and calm her down. Ghostface pops out of nowhere, knocks out Sydney, and attacks Kincaid struggling with him, knife in hand, and Kincaid manages to overpower him, but not before the killer kicks him in the stomach and Kincaid loses balances, hits his head on the mantle of the fireplace, and falls to the ground. Sydney manages to get up and fires the gun at the killer who ducts, tries to fire again but the gun's out of bullets, so she throws it away and challenges the killer to chase after her. The killer draws his knife and lunges at her. Sydney manages to move out of his path and the killer falls through the window while Sydney runs down the main hallway, with the killer back up in hot pursuit. She runs into Milton's study, locks the door, and looks for a secret passage way access on the bookcases which she finds and enters Milton's private study, locking the door to the exit back. Sydney sees a movie on a screen of her mother and can hear her mother's voice, which again turns out to be the killer in the same white sheet with blood stains on it from the set. Upset, Sydney tries to escape but the killer locks up the safe room.The killer lays out the truth. She asks who he is, to which he informs her he's the other half of her - her sibling, in short. In his raspy voice, the killer tells her he searched for a mother too, an actress named Reina Reynolds, and when he finally tracked her down she turned him away, saying that she had a new life and a new name, that Reina doesn't exist anymore, and Sydney was the only child Maureen claimed. The killer suggests she wouldn't acknowledge her son, as he takes off his mask, revealing the killer to be Stab 3 Director Roman Bridger, back from the dead. Roman continues his story about how Maureen said Roman was Reina's child and Reina's dead, so he figured if Reina's truly dead, he'll make it real and begins stalking her, filming her every move, making a movie which shows the good and bad of Maureen Prescott. Roman talks about how Maureen was sleeping around, mentions Cotton which everybody knew, but then Billy's father - that's what he needed. He showed the film to Billy, which motivated and coached Billy on how to solve both their problems with a few tips including a partner (Stu), find someone to frame (Cotton), almost as if Billy was making the movie. Sydney concludes that Roman was responsible for everything the last 4 years, to which he suggests that he's a director, he directs, meaning he knows what sequence he wants for anything and will go through several organized plans to make it happen whether preparing for a scene or seeing someone executed premeditated. Roman informs Sydney he had no idea that Gale would write the book and the studio would make a movie about it, but is quite fascinated with the idea until he realizes they portrayed Sydney as the victim and the star of the movie which clearly pissed him off.Dewey finally gets loose, helps Gale, and they attend to Kincaid who's still managing and hands Dewey a gun and tells him to get the killer. Dewey and Gale start trying to break into the study with great success. Sydney acknowledges Roman's plan succeeded and the showdown shall continue with the villain Roman dying at Sydney's hand. Roman corrects her saying he's not the villain and Sydney is so she'll be no longer. He also reveals to her the hogtied Milton, suggests how Milton and his posse attacked Reina/Maureen, messed her up, made her a whore, and asks if Sydney hates Milton for what he did. Roman shows her he recorded a message he created using Sydney's voice threatening Milton. Milton attempts to bribe and beg Roman to spare his life. Roman slits his throat, while Sydney snaps and throws the responsibility on Roman who continues his rendition on how he intends to have Sydney framed for the murder and the other murders. Roman truly believes he's going to get away with this as he lays out why Sydney supposedly does the crimes. Sydney cuts him off, informing him the truth is that he's a whack job like every other she dealt with and he's responsible for his own actions, which Roman clearly can't handle facing the idea that she's right and he's going down. He gets pissed, have a loud argument, and Sydney and Roman begin to struggle.Meanwhile, Dewey and Gale look for a way inside the safe room, finally shorting the safe lock and the lights. Kincaid using a couple pins finds his own way in, opening another door and asks Sydney where the killer is. Unfortunately, Roman gets the drop on Kincaid and knocks him out. Roman looks over the cop, withdrawing Kincaid's weapon and make sure there isn't another weapon on him. Sydney grabs Roman's knife and confronts him, to which Roman responds that he has a gun and shoots her in the abdomen. He walks up to her and shoots in the chest and she passes out, supposedly dying. Roman grabs his knife as he hears Dewey and Gale calling for Sydney and threatening him if he harms her. While locking the other exit, he turns to Sydney only to discover she's missing. Off screen, she grabs an ice pick while Roman searches for her, flipping out that the same game he's playing is played on him while hearing that Dewey and Gale continue their efforts to unlock the door to the safe room. Roman decides to call Sydney's phone as a means to track her down, which works as it rings very close by. All of a sudden Sydney jumps out from behind the bar and stabs Roman who falls and turns toward her suggesting he thought he killed her. Sydney reveals she's wearing an LAPD standard issued bullet vest, Roman is amused, and Sydney concludes they must think alike and stabs Roman in the chest. Finally, Dewey and Gale bust into the safe room and see Sydney, kneeling over Roman, who's dressed in black cloak, stabbed, realizing that he was Ghostface this time around. Gale tends to Kincaid, who's wounded but still fine, while Dewey keeps a gun pointed on Roman. Roman reaches out to Sydney to hold her hand as he's supposedly dying. Dewey suggests she be careful since the killer always generally comes back for one last scare in a horror movie. Sydney suggests this isn't a movie at all, and low & behold Roman gets up, grabs a knife, starts screaming like a maniac, lunging at them, and Dewey fires his into Roman's chest, but to no avail apparently Roman definitely has his own vest and manages to stop the bullets before they reach his body. Sydney realizes this and yells to Dewey to shoot him in the head, which Dewey finally registers and shoots Roman point blank, killing him. Dewey thanks Sydney for her help as they look at Roman.At Sydney's house in secluded California, Dewey and Gale visit and look at the beautiful landscape from the house and watch Sydney walking back up to the property with her dog once more. Dewey asks Gale to sign ""The Woodsborough Murders"", which Gale thought he hated, but he insists. She opens the book's cover to realize it's just a fake book to disguise Dewey's engagement ring and he proposes. After some consideration of their differences and their time slots, Gale accepts and they kiss.Sydney opens up the gate, but noticeably doesn't close it and punch the code. At the house, she enters and is ready to arm the security system, but stops herself, debating on whether to let herself continue to live a controlled paranoid life or to live a little and take a chance. She chooses the latter as Kincaid, with arm in sling, walks in to greet her with popcorn and invites her for a movie in the living room. Sydney asks what kind of movie, to which Kincaid suggests she has to find out for herself as Dewey and Gale walk in too and have a seat. Sydney sighs and walks in when she hears the door open behind her and turns around to watch it swing open and wait for a sign that someone's after her, but nothing, only the wind blowing. Sydney turns and just grabs a seat and the screen goes back as the credits begin to roll."
U-571,2000,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0141926/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A German submarine is boarded by disguised American submariners trying to capture their Enigma cipher machine. In the midst of World War II, the battle below the seas rages. The Nazis have the upper edge as the Allies are unable to crack their war codes. That is, until a wrecked U-boat sends out an SOS signal, and the Allies realize this is their chance to seize the 'enigma coding machine'. But masquerading as Nazis and taking over the U-boat is the smallest of their problems. The action really begins when they get stranded on the U-boat.—Filmtwob <webmaster@filmfreak.co.za> During World War II, the Allies were having trouble against the German Navy especially their U-Boats because of their highly sophisticated cipher machines. When a German U-Boat is damaged and is waiting for assistance, the Americans decide that this is an opportunity for them to get the machine. So they have one of their subs made up to look like a German, and plan to pretend to be the ship sent to assist them and take control of the U-Boat and take the machine and destroy the sub so that the Germans will not know that they have the machine. And everything went according to plan; they got the machine and transferred the crew to their sub and were about to leave when out of nowhere they're hit by a torpedo from the German relief sub. The members of the crew who were not on board the sub, proceed to board the German U-Boat and try to make it back. Now the senior officer is the sub's XO who's eager to be in command but his commander had told him earlier that he felt he was not ready because he might not be ready to make tough decisions. And now he has to, if he and the survivors are to survive.—rcs0411@yahoo.com In the battle front of espionage and code cracking of World War II, there remains but one task on the Allied agenda: the capture of a German ""Enigma"" machine which will allow the Allied naval forces to locate and track submerged German U-Boat submarines. When one such German vessel breaks down after a battle with British forces, a secret mission is dispatched to take over the U-Boat by commando American forces and retrieve an Enigma machine intact. The raid goes well, at first, yet following the destruction of the American mothership and the arrival of reenforcement German ships, the Americans trapped on the U-Boat must use their training and wits to pilot U-571 in order to save their lives.—Anthony Hughes <husnock31@hotmail.com> German U-boat U-571 is immobilized by a British destroyer. The US Navy submarine S-33 has been modified to resemble a German U-boat to steal the Enigma coding device and sink the U-571.During a storm, the S-33 comes across U-571 and sends a boarding party over. After securing the ship and transporting the captured crew back to the American S-33 sub, the S-33 gets sunk by the arrival of a German resupply sub. The captain of the S-33, Lieutenant Commander Dahlgren, dying in the water, orders his men on the captured U-boat to submerge. Lieutenant Tyler takes command of the enemy U-boat and dives to engage the resupply sub in an underwater battle before destroying it.After making repairs and restoring power Tyler decides to route the disabled submarine to Land's End in Cornwall, England. They are spotted by a German plane which is unaware that the U-571 has been commandeered by Americans; a nearby German destroyer sends over a small contingent but right before boarders arrive, Tyler gives orders to fire a shot from the deck gun, destroying the German ship's radio room, and preventing it from reporting that the capture of a German sub and its Enigma machine and code books. The sub dives underneath the German ship, which then begins to drop depth charges to sink U-571.Tyler attempts to trick the destroyer into stopping its attack by ejecting debris and a corpse out of a torpedo tube, faking their own destruction. The German destroyer continues dropping depth charges. U-571, hiding at below 600 feet (180 m), is damaged by the high water pressure. Control of the main ballast tanks is lost and the ship ascends uncontrollably. Tyler orders crewman Trigger to submerse himself in the bilge underwater to repressurize the torpedo tubes.Trigger uses an air hose to enter the flooded compartment. He closes the air valve to the torpedo tubes, but a second leak and broken valve are found, which Trigger can't reach. U-571 surfaces, unable to fire its last torpedo. The destroyer fires on the ship, which is heavily damaged and begins to flood. The first hit causes pipes to collapse, pinning Trigger's leg, after he has left the air hose behind. Unable to turn back, he reaches for the valve and closes it before he dies. The second the pressure is available, Tyler orders Tank to fire the final torpedo. The German destroyer is destroyed. As the crew sigh in relief, Tank reports Trigger's death. U-571 has taken severe damage and will not remain afloat for long. The crew abandons ship with the Enigma in their possession. The crew watch U571 as she slips beneath the waves. Floating aboard an inflatable lifeboat, they are eventually rescued by a US Navy PBY Catalina flying boat."

She assumes he is an alien who took her father's place for a while. After making him promise not to hurt the family, she starts assisting him with routine matters such as changing diapers, where the schools are, where he works and what he usually does every day. He begins to succeed in his life, bonding with his children, falling in love with his wife and working hard at his dull job.When his former boss and mentor, Peter Lassiter, happens by the store for a tire change, Jack can't help but comment about the merger his company has just brokered -- for a price less than what Jack himself would have aimed for. The chairman is impressed by his business savvy and ideas and invites Jack to a meeting with him and the president of the company. The president turns out to be Alan Mintz, one of Jack's sycophantic employees who now displays an assertiveness he did not have as a subordinate. Jack uses his knowledge of both men to prove that he is good at sizing people up and that he could be a good asset to the company. Lassiter offers him the job.While she is impressed by the potential salary increase and other benefits, Kate argues that they are very happy where they are and that they should be thankful for the life they have. She also argues that Jack's new career would either take him away from his children or force them to leave a home and a school they already love.Later, back at home, Jack finds his plane ticket to London from 1987 and discovers he actually took the flight, but then came back the next day to be with Kate. Aware of the choice he made back then, Kate tells Jack that if he truly needs to try this investment thing, she will follow him, move the family back to the big city and do what needs to be done just as Jack did for her back then.The next morning, Kate awakens to find Jack outside playing with their daughter, implying Jack has chosen to stay. Annie looks at Jack and finally recognizes that her true father has returned, to which Jack replies that he truly loves her.That night, while Jack is looking for rock salt in his garage, Annie rings the bicycle bell, which suddenly worries Jack. He goes to a local store where he finds the store clerk is Cash. Jack demands to stay in this life, but, though sorrowful of Jack's situation, Cash informs him there's nothing he can do. A glimpse is not meant to be permanent. Jack then goes home and asks Kate to promise him twice that she will always remember him the way he is right now. He then kisses his children goodnight and spends the night watching over his sleeping wife while he, himself, unsuccessfully fights off sleep.Jack awakens in his penthouse bed on Christmas Day. His experiences have caused him to realize he lives a lonely, unfulfilled life. He goes to work without much motivation to find out his $130 billion deal is at risk and he needs to move fast to save it. Jack offers to sacrifice his own Christmas to save the deal and reassures his team, but deep down, he doesn't care much any more.Following up on Kate's message to him the previous day, he finds her moving out of a luxury townhouse. Like Jack, she also focused on her career and became a wealthy lawyer. Furthermore, she only called him to give him back some of his old possessions before she moves to Paris. Jack invites her to go grab a coffee, but she's in a bit of a rush. She says maybe they'll have that coffee later in Paris one day. Jack goes home with his possessions, among which he finds pictures of himself and Kate, young and in love. Realizing he still loves her, Jack forgoes his very important deal and runs to the airport to intercept Kate before she leaves. He catches her and desperately describes the family they had in the alternate universe and the love they shared in an effort to make her stay. Shocked but intrigued, she agrees to a cup of coffee at the airport, suggesting that they might have a future after all."
Hollow Man,2000,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0164052/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A brilliant scientist's discovery renders him invisible, but transforms him into an omnipotent, dangerous megalomaniac. Having discovered they could turn animals invisible, a group of scientists test the subject on a human. Head of research, Dr. Sebastian Caine decides to use himself as the subject. After the experiment can't be reversed, it takes a toll on Caine's personality, causing him to hunt down and kill his colleagues After years of experimentation, brilliant but arrogant scientist Sebastian Caine has discovered a way to make matter invisible. Determined to achieve the ultimate breakthrough, Caine pushes his team to move to the next phase - using himself as the subject. The test is a success, but when the process can't be reversed and Caine seems doomed to future without flesh, he begins to show some unexpected side effects of his extraordinary condition.—Nick Kat A group of scientists, led by the brilliant yet eccentric Twinkie-addicted Sebastian Caine, are successfully researching invisibility. Having accomplished making animals invisible, Caine insists on being the next subject for the experiment. Unfortunately, the serum effects not only the external physical nature of the subject, but morphs the internal personality too. And that's when things start to go horribly wrong...—Filmtwob <webmaster@filmfreak.co.za> This film is loosely based on H. G. Wells' ""The Invisible Man"", with Dr. Sebastian Caine (actor Kevin Bacon) taking the place of Doctor Jack Griffin (actor Claude Rains) and updates the story to the 20th Century. In this version of Wells' story, the doctor is a brilliant, but slightly megalomaniacal molecular biologist, and is working on an invisibility serum for the U.S. military, as well as a serum that will return the subject back to visibility. Sebastian has been attempting to perfect the formula for the last four years, and he conducts his experiments on animals kept inside a top-secret hidden military lab accessible only to him and his staff. His current project is reversing the invisibility effect on his test subject, a female gorilla named Isabelle. What the team discovered is that ""phase-shifting"" a living organism into invisibility was easy to achieve but phasing them back to visibility has proven very difficult. Working late one night on re-configuring the molecular model of the irradiated protein that will restore Isabelle to visibility, he solves the problem and immediately reports his success to the top members of his staff.Although work on the serum occupies nearly all of his waking hours, Sebastian becomes obsessed with his ex-girlfriend Dr. Linda McKay (Elisabeth Shue), who is a scientist on his team. Unbeknownst to him, she has become involved with Dr. Matt Kensington (Josh Brolin), another member of their research group. Sebastian and his colleagues, who also include veterinarians Sarah Kennedy (Kim Dickens) and Carter Abbey (Greg Grunberg), and technicians Frank Chase (Joey Slotnick) and Janice Walton (Mary Randle), eventually enable the serum to work on the gorilla. In celebration, the team goes out for a fancy dinner, where Sebastian makes a toast to the greatest research group in the world. To Sebastian, however, it feels like the end as reversion was the last big breakthrough.Instead of reporting his success to the military, Sebastian inexplicably lies to the oversight committee including his old teacher Dr. Howard Kramer (William Devane), and talks Linda and Matt into lying to the other four team members, saying that Kramer and the board have given them the go-ahead for human testing. The subject: Sebastian, himself. Despite a painful shift to transparency, the procedure is successful. After being unconscious for about 17 hours due to shock, Sebastian wakes up in pain, and recoiling from the ambient light, realizing that he can see through his eyelids. He then conducts some clinical tests on himself. But when it comes time to return to visibility after three days, the reversion fails and almost kills him.The researchers construct a latex mask for the Sebastian to wear around the lab, crudely approximating a human appearance. During this time, Matt discovers a promising way to make Sebastian visible again. A computer simulation, however, fails. Over the next several days, isolation and virtual imprisonment in the lab begin to wear on Sebastian's patience. Disobeying Carter and his own rules, he sneaks out and goes to his apartment to grab some books, CDs and Twinkies to take back to the lab. There, temptation gets the best of him, and he first spies on his neighbor (Rhona Mitra), and then rapes her, while fully invisible. Linda shows up at the apartment and finds the mask and clothes, but no Sebastian.Sebastian returns to the lab just as the others were planning to go after him. Linda warns him that if he leaves again, she and Matt will tell Dr. Kramer what they did. Ignoring their threat, he assembles a device that runs a video loop of his heat signature in his quarters; the repeating image fools Frank into believing that Sebastian is still in the lab, when, in fact, he is out spying on Linda and Matt.At Linda's place, Sebastian sees Matt and Linda together about to have sex and smashes their bedroom window. The two call Frank, who tells them that Sebastian is still in bed. Meanwhile, an enraged Sebastian returns to the lab, frustrated and angered at the thought of Linda and Matt together. Unable to stand the annoying barking of an invisible dog, Sebastian approaches the dog, reassuring it that he means it no harm, then kills it with his bare hands by brutally smashing it against the cage wall. The team soon discover that they have been watching a recording and that Sebastian has been leaving without their knowledge.Linda and Matt go to Dr. Kramer's house and tell them about the experiment on Sebastian. Dr. Kramer is disappointed, and tells them that they are fired from the project. Dr. Kramer then attempts to call the military and inform them about Sebastian, but Sebastian has actually followed Linda and Matt to the house. Sebastian tricks Kramer into leaving the house and then drowns him in his own swimming pool.The next day, Sebastian waits until all of the team is in the lab and then disables the phones and all of the elevator codes except for his own. He removes his clothing and latex mask and begins to hunt them all down. Janice falls behind while the team searches for Sebastian and he strangles her with an IV line and stuffs her body in a locker.After they find Janet's body, Linda, Sarah, and Frank hide in the lab while Matt and Carter take tranquilizer guns to go hunting for Sebastian in the empty hallways using thermographic imaging goggles. Matt shoots at a heat signature from a steam vent. When Matt turns around, Carter has been yanked into the air by Sebastian, who is on top of a pipe. Matt tries to shoot him, but Sebastian throws Carter down toward a steel bar, which cuts his carotid artery, causing massive blood loss. Sebastian almost kills Matt, but Linda drags him to safety.Sarah and Frank find the barely conscious and severely injured Carter. Sarah runs off alone to get blood for a transfusion, despite Frank's wishes. Sensing Sebastian nearby, she splashes the blood all over the room, waiting for him to walk on it and reveal his location. However, Sebastian tackles her and shoots her with her tranquilizer dart, then breaks her neck.Linda and Matt find Frank tending to a dying Carter. Carter bleeds to death and the three go to find Sarah. They find her dead in the walk-in freezer. Frank sprays a fire extinguisher to expose Sebastian, but Sebastian comes from behind and impales Frank with a crowbar. He then stabs Matt with the hook end in his lower chest. Sebastian locks Linda and Matt in the freezer, turns the temperature control all the way down and leaves them to freeze to death.Sebastian puts on his latex mask and clothing, spending much time to ensure he looks near-human. Meanwhile, Linda dresses Matt's wound with duct tape and then works out a way to escape from the freezer. Linda constructs an electromagnet using a defibrillator and other lab equipment, and uses it to open the door. She lights a fire to warm Matt and gathers the parts needed for a flamethrower. In the lab, Sebastian has been making nitroglycerin to destroy the place and cover up the murders of the team. He puts the nitro in a centrifuge, starts a timer and destroys the keyboard, so it can't be stopped. Just as he is entering the elevator to leave, Linda appears and fires her crude blowtorch at him. His latex mask and clothes burning away, Sebastian barely manages to escape the flames. Linda uses the flamethrower to start the ceiling sprinklers, partially revealing him. The two fight; just as she is about to lose, Matt appears and hits Sebastian with the crowbar. Sebastian recovers and seizes the crowbar, but while wet, he swings the crowbar and connects with a fuse box, electrocuting himself. As the electricity courses through his body, Sebastian is rendered partially visible: his muscles, bones, and organs can be seen, but his skin and what's left of his hair remain invisible.Linda and Matt find the nitro about to explode, and decide to abandon the lab, climbing up the elevator shaft. The lab explodes filling the shaft with fire. The two are almost out when Sebastian appears. He fights with Linda, and kisses her one last time ""for old time's sake"" before she finally kills him by grabbing the elevator cable and knocking the car loose, sending Sebastian plummeting into the inferno below. Eventually, both Linda and Matt emerge from the burning laboratory, and medics whisk them away in an ambulance."
Chocolat,2000,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0241303/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A French woman and her young daughter open up a chocolate shop in a small remote village that shakes up the rigid morality of the community. It's early 1959 in a provincial French village, where residents know their place, and if they see something against the unspoken rules, they are to look the other way. The only exception to this rule is the Mayor, le Comte de Reynaud, who is seen as the town's moral authority, even more so than Pere Henri, the new young Catholic priest whose sermons are vetted by le Comte. Literally blowing into town is free spirit Vianne Rocher and her adolescent daughter Anouk Rocher, who move from place to place wherever the north wind takes them. Renting the long empty space that used to house the patisserie, the property owned by elderly Armande Voizin, Vianne instead opens a chocolaterie which none of the residents are aware of until it opens. While Vianne, through the chocolaterie, is able to help certain residents in exposing some of the village's hidden ills, she nonetheless raises the ire of le Comte in almost everything about her being: that she is promoting the indulgence of chocolate in the season of Lent, a period of abstinence and penitence; that she does not attend church; and that she has never been married meaning that Anouk is illegitimate. Vianne is viewed in an even less flattering light when she takes up with Roux, the lead of a band of self-confessed river rats floating into town, he, who like Vianne, is a nomadic free spirit. The questions become who between Vianne and le Comte will outlast the other or come to an understanding of the errors of their ways to be able to live in harmony with the other.—Huggo When single mother Vianne Rocher (Juliette Binoche) and her six-year-old daughter, Anouk (Victoire Thivisol) move to rural France and open a chocolate shop, with Sunday hours, across the street from the local church, they are met with some skepticism. But as soon as they coax the townspeople into enjoying their delicious products, they are warmly welcomed. 1960, small town France. Vianne Rocher (Juliette Binoche) and her young daughter Anouk (Victoire Thivisol) move into town and open a chocolate shop just as Lent is beginning. The town's small-minded Mayor Comte de Reynaud (Alfred Molina) can't accept this and does his best to shut her down, but her warm personality and incredible chocolates manage to win over many townsfolk. Things get shaken up even more when a group of river drifters, led by Roux (Johnny Depp), stop into town (to the even greater distress of the Mayor) and Vianne takes up with him. Meanwhile, she's been helping Josephine Muscat (Lena Olin) out of her abusive marriage, and her equally freethinking landlord, Amande Voizin (Dame Judi Dench), get together with her grandson, Luc Clairmont Aurelien Parent Koenig), whose mother, Caroline (Carrie-Anne Moss), doesn't approve of Amande's ways.—Jon Reeves <jreeves@imdb.com> Vianne Rocher (Juliette Binoche), an expert chocolatier, drifts across Europe with her daughter Anouk (Victoire Thivisol). In the winter of 1959, they travel to a tranquil French village that closely adheres to tradition, as led by the village mayor, Comte Paul de Reynaud (Alfred Molina). Vianne opens a Chocolaterie just as the villagers begin observing the forty days of Lent, much to the chagrin of Reynaud. Vianne, who wears more provocative clothing, does not go to church, and has an illegitimate child, does not fit in well with the town's people, but is nevertheless optimistic about her business. Her friendly and alluring nature begins to win the villagers over one by one, causing Reynaud to openly speak against her for tempting the people during a time of abstinence and self-denial.One of the first to fall under the spell of Vianne and her confections is Armande (Judi Dench), her elderly, eccentric landlady. Armande laments that her cold, devoutly pious daughter Caroline (Carrie-Anne Moss) will not let Armande see her grandson Luc because Caroline thinks Armande is a ""bad influence"". Vianne arranges for Luc and his grandmother to see each other in the chocolaterie, where they develop a close bond. Caroline later reveals to Vianne that her mother is a diabetic, though Armande continues to indulge in the chocolate despite her condition.Vianne also develops a friendship with a troubled woman, Josephine (Lena Olin), who is a victim of brutal beatings by her alcoholic husband Serge (Peter Stormare). After a particularly brutal blow to the head, Josephine leaves her husband and moves in with Vianne and Anouk. As she begins to work at the chocolaterie and Vianne teaches her craft, Josephine becomes a self-confident, changed woman. Under the instruction of Reynaud, Serge seemingly changes into a better man and he asks Josephine to come back to him. Finally happy and fulfilled, Josephine declines. A drunken Serge breaks into the chocolaterie later that night and attempts to attack both women before Josephine, in a moment of empowerment, knocks him out with a skillet.As the rivalry between Vianne and Reynaud worsens, a band of river gypsies camp out on the outskirts of the village. While most of the town objects to their presence, Vianne embraces them, developing a mutual attraction to the gypsy Roux (Johnny Depp). Together they hold a birthday party for Armande with other village members and gypsies on Roux's boat. When Caroline sees Luc, who snuck out to go to the party, dancing with her mother, she begins to see how rigid she is with her son and that his grandmother's influence in his life may not be a bad thing.After the party, Vianne, Josephine, and Anouk all sleep on the boats, where Roux and Vianne make love. Late that night, Serge sets the boat on fire where Josephine and Anouk are sleeping. Both escape unharmed, but Vianne's faith in the village is shaken. Also that night, Luc returns to his grandmother's living room to see that she has succumbed to the complications of her diabetes, devastating both him and his mother. After the fire, Roux packs up and leaves with his group, much to Vianne's sadness.Deciding she cannot win against Reynaud or the strict traditions of the town, Vianne resolves to move to another place. Just before she does so, she goes into her kitchen to see a group of townspeople who have come to love her and the way she has changed their lives, making chocolate for a festival Vianne had planned on Easter Sunday. Realizing that she has brought change to the town, she decides to stay.Despite the shifting sentiment in the town, Reynaud remains staunch in his abstinence from pleasures such as chocolate. On the Saturday evening before Easter, he decides that chocolate is something that will make people stray from their faith in god, so he sneakes into Vianne's house with the idea that he will ruin all of Vianne's preparations for the Easter festival, unfortunately he gives in to the temptation to eat the chocolate and devours the chocolate before collapsing into tears and eventually falling asleep. The next day, Vianne promises not to reveal what happened, and a mutual respect between them is established. Roux returns in the summer to be with her, and despite her constant need for change, Vianne resolves to stay, having found a home for herself and her daughter in the village."

Vertical Limit,2000,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0190865/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A climber must rescue his sister on top of K2, one of the world's biggest mountains. A high-adrenaline tale of young climber Peter Garrett, who must launch a treacherous and extraordinary rescue effort up K2, the world's second-highest peak. Confronting both his own limitations and the awesome power of nature's uncontrollable elements, Peter risks his life to save his sister, Annie, and her summit team in a race against time. The team is trapped in an icy grave at 26,000 feet - a death zone above the vertical limit of endurance where the human body cannot survive for long. Every second counts as Peter enlists the help of a crew of fellow climbers, including eccentric, reclusive mountain man Montgomery Wick, to ascend the chilling might of the world's most feared peak to save her.—Sujit R. Varma Peter Garrett (Chris O'Donnell) caused his father to plummet to his death in order to save his sister's and his own life (following his Dad's orders). He has retired from climbing and is a photographer. Peter's sister Annie (Robin Tunney) has become a renowned mountain climber. Peter happens to show up at base camp as Annie attempts to climb K2 in the Pakistan province of Gilgit-Baltistan, the world's second highest mountain, which is very dangerous to climb because of the tough conditions which await at the summit. The expedition is funded by wealthy industrialist Elliot Vaughn (Bill Paxton) who is also going to climb, with the help of his friend Tom McLaren (Nicholas Lea). There is a huge party the night before the climbers begin the trek. Vaughn is introduced to Peter, whom he asks to accompany them on the trip, but Peter instantly refuses.The climb is a disaster as the winds begin to wreak havoc. Annie, Vaughn, and Tom fall through a patch of ice and become trapped in a crevasse. Annie radios back to base using Morse code and Peter learns of Annie's plight. Due to the seriousness of the cave-in, the rescue party realizes that they may need explosives to blast a hole for a rescue. But the only explosive that they can get their hands on is old nitroglycerin in leaky canisters. Few climbers are willing to consider the trip. Peter manages to assemble a rescue mission with the base's best climbers including brothers Cyril and Malcolm (Le Marquand and Mendelsohn), Monique Aubertine (Izabella Scorupco), Kareem Nazir (Alexander Siddig) and Skip Taylor (Robert Taylor). However, the day before the rescue mission goes underway. Skip and Peter also go visit Montgomery Wick (Scott Glenn), reported to be the world's best climber and foremost expert on K2. Skip is unable to go as Wick says he needs him on the ground directing the mission.The teams pair off: Malcolm and Kareem (much to Malcolm's dismay), Monique and Cyril, and Peter and Wick. They each split up and take different entry points up the mountain with the hope that diversifying their explosives will increase the chances of at least one pair getting through if another has an accident with the unstable Nitro. Cyril constantly ""flirts"" with Monique (much to her dismay). Malcolm and Kareem have awkward conversations which Malcolm points to wanting to complete the mission faster. Monique and Cyril enter trouble when Cyril loses his balance and clings to the side of a cliff. After Monique secures her harness to him, the peak cracks and Monique also falls over the edge and the nitro falls from Cyril's backpack and creates a huge explosion that the other teams notice. Cyril is able to climb back up, however, while he cheers arrogantly lowering a harness for Monique, they both hear a rumbling noise. The explosion and crackling has in fact started an avalanche and is heading straight for Cyril. Cyril, unable to do anything watches and screams helplessly as the avalanches swamps him and subsequently throws him over the edge off the peak. Monique, still hanging onto the edge, manages to survive and get back onto the peak. She then radios in and informs base that Cyril has been killed, but orders them not to tell Malcolm yet.Back at the station, nitroglycerin, used to clear rock formations etc., comes into contact with the sun and reacts and subsequently explodes, completely dumbfounding the crew. Base tell the groups to get their cases of nitroglycerin into the shade to avoid an explosion. Monique teams up with Peter and Wick and they successfully manage to avoid a calamity. Malcolm and Kareem just manage to get the nitroglycerin, but the can containing it leaks and it is exposed to the sun, killing both of them in the explosion. Monique, Wick, and Peter witness the explosion.Meanwhile, underground, Annie begins to suffer from pulmonary edema, when water begins to form inside of the lungs, and she will die unless given medical attention. Tom is in a more severe state, with his leg and ribs broken. Vaughn is the only one unharmed and possesses the medical kit. Annie pleads with him to use Dexamethasone (colloquially referred to in the movie as ""Dex"") to save Tom and herself, but Vaughn declines, unwilling to waste it on a ""lost cause"". More to the fact, Vaughn doesn't want to die and believes he and Annie have the best chance of survival.During the trek the next day, Monique comes across a woman's body frozen in the ice that has been uncovered due to the second explosion. As she gets closer, Wick instantly recognizes the body and tells Monique not to touch her; it is his own wife. After Wick collects a ring and an empty box that contained ""Dex"" from his wife's body, he tells Peter that Elliot Vaughn is responsible for his wife's death. Vaughn's story from his first disastrous climb on K2 detailed that the ""Dex"" was swept away, but Wick's wife always kept it on her person, meaning the empty box proves Vaughn used it for himself.

Hayes Hodges finds his career aspirations dashed when he's wounded in Vietnam. He returns to America and becomes a disillusioned lawyer who goes up against the Service to defend Colonel Terry Childers, who is accused of inciting an incident that leaves many demonstrators dead. Hodges is in no position to decline: Childers saved his life in Vietnam.—Ronos Colonel Terry Childers is a 30-year Marine veteran: a decorated officer with combat experience in Vietnam, Beirut and Desert Storm. But now, the country he served so well has put him on trial for a rescue mission that went terribly wrong. For his attorney, he has chosen Marine Colonel Hayes Hodges, a comrade-in-arms who owes his life to Childers. Hodges is not the best lawyer in the service, but Childers trusts him as a brother Marine who knows what it's like to risk death under fire. Bound by duty and friendship, Hodges reluctantly takes the case, even as he begins to doubt the man who saved his life in Vietnam three decades ago.—Anonymous Colonel Terry Childers is a 30 year career Marine. He is ordered to go to the American Embassy in Yemen, when it's learned that the situation there is starting to unravel. After evacuating the ambassador and his family, Childers orders his men to fire at the crowd because he believes that they are armed. Back in the U.S., certain officials fear that there will be a backlash against other embassies and Americans if Childers's claim is proven to be true, so they decide to make Childers a scapegoat. Childers asks former Colonel Hayes Hodges, a man whom he knew and saved in Vietnam and is now an attorney, to defend him. While there is no evidence or witnesses that can back Childers's claim, Hodges feels that he owes it to Childers to do what he can to defend him.—rcs0411@yahoo.com In 1968, a disastrous American advance in the Vietnam War has Lieutenant Terry Childers (Samuel L. Jackson) executing an unarmed prisoner in order to intimidate a captive North Vietnamese army officer into calling off an ambush of U.S. Marines. His act thereby saves the life of the wounded Lieutenant Hayes Hodges (Tommy Lee Jones), though many of Hodges' men die in the battle.In 1996, now a Colonel, Hodges is about to retire from the Marine Corps and is reminiscing about his years in uniform. As a result of wounds he sustained during Operation Kingfisher, he was no longer able to continue as an infantry officer, so the Marine Corps sent him to law school and he continued his career as a JAG officer. He subsequently enters the Camp Lejeune Officers Club, where numerous Marine officers wait to honor his service at a pre-retirement party. Hosting the event is his old friend, Colonel Terry Childers, who is now the Commanding Officer of a Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU).Subsequently deployed to Southwest Asia as part of an Amphibious Readiness Group, Col Childers and his embarked MEU are called to evacuate the U.S. Ambassador to Yemen from the embassy grounds, as a routine demonstration against American influence on the Arabian peninsula and in the Persian Gulf turns into rock-throwing and sporadic automatic rifle fire by snipers from nearby rooftops. After escorting the Ambassador Mourain (Ben Kingsley) and his family to a waiting helicopter, Childers returns to the embassy to retrieve the American flag; meanwhile three Marines are killed by snipers on nearby rooftops with more gun fire following. Childers then orders his men to open fire on the crowd and ""waste the motherfuckers"", resulting in the deaths of 83 civilian protesters and injuries to over 100 more.Back in the U.S., the U.S. National Security Advisor, Bill Sokal (Bruce Greenwood), pressures the military to proceed with a court-martial to try to deflect negative public opinion about the United States, shouldering all the blame for the incident onto Childers and salvage American relations in the Middle East.Childers subsequently approaches Hodges and asks him to be his defense attorney at the upcoming Court Martial. Hodges is reluctant to accept, knowing that his record as a JAG officer is less than impressive and Childers needs a better lawyer. But Childers is adamant, because he would rather have an attorney who has served in combat.With little time to prepare a defense, Hodges visits Yemen only to find uncooperative government officials and firsthand account of the serious injuries the crowd members endured after encountering hostile civilians. Most of the evidence is stacked against Childers, particularly the fact that no one else in his team can testify to having seen gunfire coming from the crowd, in particular Captain Lee (Blair Underwood) who hesitated to follow Childers' order.Sokal is determined for him to be convicted and is met by the overzealous prosecutor, Major Biggs (Guy Pearce) who believes Childers to be absolutely guilty and wants to make an example out of him. Sokal at one point, burns a videotape of security camera footage revealing that most of the protesting crowd were indeed armed and firing at the Marines; evidence that would potentially exonerate Childers. He also blackmails the ambassador Childers rescued into lying on the stand and saying both that the crowd had been peaceful and that Childers had been violent towards him and his family during the evacuation.Colonel Hodges meets with Mourain's wife after the Ambassador's testimony to hear her side of the story. Although she admits Childers had been valiant, she refuses to testify and destroy her marriage.Back at the trial, Hodges presents a shipping manifest proving that a tape from an undamaged camera which had been looking directly into the crowd-the tape Sokal had burned-had been delivered to Sokal's office, but failed to show up at the trial, arguing that this tape would have been damning evidence against Childers if it had, in fact, shown the crowd was unarmed.Captain Lee is grilled on the witness stand by Major Biggs and despite trying to give favorable testimony, leaves doubt of Childers' innocence.Childers himself eventually takes the stand, with he and Biggs locked into a fierce verbal battle. Biggs produces an audio tape which contains the recording of Childers' poor choice of words when giving his order. While defending his actions, Childers loses his temper while stating that he would not sacrifice the lives of his men to appease the likes of Biggs.Already at an advantage, the prosecution presents the Vietnamese Colonel, who witnessed Childers execute a POW in Vietnam, Colonel Cao, as a rebuttal witness, trying to drive home the idea that Childers is malicious. Hodges cross-examines him and gets him to testify that had the circumstances been reversed, Col. Cao would have done the same thing. After the trial, Hodges visits Sokal and asks him what had happened to the tape; Sokal denies its existence and Hodges replies ""Have you ever had a pissed off Marine on your tail?""The film ends with Childers being found guilty of the minor charge of breach of the peace (for having disobeyed his order to just show his Marines' presence), but not guilty of the more serious charges of conduct unbecoming of an officer (eligible for Dismissal from the Service, similar to a Dishonorable discharge for enlisted personnel) and murder (eligible for life imprisonment, and even the death penalty). A final title card reveals that no further charges were brought against Childers and that he retired honorably from the Marine Corps. The title card also explains that both Sokal and Mourain lost their jobs after being convicted of destruction of evidence and perjury respectively."
The Cell,2000,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0209958/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"An F.B.I. Agent persuades a social worker, who is adept with a new experimental technology, to enter the mind of a comatose serial killer in order to learn where he has hidden his latest kidnap victim. Catharine Deane is a psychotherapist who is part of a revolutionary new treatment which allows her mind to literally enter the mind of her patients. Her experience in this method takes an unexpected turn when an F.B.I. Agent comes to ask for a desperate favor. They had just tracked down a notorious serial killer, Carl Stargher, whose method of operation is to abduct women one at a time and place them in a secret area where they are kept for about forty hours until they are slowly drowned. Unfortunately, the killer has fallen into an irreversible coma which means he cannot confess where he has taken his latest victim before she dies. Now, Catherine Deane must race against time to explore the twisted mind of the killer to get the information she needs, but Stargher's damaged personality poses dangers that threaten to overwhelm her.—Kenneth Chisholm <kchishol@home.com> The story begins with a psychopathic serial killer . when he is with his last victim . The FBI find his house . When they are raided his house, they find him in an eternal coma l But he undergoes an experiment by linking his mind with an expert researcher, and the excitement begins with many dangerous mental interactions. Child psychologist Catherine Deane (Jennifer Lopez) is an expert in an experimental treatment for coma patients: a virtual reality device created by Dr. Henry West (Dylan Baker) that allows her to enter the minds of individuals in a vegetative state and attempt to coax them into consciousness. Her current patient, a boy named Edward (Colton James), seems to be making progress during her sessions with him, but there's no outward sign of improvement in his condition and his parents are beginning to wonder whether Catherine's conversations with Edward might simply be drug-fueled delusions.Far from the research facility, in an underground lair, serial killer Carl Rudolph Stargher (Vincent D'Onofrio) performs the post-mortem ritual on his latest victim. Stargher captures young women, psychologically tortures and drowns them, and then bleaches their corpses completely white. Finally, he clamps a collar around the corpse's neck, making it his possession, a macabre type of doll.Stargher is in the process of stalking and kidnaping his next victim, a woman named Julia Hickson (Tara Subkoff) when the police work of detectives Peter Novak (Vince Vaughn) and Gordon Ramsey (Jake Weber) finally yields a break in the case. The authorities learn the identity of the killer and surround his home. Just before they can finally make the arrest, Stargher suffers a seizure and slips into a coma. Doctors diagnose Stargher with a rare neurological disease that renders his condition irreversible.Meanwhile, Julia wakes up to find herself imprisoned in Stargher's specially designed glass enclosure that is slowly filling with water by means of an automatic timer. It's up to Catherine and Dr. West's team to access the mind of Stargher and persuade him to reveal the location of Julia Hickson in time to save her life. Otherwise, in less than 48 hours, the tank will fill with water and she will drown.Catherine enters Stargher's twisted mind, where she is confronted by the killer's fractured psyche. The boy Carl is too scared to talk, while the adult Stargher rules his inner world like an evil overlord. Another adult version of Carl explains to Catherine that his father abused him and shows her how he began his practice of killing women. Catherine attempts to nurture the innocent side of Stargher's mind, but his murderous half thwarts her at every turn. Eventually the evil Stargher takes control, attacks Catherine and enslaves her mind. Catherine becomes trapped in Stargher's dark dreamscape.Novak volunteers to enter Stargher's mind and attempts to rescue her. He, too is captured by Stargher, but fortunately he manages to remind Catherine that shes dreaming, which breaks her from Stargher's hold. She overpowers Stargher so that they can make an escape. Catherine doesn't manage to get Carl to talk before both she and Peter awaken from the session, but Peter is able to remember a symbol he saw within the dream, a trademark associated with a specialized piece of equipment that leads them to the isolated area where Stargher has built his secret underground room. Novak finds Hickson just in time to save her life.Meanwhile, Catherine decides to reverse the mind link process and pull Stargher's mind into her own to see if she can heal the innocent part of his self. She presents his inner child, Carl, with a paradise, but his murderous side is always present, and manifests as a serpent. This time, however, Catherine has all the power; she attacks the serpent-Stargher, mortally wounding him. Unfortunately, she learns that the two personalities are inextricably linked and the inner child is also dying. Because Stargher's personal mythology equates drowning with being ""saved,"" in the baptismal sense, he dies serenely in the beautiful dream world Catherine created in her mind, his soul finding peace at last as she drowns him in a sparkling pool of water.The use of Dr. West's technology to help the police locate Julia Hickson has given his work new credibility, and Catherine is able to use the reversal technique to bring Edward into her mind, where he will hopefully make new strides with his therapy."
Mission to Mars,2000,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0183523/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"When the first manned mission to Mars meets with a catastrophic and mysterious disaster after reporting an unidentified structure, a rescue mission is launched to investigate the tragedy and bring back any survivors. When a mysterious storm kills all but one crew member of the first manned mission to mars, a rescue mission is launched. Once on the red planet, the crew finds the sole survivor of the first mission who informs them that this was no ordinary storm. It was meant to protect something. But what?—Eric Thal Commander Luke Graham is selected to lead the first manned mission to Mars. Upon setting foot on the red planet, the team discovers an ancient, domelike structure which appears to be a beacon. The dome destroys the team and leaves Luke injured. The recently widowed Jim McConnell leads the rescue mission. When they arrive, they find Luke surprisingly alive, and he has spent the time alone learning the secrets of the mysterious construct. The question now becomes: do they enter the dome and answer humanity's oldest question, perhaps risking their lives in doing so, or return to Earth with what they do know and return in force with equipment and supplies?—Ronos In the year 2020 AD, a mission is launched with the goal of carrying humans to Mars for the first time. The mission's four crew members, upon arriving on the planet, discover a mysterious geologic formation in their vicinity. After transmitting their findings back to the command center on the World Space Station, they head for the site to try and learn more. When they arrive at the formation, they notice a strange sound, which they assume to be interference from their Mars Rover. While attempting to scan the formation with radar, a large vortex forms around the structure, which envelopes and kills two of the mission's crew. A third member was killed when a large rock breaks her visor, exposing her to the Martian atmosphere. Only the mission's commander, Luke Graham (Don Cheadle), survives. The formation also emits an extremely powerful EMP, which irreparably damages much of the electronic equipment on the spacecraft. Despite the damage, Graham manages to upload one transmission to the REMO (REsupply MOdule) orbiting Mars.After receiving Commander Graham's garbled message informing of his crew members' deaths, the Earth command center hastily dispatches another Mars mission. The crew of this new mission includes Commander Woodrow ""Woody"" Blake (Tim Robbins); Co-Commander Jim McConnell (Gary Sinise); and mission specialists Terri Fisher (Connie Nielsen) and Phil Ohlmyer (Jerry O'Connell). The goal of the mission is to investigate the tragedy and bring back any survivors. As the ship is being prepared for its orbital insertion around the red planet, a swarm of micrometeorites collides with the ship and compromises the ship's hull, causing an atmosphere leak. The crew works quickly to repair the hole, troubleshooting where the damage is located, and then using a liquid to help Woody apply the patch. Jim nearly asphyxiates in the incident but survives.Unbeknownst to the crew, the fuel tanks were also damaged, and when they ignite the main engines, the resulting fuel explosion destroys the ship. They quickly don pressure suits and abandon it, hoping to maneuver their way to the REMO. Circumstances are unfavorable, though, as the REMO is moving more quickly (in a slightly lower orbit) than the tethered astronauts. Woody concludes the only hope of a successful rendezvous with the REMO is for him to launch himself directly at it, using the remainder of his jet pack fuel, carrying a line from the others. He successfully attaches the cable to the REMO but is unable to stop himself as he does and floats helplessly away toward the planet. Terri, wanting to save him, decides to cut her line. Woody, not wanting Terri to be harmed, commits suicide by taking off his helmet.When the remaining crew arrive on the red planet, they find Luke, the captain of the first team, still alive. He seems a bit crazed from the isolation and the deaths of his crew but he's able to tell the rescuers about his crew's findings, and informs them that the formation found was the ""face"". He had spent the time alone attempting to learn the secrets of the mysterious structure. He shows the rescue team his most significant clue, a recording of the noise heard in the area of the formation. He had found, after several months of analysis, that the sound was a map of human DNA, in XYZ coordinates.Together, they discover that the mysterious signals are actually a prompt, requiring input of one missing pair of chromosomes which would complete human DNA. The crew dispatches a robot to send the completed signal, at which time an opening appears in the side of the structure. Curious, they venture inside, and are soon sealed in, and discover Earth-like atmospheric conditions. They find a large dark room, and once they step inside, a three-dimensional projection of the solar system appears.A humanoid hologram of a Martian appears, silently explaining that at some time in the distant past, Mars was hit by a ""planet-killer"" asteroid which decimated the Martian ecosystem. The Martians were forced to evacuate their home planet and find other places to settle. During their evacuation, however, they also dispatched elementary life forms of their own to the nearby planet Earth, which at the time of the Martian evacuation, contained no life forms. Over the billions of years following this ""seed-scattering"" (see panspermia), these life forms eventually became the humans who would one day land on Mars and be recognized as the descendants of that ancient Martian experiment. As the image of the Martian fades away, an invitation is offered for one of the astronauts to follow the Martians to one of their new home planets. Jim McConnell decides to go and after their farewells, the rest of the surviving crew head back to Earth. Jim stands in a cylinder that rapidly fills with clear liquid - after a few seconds submerged, he finds that he can breathe the fluid.As the rest of the crew head toward Earth they watch in curiosity as Jim, now inside a Martian craft, races away at speeds hundreds of times faster than their ship into deep space."

As the movie opens, Oz comes down to the kitchen, where his wife, Sophie, and her mother are having breakfast. Sophie tells Oz she needs $5000, but won't say what for. He leaves for work, taking some frustration out on the steering wheel on the way.At the office, we are introduced to his assistant, Jill (Amanda Peet). Jill and Oz have lunch and she tells him that his wife isn't a good person. They joke about having her taken out of the picture, and Jill tells him to name a price. When Oz gets home, a new neighbor is moving in next door. Oz thinks that ""Jimmy Jones"" looks familiar, and after recognizing a tatoo on Jimmy's forearm, realizes that he's Jimmy ""the Tulip"" Tudeski (Bruce Willis). Tudeski is an infamous contract killer from Chicago who has been given amnesty after ratting out Lazlo Gogolak and other members of the Gogolak gang.After an uncomfortable encounter, Oz runs home in a panic and tells Sophie they're moving. But Sophie insists that Oz return to Chicago to collect a finder's fee by giving up Jimmy's wherabouts to Lazlo's son, Janni (Kevin Pollak). Upon arriving in Chicago, Oz has lunch with an old friend and confesses that he has no intention of meeting with Janni. Unfortunately, when Oz returns to his hotel room, he is greeted by Frankie Figs (Michael Clarke Duncan) who turns out to be one of Janni's enforcers. Frankie roughs Oz up to get the truth out of him and then takes him to Janni.At Janni's estate, Oz meets Cynthia (Natasha Henstridge), Jimmy's estranged wife. Janni instructs Frankie to accompany Oz back to Canada and keep an eye on Jimmy until Janni and his men arrive to take him out. Back at the hotel, Oz is freaking out when there's a knock at the door. It's Cynthia. She asks if Oz really knows where to find Jimmy, explaining that Janni and Jimmy both want her (as well as each other) dead in order to collect on $10 million dollars being held in trust in their names. Oz woos Cynthia and the two share a bottle of scotch and end up sleeping together. Then Oz vows to find a way to protect Cynthia from Jimmy.Back in Canada, Frankie and a very nervous Oz enter another hotel room and see Jimmy waiting inside. It turns out that Frankie and Jimmy are old friends and together, are planning to take out Janni and his men (and Cynthia) when they come to do the hit on him. Oz returns to work and tells Jill about the events in Chicago. Jill is extremely excited when she finds out Jimmy the Tulip is Oz's neighbor and makes Oz take her to meet him. Jill tells Jimmy that he's her hero and the reason she wants to be a contract killer. We find out that Sophie tried to use the $5000 to have Jill kill Oz, but Jill ended up liking Oz after getting to know him and refused the contract.As Jimmy and Jill discuss the upcoming ambush, Oz gets angry and says that he won't stand by and let them kill Cynthia. Meanwhile, Sophie is in bed (literally) with a new hitter she has secured with her $5000. Oz is back at home and tries to call and warn Cynthia about Jimmy's plan, but she is already on the way with Janni. When they arrive at Oz's house, Oz gets a chance to warn Cynthia, while she warns him that Janni will kill him after killing Jimmy. The two watch from Oz's garage as Janni's gang walks into the trap.Down the street, Sophie and her hitter are in his car. She is discussing the payment and promises that her mother will pay the remainder of his fee after the job is done. The hitter (played by Harland Williams) is distracted when he recognizes Janni Gogolak heading toward Jimmy's house. When Sophie tells him whose house it is, he realizes what's about to happen, pulls out a gun and exits the car, leaving Sophie bewildered.When Janni enters the house, he is distracted by a naked Jill, and she, Jimmy and Frankie are easily able to kill Janni and his men. Sophie's hitter is in the yard when he hears Oz's car peel out behind him. Oz and Cynthia are making a break for it. This draws Jimmy's attention to the window. He has Jill get the mystery hitter's attention and then shoots him. Sophie sees this and runs, screaming, down the street. When they get the body inside, they realize he is an undercover cop.As they start to get a plan together to dispose of the bodies, Oz calls. While they are on the phone, Jill reveals that Oz slept with Cynthia in Chicago -- which she thinks is great -- but it infuriates Jimmy. Oz makes a deal with them that will benefit everyone. He will alter the cop's teeth to exactly match Jimmy's. They then put the cop's body and Janni's into Oz's car and set it on fire, rendering the bodies unidentifiable, except by dental records. Jimmy is still really mad, but luckily, the plan works. The investigators think that Janni and Jimmy are both dead. This allows Cynthia to collect the $10 million, which as a part of the deal, she has agreed to transfer to Jimmy in exchange for her and Oz's lives. The investigators also find the undercover cop's car when they go to check out Jimmy's house. Inside the car is a tape recorder, the contents of which are more than enough to put Sophie and her mother in prison.The next day, the key players meet up in the city. While Cynthia and Jill go to the bank to transfer the money, Oz heads to an art museum with Jimmy, where they will be around people and Oz thinks he'll be safe. Jimmy has other plans though and takes Oz (along with Frankie Figs) out on a private yacht. Back at the bank, Jill asks Cynthia if she's tempted to take the money and run. Cynthia decides that she loves Oz and can't leave him to be killed by Jimmy. Jill tells Cynthia that Jimmy wants her and Oz to have $1 million as a wedding gift, and the two women make the transfers.On the boat, Jimmy gets the call that the money has been received. He pulls out a gun and points it at Oz. Frankie grins knowingly before Jimmy turns and shoots him instead. Oz is floored, but happy to be alive. He tells Jimmy that it's obvious he's in love with ""her."" Jimmy acts confused, thinking Oz is referring to Cynthia. In the next shot, Jill runs on the boat and jumps into Jimmy's arms. Oz leaves to meet Cynthia. As soon as he sees her, he asks her to marry him. She looks disappointed and asks if Jimmy told him (about the money.) Oz doesn't know what she's talking about, and so she happily agrees to marry him. In the closing scene, the two newlyweds are on a hotel balcony overlooking Niagara falls, dancing to a bluesy version of Ira Gershwin's ""They All Laughed"" as the credits roll."

The Road to El Dorado,2000,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0138749/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Two swindlers get their hands on a map to the fabled city of gold, El Dorado. The story is about two swindlers who get their hands on a map to the fabled city of gold, El Dorado, while pulling off some sort of scam. Their plan goes bad and the rogues end up lost at sea after several misfortunes. Oddly enough, they end up on the shores of El Dorado, and are worshipped by the natives for their foreign appearances.—Paolo Costabel <paolo@bluesky-vifx.com> In the 16th century, Miguel and Tulio are two friends who make a living as con artists and thieves. When the two discover a map to the legendary city of gold El Dorado, they wash ashore in Central America, where they discover the city of gold is real, and its native inhabitants mistake them for visiting gods.—Tom-Daly Spain, 1519. With ruthless Spanish conquistador Hernán Cortés bound for the New World, swindling duo Miguel and Tulio find themselves with a worn-out treasure map and their backs to the wall. And as the two roguish conmen embark on the adventure of a lifetime, lured by the incalculable treasures of the fabled City of Gold, a story about friendship, loyalty, and the wondrous riches of a lost civilisation unfolds. But the bewitching allure of shiny gold and a pressing dilemma stand in the way of a fresh, worry-free start. Is the road to El Dorado paved with greed?—Nick Riganas The story is about two swindlers Miguel and Tulio, two wanted conmen who gets their hands on a map to the fabled city of gold, El Dorado. After they are shipwrecked in the New World with a scene-stealing horse. The pair follow a map to the secret city where their loyalty will be tested: do they return home rich men or continue to live in this paradise? Of course there are some obstacles: a high priest is locked in a power struggle with the benevolent chief and the perfunctory girlfriend puts the two friends at odds. But in the end, they must make a huge moral decision that leads to a swashbuckling conclusion.—Anthony Pereyra {hypersonic91@yahoo.com} The Road to El DoradoThis is an animation and the voice actors are credited. The songs, by Elton John and Tim Rice, are usually known by titles other than their first lines: both are referenced.The movie opens with the legend of the creation of El Dorado, the city of Gold, by the Divinities, a thousand years ago (Song: 'El Dorado, The Magnificent' ('Our glorious city')).In Spain, 1519, Cortez (Jim Cummings) is preparing to set sail. Playing dice with Zaragoza (Tobin Bell), one of his crew - and with loaded dice! - are con-men Tulio (Kevin Kline) and Miguel (Kenneth Branagh), who win a map showing the location of El Dorado, but who are then discovered and, faking an argument between them to distract the crowd, flee: through a set of misadventures involving an escaped bull and a set of narrow streets, they end up inside two water-barrels which are loaded onto Cortez's ship.Discovered at sea, Tulio and Miguel are locked in the brig, but manage to escape with the aid of Altivo, Cortez's horse (Frank Welker), who fetches them the keys in return for an apple. They steal a boat, and (along with Altivo) try to reach land: when they do so, they realize they are at the first marker on the map (a stone shaped like an eagle's head) and so decide to follow the trail to El Dorado (Song: 'The trail that we blaze' ('Look out, New World, here we come'). En route they come across an armadillo, which they save and which accompanies them, and various other markers (the shadow of an eagle, a weeping face, a dragon, etc.) until they come to the final marker, a stone stele bearing an image of the Divinities of El Dorado and their steed, which closely resemble Tulio, Miguel and Altivo.Here Tulio angrily offers 'his half of the big rock' to Miguel: but they are interrupted by a girl, Chel (Rosie Perez), who is running away from El Dorado closely pursued by guards. The guards take everyone by a secret waterway-passage hidden behind the waterfall to the city of El Dorado, where they are met by Chief Tani (Edward James Olmos) and the High Priest, Tzekel-kan (Armand Assante). Hailed as gods (helped by a short start-and-stop of the local volcano) at the coming of the Age of the Jaguar, Tulio and Miguel are taken to their quarters in the temple atop one of the pyramids. Chel, who wants to leave El Dorado, agrees to help them with their scam.The Chief organizes a splendid party for everyone that evening (Song: 'It's good to be a god' ('I hardly think I'm qualified'), which Tulio and Miguel thoroughly enjoy, but they interrupt and stop Tzekel-kan's intended human sacrifice at dawn, also preventing too much of the gold being also tossed into a whirlpool (supposedly the gateway to the spirit realm of Shivalva). The gold is taken to the temple, (there is a cut to Cortez landing and finding the trail), and Tulio and Miguel negotiate a ship from Chief Tani, to be built in three days. At the temple, Tulio is becoming increasingly nervous about the success of the con: he is relaxed by Chel, whilst Miguel sneaks off to see the city (Song: 'The more I learn' (ibid)), where he makes friends with the people. Spotted by Tzekel-kan, Tulio is interviewed by him about how he wants his sacrifices: Tulio and Miguel are then challenged to an Aztec football match, which they win by substituting the armadillo for the ball: however, when offered the sacrifice of the losing team, Miguel reacts angrily, and dismisses Tzekel-kan. The two friends are now drifting apart: Miguel, in an interview with the Chief about the ship, reveals he really wants to stay, and Tulio, increasingly in love with Chel, wants to take her and the gold and leave.Tzekel-kan has however noted that Miguel has cut himself, and 'the gods do not bleed': using a book of magic potions, and the body of his acolyte (Duncan Majoribanks), he brings the giant stone statue of a jaguar to life and under his control. The jaguar pursues Tulio and Miguel across the city and through the volcano to the place of sacrifice above the whirlpool: using a variant of their escape in Spain, Tulio and Miguel trick Tzekel-kan and the jaguar so that both fall into the whirlpool. Tzekel-kan fetches up at the feet of Cortez, and agrees to show him the secret way to the city.In El Dorado, Miguel has decided to stay, and Tulio and Chel to go (Song: 'Friends never say goodbye' ('There isn't much I haven't shared')), and the farewell celebrations and the ship-load of gold are ready when news comes of Cortez's and Tzekel-kan's approach. Tulio decides the only way to save the city is to block the waterway-passage by crashing the ship into its roofs' supporting pillars: to provide extra impetus it is decided to overturn one of the great cisterns near the tunnel entrance. Unfortunately this starts to move faster than expected, and to get the ship clear Miguel has to dive from Altivo's back onto the ship to free the sail. The ship then races down the passage and destroys the roof supports as planned: Miguel, Tulio, Chel and Altivo (and the armadillo) hide to see Tzekel-kan faced with the blocked passage, and Cortez's anger. The guys are saddened at the loss of the treasure - it was SO MUCH GOLD! - but ride off to other adventures, unaware that Altivo still has his gold horseshoes and prefers to keep that fact to himself. (Credits' song: 'Here comes the night' (ibid))."
Men of Honor,2000,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0203019/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The story of Carl Brashear, the first African-American U.S. Navy Diver, and the man who trained him. The story ultimately revolves around two ""men of honor""; their relationship, their individual and joint failures and triumphs. Carl Brashear is determined to be the first African American Navy Diver in a time where racism is rife. Leslie Sunday is his embittered trainer, determined to see him fail. Fate, challenges and circumstances eventually draw these two men together in a tale of turbulence and ultimately triumph.—Filmtwob <webmaster@filmfreak.co.za> Carl Brashear, an enthusiastic dreamer and son of a hard-working and honest Kentucky share-cropper, decides to enlist in the recently desegregated U.S. Navy, in 1948. Thirsting to become the first African-American master diver, the ambitious and driven Carl will let nothing stand between him and his aspirations, not even the ever-present racism and his veteran trainer Master Chief Billy Sunday's intimidations. Undereducated, yet determined to succeed despite the towering obstacles thrown in his way, eventually, Carl will undoubtedly prove his worth, as he finally reaches his goal.—Nick Riganas Carl Brashear, born in 1931 to sharecroppers, joins the Navy and, after watching the heroics of Billy Sunday, the White son of a sharecropper, determines to become the Navy's first African-American diver. At the Bayonne, N.J., divers' training camp, Sunday is his instructor, and Brasher must endure hazing verging on the murderous. With Sunday and the camp's commander dead set against Brashear's graduating, his physical skills and steely determination, which he got from his father, see him through. Carl and Billy's paths cross again when each needs rehabilitation one from an injury, the other from bitterness. Their wives look on with awe and frustration.—<jhailey@hotmail.com> During a time where racism was rampant throughout the entire country. Carl Brashear a young, brash black naval Petty Officer in training is determined to become the very first African-American Navy Diver. This will not be easy for Carl, as a lot of his shipmates and even his trainer Master Chief Billy Sunday wants to see that he fails and quits. It will take all of Carl's strength, endurance and determination to win the respect of his fellow Sailors and make history.—John Wiggins The movie starts off by introducing Master Chief Leslie W. (""Billy"") Sunday (Robert DeNiro), a US Navy Diver, who has recently gone AWOL. He is badly beaten and awaiting disciplinary actions. Sunday and several other Navy members watch TV coverage of an ongoing salvage operation, when Sunday recognizes a familiar face on the screen. One of the other sailors makes some crude racist jokes, Sunday attacks him and applies a choke hold.We then flash back about 25 years, where a young African-American boy named Carl Brashear (Chris Warren Jr.) is watching his father Mac (Carl Lumbly) work the plow on their farm. Carl wants to quit school so that he will be able to help work and then prevent the farm from financial ruin. Mac is dead-set against his son being ""like him"" and stuck working on a farm, but he allows Carl to help.Time passes quickly and a grown-up Carl (Cuba Gooding Jr.) is leaving town to join the Navy. Mac gives his son a custom-built portable radio as a memento of home, and tells Carl to be the best, even if it means breaking the rules.Carl winds up working in the kitchens on the USS Hoist in the South Pacific. He and the other black officers joke about the so-called ""bright future"" the Navy promised them. Their superior points out that black men in the US Navy have only 3 career choices- cook, officer's valet or ""get the f*ck out of the Navy.""Afterwards, Carl and his friends go up on deck where the white officers are swimming (the black crew members are assigned a specific day when they can swim). Carl, tired and hot, decides to jump in the water. The white officers try and chase him down, but Carl out-swims all of them.Carl's actions get him thrown in the brig. The ships' captain meets with Carl and, impressed with the boy's speed, decides to transfer Carl to the search & rescue swimmers, a group assigned to rescue anyone who falls overboard on ship.A few days later, Carl is writing a letter home to his parents when the ship is rocked by an apparent crash. Their mail chopper has accidentally gone down in the ocean. Carl assists the others on deck in raising a Navy Diver from the sea floor with the wounded pilot. The Diver is Master Chief Sunday. Since Sunday is now back up on deck, regulations state that he must now undergo decompression. As the next diver is lowered, an accident with the winch severs the diver's air hose. Chief Sunday prepares to do a dangerous ""bounce dive"" to rescue his fallen ally. One officer, Lt. Cmdr Hanks (David Conrad) orders Sunday not to go, but Sunday disobeys and jumps off ship.Later in the hospital, we see that Chief Sunday was indeed able to save the other diver, but doctors find that he has sustained a severe embolism in both lungs. This condition disqualifies Sunday from any more diving. Upon hearing this news, Sunday throws a fit, destroying some equipment in the hospital, and assaulting several of the staff. Carl is in attendance at the resulting disciplinary hearing, where Sunday is officially disqualified from further diving duty, and assigned to a training position. Carl, having seen Sunday's actions as heroic, is inspired and vows to become a Navy Master Diver.Two years later, Carl is reporting for Diving School, the same diving school where Sunday is the trainer. After a tense confrontation with Chief Sunday, he is allowed in. While most other recruits are revolted by the thought of sharing their bunk with a Negro, one Navy candidate- Snowhill (Michael Rapaport) attempts to befriend Carl. That night, Carl is subjected to severe hazing by Sunday. The following morning, Chief Sunday singles out Snowhill, throwing him out of the program for failing to complete an impossible task. His only ally alienated, Carl is once again on his own.Despite the harsh treatments, Carl performs admirably in his training, assembling machinery and adapting to the diving suit with much greater results than a large number of his classmates. Unfortunately, Carl is falling behind in the academic requirements-scoring only a 37 on his first exam. If he fails again, Carl will be kicked out of the program.One weekend, on leave, Carl comes to a library in the hopes of getting a tutor to help him. He meets a young woman named Jo (Aunjanue Ellis) who is studying medicine. She thinks that Carl cannot possibly succeed, since he has only a 7th grade education. Carl stays the entire night at the library reading and learning more about the Navy program. Next morning, Jo is so impressed by his progress that she agrees to help Carl. The two spend many evenings together, eventually developing a relationship in the process. Soon, Carl is back in the classroom awaiting the results of another test. As the exams are passed out, Carl is elated- he's scored a 76, keeping him in the program.The next day there is a training exercise, involving patching the hole in a sunken ship and raising it to the surface. All at once, the ship accidentally shifts its position, snaring the air hose on one diver while the other flees for his life. Carl volunteers to bring down a new line for the trapped diver, and after several tense seconds, Carl is able to save the young mans' life. Unfortunately, due to the prejudiced environment of the time, the diver who fled earlier receives a medal for his actions while Carl is ignored. Carl is, however, silently thanked by the recruit he saved on his way out of the school.That night, Carl is in town when he meets a young woman (Charlize Theron) who introduces herself as Gwen Sunday, the chief's wife. Gwen takes Carl into the same bar her husband and his fellow divers frequent. Carl and Sunday confront each other, whereby Carl says he knows he's better than Sunday. They face off in a competition using pressurized diving helmets to determine who can hold their breath the longest. The stakes are if Sunday wins, Carl leaves town that very night, but if Carl wins, Chief Sunday must re-admit Snowhill into the diving program. Carl manages to win, but is again overlooked for his actions. Carl sees Jo watching the confrontation with dismay as she storms out of the bar. He gives chase, and she reveals that she's been accepted into an internship and she won't have time to help Carl anymore. Carl, smitten, asks Jo to marry him. Jo contemplates driving off in a taxi, but she returns and accepts.Chief Sunday meets with Captain ""Pappy,"" (Hal Holbrook), the eccentric senior officer at the training school. Chief Sunday states that Carl has scored a 94 on his final test, meaning that all Carl has to do is complete his last training exercise (a timed exercise), and he will have passed all requirements for graduation. Pappy is not at all happy at the prospect of a ""colored diver,"" but Sunday seems hesitant to agree.Sunday confronts Carl yet again. After Carl fires an insult back, Sunday smashes the radio Carl's father gave him. Upon seeing Carl's fury at this, Sunday sees the inscription no the radio ASNF (a son never forgets), and Carl's father's picture by his bed. Sunday asks what his father said to make him try so hard. Carl simply states ""Be the best."" Sunday admits that he is, but that he shouldn't show up the following day because Pappy will not let him pass the school. Carl is furious.Next morning, Chief Sunday explains the final exercise to the recruits- they must assemble a flange underwater, pieces are on the river bottom and tools will be provided once the parts are found. They will earn points based on the speed of their work, but there is no set time limit and air will be provided to the diving suits for as long as the divers can stand the cold water. Carl makes a defiant entrance to the exercise, and is looked upon with a measure of respect from the other recruits finally.Carl is among the first to find the parts for his project, but when he calls up for tools the attendants cut a hole in the tool bag sending them cascading all over the river bottom. Carl frantically searches for all the necessary parts.As time goes by, the recruits slowly but surely complete the assignment. Carl remains in the water well into the night. The other recruits, having showered and put on warm clothes, have returned to see Carl finish. Pappy orders Sunday to leave Carl in the water until he stops moving. Sunday, however, decides that too much time has passed already and gives the order to bring Carl back up. This makes Sunday's colleagues uneasy, as it violates a direct order from Pappy. The other recruits step up, but just as they begin to haul in the lines, Carl's project flange comes to the surface, completed. After 9 hours and 31 minutes in the excruciatingly cold water, Carl Brashear has passed his final and essentially graduated with honors from Diving School.As Carl leaves the barracks next day, Snowhill runs in to talk to him. He has been asked to rejoin the diving program. He also states that Pappy has thrown Sunday out of the school as trainer. Carl also finds his father's radio, fully repaired, with ""A son never forgets"" freshly carved into the side.Some time later, Carl and his wife are in a nightclub. Carl orders champagne as a celebration because he's been offered a job with Brooklyn Navy Yard. Carl doesn't know if he should accept the job, since he won't move up in rank as just a stand-by diver. Jo confesses that she is three months late, and Carl is suddenly overjoyed at the prospect of being a father.At a New Years' party, Sunday and his wife run into Lt. Hanks- the man who ended Sunday's diving career. Despite his best efforts to remain civil, Sunday ends up attacking the lieutenant. Charges are filed against Sunday for assaulting a superior officer, and he suffers a rank reduction.The scene then shifts back to Chief Sunday watching a TV report explaining the current salvage operations. Earlier that day, an American B-52 bomber crashed in Spain. Before impact, it released its payload of three 50-megaton warheads on parachutes. Two have been recovered but the last one is lost at sea. Furthermore, maritime law dictates that since the bomb vanished in international waters, whoever finds it first will be considered the true owner. So the US Divers are racing against Russian submarines to be the first to find the missing nuke.Carl is one of several divers assigned to try and find the missing bomb. At one point, Carl finds a metal object on the sea floor but it turns out to be a mere Coke can. At that moment, sonar signals in the water are detected- there is a Russian submarine is Carls' immediate vicinity. Carl spots the sub and tries to run for cover, but his air line is caught by the sub and he is dragged along the ocean floor. After several tense seconds, Carl is able to contact the surface and tell them that he is unhurt. As they prepare to bring him home, Carl notices a large metal object nearby. The sub's movement has caused most of the silt and debris on the ocean floor to move aside, essentially finding the nuke for them!Back on deck, Carl watches as the bomb is brought on board. An accident with the winch on deck causes the lines holding the bomb to snap. Carl shoves several other deck hands aside, but his own leg is caught by the snapped wire.Carl wakes up later in a hospital, with Jo by his side. Jo explains that Carl's leg was nearly severed by the impact, but doctors think he will walk again. Carl realizes that this injury has put an end to his diving career and he is devastated.Meanwhile, Chief Sunday has fallen on hard times since his rank reduction. He is now in a rehab clinic undergoing detox for alcoholism. With the support of his wife, Sunday gets back on his feet. He recognizes Carl from a news story about the accident.Carl is still in the hospital, he is reading a news story that was sent to him (presumably by Sunday) about amputee pilots being able to return to duty. He speaks with his superiors (including the now-Captain Hanks). Carl wants to return to full diving duty, but they feel that it is impossible in his current state. Carl voices his desire to have the damaged leg amputated and return after a fitting with a prosthesis. Jo is furious about Carl's reckless and apparently selfish attitude, and walks out.Later, Carl's leg is indeed amputated. He begins the difficult process of learning to move and act with a prosthetic. Chief Sunday shows up and asks if he can help Carl. Sunday begins training him again, and makes a deal with Captain Hanks. He will get four weeks to complete training Carl before a medical hearing with the Chief of Naval Personnel in Washington. Hanks agrees, on the condition that Sunday take immediate retirement if and when Carl fails to return to duty.A month later, Carl appears before the Naval Personnel and they discuss his possible return. Chief Sunday has been ordered to wait outside the courtroom by Captain Hanks. Captain Hanks outlines a new requirement for Navy Divers- a new diving suit, weighing in at 290 pounds has been approved for use and anyone wanting to use it must take 12 steps unassisted. Carl, seeing that Jo and his son are in the audience, volunteers to take the 12 steps right then and there. Chief Sunday bursts into the courtroom. He is asked to leave by Hanks, but after introducing himself to some of the more senior members of the court who know of his past heroics, is allowed to stay.Chief Sunday helps Carl suit up, and then proceeds to coach him through the ordeal. Carl stands up in the new suit, and-with obvious great discomfort- takes a few clumsy steps forward. Everyone assumes that his prosthetic will snap, and as he nears failure he is ordered to stand down by Captain Hanks. Sunday orders Carl to disregard, as he is the officer in charge of this exercise. He begins shouting orders at Carl (identical to their first session at diving school years before). Carl struggles, but keeps moving forward until he has reached the twelfth step.Captain Hanks, realizing that no more can be done to prevent Carl from succeeding, announces that the Navy will be reinstating Carl Brashear to full diving duty.Carl and Sunday salute one another, and Sunday marches out of the courtroom.Text at the end reveals that in 1968, Carl Brashear was the first African-American amputee to assume Navy diving duty, and that two years after his reinstatement Carl was promoted to Master Chief. Carl continued in his Naval career for another nine years before finally taking retirement."

Roommates Jesse and Chester, both who have more than just a few cards short of a full deck, are stoner dudes who don't even do their jobs as pizza delivery guys well. They awaken one morning having little recollection of what they did the previous night, due to being wasted. They discover that their kitchen is full of prepackaged pudding, how they got all the pudding they are unaware. From a telephone message they receive, they come to the realization that at some point during the previous night they were at a party at the house of their girlfriends, twins Wanda and Wilma, and that today is their one year anniversary, which they did remember as they already bought the twins gifts. But the worst thing in not remembering what happened last night is that Jesse's car is missing. In trying to find out what happened to the car, they believe they have to recreate the feeling and mindset of last night, meaning getting wasted all over again. In trying to find the car, they, being the types that area easily distracted, get sidetracked by one item after another, most specifically the potential of having sex with hot babes (sex with which Wanda and Wilma have not yet provided them), and learning that they apparently had a suitcase filled with $200,000 last night, the suitcase and therefore the money to which they don't know what happened. During their day of discovery, they also end up encountering one group of alien wannabes, and two groups of actual aliens, all three groups who are after the continuum transfunctioner which they believe Jesse and Chester have. Jesse and Chester don't know where it is let alone what it is, but these three groups seem to be willing to do whatever necessary to get it from Jesse and Chester.

All Pierre was able to recover was a locker key from a locker at Captain Stu's Space-O-Rama, a local miniature golf course and video arcade.As nightfall arrives, Jesse and Chester arrive at the Space-O-Rama and find a stash of cool stuff in the locker, including Captain Stu tickets, a cool straw, and the suitcase full of money. Tania and her transsexual boyfriend, Patty, show up and take the money. Jesse and Chester use the Captain Stu tickets to buy a fake Continuum Transfunctioner. They then call Zoltan and Tommy claiming that they have the Continuum Transfunctioner. Zoltan shows up and trades The Twins for the fake Transfunctioner. Just then, Tommy shows up and steals the fake Transfunctioner and lets Nelson free. The five Hot Chicks and the two Nordic Dudes show up, both claiming to be the Keepers of the Continuum Transfunctioner. Even Christie Boner shows up and has a quick meeting of the minds with Nelson, while Jesse and Chester's boss, also shows up with pizza after Chester anonymously called requesting pizza.Just then, Chester finally solves the Rubik's Cube (which he has been working on the entire time since finding it in his colored suit) which suddenly glows and morphs into a strange silver-painted globe and it is revealed to be the Continuum Transfunctioner. The Transfunctioner is now activated and will destroy the universe unless the true Keepers can turn it off. Jesse and Chester decide who the real Keepers are by asking a question about the 18th hole of putt-putt the night before. Only the real Keepers know that they won a lifetime supply of pudding by getting a hole in one. The two alien Nordic dudes answer correctly and are given back the Transfunctioner which they deactivate.The universe is saved until the Hot Chicks scream with rage and morph into a ""Super Hot Giant Alien Chick"" and go after the Continuum Transfunctioner. The Nordic Dudes attempt to use the device to banish the giant to Hoboken, New Jersey, only to get flung aside, and the Transfunctioner lands in Jesse's hands. The Giant Alien Chick then eats Tommy, while Christie reacts with indifference. Jesse and Chester are forced to run outside in the putt-putt golf course and the Giant Chick follows them. Jesse and Chester must activate the Photon Accelerator Annihilation Beam to destroy her. Chester once again saves the day thanks to his love of Animal Planet by using a straw as a tool to push the button. Tommy however is still alive when he gets blown out of the giant alien chick's body.Christie falls in love with Nelson. The Nordic Dudes take the space nerds to a party on the Crab Nebula. Everyone's memory is erased by the Nordic Dudes as they use the Continuum Transfuctioner to reverse time to the very beginning of the movie.In the morning, Jesse and Chester can't remember the night before, but at least they find the car outside (which was hidden behind a mail truck this whole time) and drive to The Twins house where they exchange gifts and receive a special gift from the Keepers of the Continuum Transfunctioner. They get in the car to drive and get some Chinese Foooood."
The Tigger Movie,2000,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0220099/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Tigger goes looking through the hundred-acre-wood to find his family. Tigger searches through the Hundred Acre Wood for somebody to bounce with him, but all of his friends are too busy getting ready for the coming winter. While he searches for a playmate, Tigger accidentally destroys Eeyore's house with a boulder. He later wrecks the complex pulley system that Rabbit has rigged up to remove the boulder and sends his friends flying into a mud puddle. Rabbit is furious at Tigger for destroying his Rock Remover, and the rest of Tigger's friends admit they're not quite as bouncy as he is because they aren't Tiggers. Tigger sadly wanders off on his own, wishing there was somebody else like him.Roo, who wants to play with Tigger, catches up to him and asks if Tigger has a Tigger family he could bounce with. Tigger is fascinated by the idea and the two go to visit Owl for advice on finding Tigger's family. Owl shows them portraits of his own family and mentions the concept of family trees. Tigger accidentally knocks the portraits over. When he quickly hangs them back up, all of owl's ancestors appear to be perched on a single tree. Tigger concludes that his family tree must be a real tree and he and Roo go searching for it.After searching the wood without turning up any giant, Tigger-striped trees, Tigger and Roo go back to Tigger's house to search for clues to his family's whereabouts. They find a heart-shaped locket that Tigger hopes will contain a picture of his family, but it is empty. Roo suggests that Tigger try writing a letter to his family, which Tigger does.During this scene, Tigger teaches Roo the awesome Whoop-De-Dooper-Loop-De-Looper-Alley-Ooper Bounce.When Tigger's letter gets no response, Roo gathers Tigger's friends together to write him a letter.

Tigger's friends don't have the heart to tell Tigger that the letter is from them, so they disguise themselves as Tiggers and attend his family reunion. Rabbit does not join in, but, rather, berates them for not getting ready for the approaching winter storm and slams off.Tigger is completely taken in by the costumes until Roo attempts Tigger's complex Whoop-De-Dooper-Loop-De-Looper-Alley-Ooper Bounce, crashes into the closet and knocks his mask off.

They find Tigger sitting in a large tree with patches of snow on the trunk that resemble stripes. Rabbit insists that Tigger come home, but Tigger refuses to leave his ""family tree"" until his Tigger family returns. They argue and Tigger's shouting causes an avalanche. Tigger bounces all of his friends to safety in the tree branches, but is swept away by the snow himself. Roo performs a perfect Whoop-De-Dooper-Loop-De-Looper-Alley-Ooper Bounce and rescues Tigger.When the avalanche subsides, Tigger realizes he has lost the letter from his family.

"O Brother, Where Art Thou?",2000,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0190590/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"In the deep south during the 1930s, three escaped convicts search for hidden treasure while a relentless lawman pursues them. Loosely based on Homer's ""Odyssey,"" the movie deals with the picaresque adventures of Ulysses Everett McGill and his companions Delmar and Pete in 1930s Mississippi. Sprung from a chain gang and trying to reach Everett's home to recover the buried loot of a bank heist they are confronted by a series of strange characters--among them sirens, a cyclops, bank robber George ""Baby Face"" Nelson (very annoyed by that nickname), a campaigning governor and his opponent, a KKK lynch mob, and a blind prophet who warns the trio that ""the treasure you seek shall not be the treasure you find.""—Armin Ortmann <armin@sfb288.math.tu-berlin.de> Mississippi, 1937. Three convicts escape from a jail chain-gang intent on getting to the loot stashed away by one of them. As this is at his house soon to be flooded by a new dam, speed is of the essence. They find themselves fast-talking their way out of one jam after another, and along the way not only have to be wary of riverside sirens but even get to make a pretty good country record.—Jeremy Perkins {J-26} Ulysses Everett McGill (George Clooney), a suave, fast-taking convict, escapes from incarceration at a chain gang in rural Mississippi in 1937 during the Great Depression. He is chained to two other prisoners, slow-witted Delmar (Tim Blake Neslon) and hot-tempered Pete (John Turturro), so the three must escape together. Everett convinces them that he has hidden $1.2 million after robbing an armored car, and promises to split it with them. They hitch a ride with an elderly blind man on a railway handcar, and he foretells that they will indeed find a treasure, though it may not be the one they seek.They travel on foot to visit Pete's cousin, Washington Hogwallop, who removes their shackles, gives them new clothes, and allows them to sleep in his barn for the night. However, the trio is awakened by the authorities, led by the partly-blinded World War I veteran Sheriff Cooley (Daniel Von Bargen) after Hogwallop had turned them in for the reward. The barn is set ablaze, but Everett, Pete, and Delmar escape with the help of Hogwallop's rambunctious young son (who drives them out of the fiery barn in a car).They continue their journey, and encounter a religious congregation in the midst of a mass baptism. Pete and Delmar are drawn in and are baptized as well, but Everett resists. They later pick up a hitchhiking young black guitarist, named Tommy Johnson (Chris Thomas King), who claims he sold his soul to the devil in exchange for musical talent. They hear that the nearby WEZY radio station pays people to sing into a can, so they pay a visit to the blind disc jockey (Stephen Root), and sing a version of ""Man of Constant Sorrow"" with Tommy accompanying them. Calling themselves 'The Soggy Bottom Boys', they are paid $40 in cash and leave satisfied. However, unbeknownst to them, their record becomes wildly popular around the state, with no one knowing the identity of the band.That night, the shadowy Sheriff Cooley and police track them down and find their car near their campsite. Everett, Pete, and Delmar part ways with Tommy as they escape. The next day, they meet famed robber George 'Babyface' Nelson (Michael Badalucco), on the run from police, and accompany him in robbing a bank. After spending the night at a campsite, Babyface gives them a share of the stolen loot and departs.The trio encounters three sirens: beautiful women washing clothes in the river, and are seduced by them. Delmar and Everett discover the next morning that Pete has disappeared, and Delmar believes the women had turned him into a toad (which was found in Pete's abandoned clothes). Carrying ""Pete"" in a shoe box, Delmar and Everett go to a restaurant for breakfast where they meet Big Dan Teague (John Goodman), a one-eyed Bible salesman. Thinking that their box contains money, Big Dan lures them to a field for an advanced tutorial on salesmanship. He violently beats the two men, kills the toad after finding no cash, and steals their car and what money they have on them.Bruised and defeated, Everett and Delmar arrive at Everett's hometown, where he attempts to speak to his estranged wife, Penny (Holly Hunter), mother of his seven daughters. He finds that Penny is engaged to Vernon T. Waldrip, the campaign manager for Homer Stokes (Wayne Duvall), who is running for governor against the grouchy elderly incumbent, Pappy O'Daniel (Charles Durning). Penny refuses to take Everett back, and was so ashamed of his arrest that she told their daughters he was hit by a train and killed.Rejected, Everett and Delmar attend a movie, where a prison chain gang is in the audience. Pete, it turns out, was turned into the police by the Sirens, and is once again in chains. In the theater, Pete advises his friends to abandon their quest, as it is a ""bushwhack.""That night, Everett and Delmar stealthily break him out of jail. Pete tearfully confesses that, after threatened with death by the authorities, he revealed their plans to find the armored car loot for Sheriff Cooley, whom they finally learn is the one who has been hunting them across the state. However, Everett reveals that he fabricated the story to entice Pete and Delmar to escape with him. Everett had truthfully been arrested for practicing law without a license, and was determined to escape when he heard his wife planned to remarry. If caught, the trio could face an additional 50 years in jail. An enraged Pete tackles Everett.The three stumble upon a Ku Klux Klan rally in a nearby field. Shocked, they see that Tommy Johnson has been captured and that the Klan is preparing to hang him. The trio disguise themselves as color guard members and attempt to rescue Tommy, but are confronted by Big Dan Teague, a member in attendance. The red-robed Grand Wizard, it so happens, is candidate for governor Homer Stokes. After a scuffle, Everett, Pete, and Delmar topple a huge fiery crucifix onto Big Dan, presumably killing him, and escape with Tommy.The four men arrive at a campaign dinner, disguised by long false beards. Pretending to be the hired band, they slip onstage and entertain (Delmar sings an impressive version of ""In the Jailhouse Now"") while Everett attempts to speak to Penny again. When the men launch into ""Man of Constant Sorrow"", they watch in awe as the entire audience rises to its feet and cheers, recognizing them as the elusive Soggy Bottom Boys. However, Homer Stokes arrives and tries to reveal them as the men who disrupted the lynch mob in performance of its duties. The townspeople are outraged at Homer's confessed racism, and literally ride him out on a rail. Everett, Pete, Delmar, and Tommy resume playing, and a delighted (and victorious) Pappy O'Daniel joins them onstage and grants them an official pardon. After the event, Penny takes Everett back, but demands that he return to their old cabin and retrieve her wedding ring. The four men depart quickly, as the cabin is in the valley that is due to be flooded the following day. They briefly see Babyface Nelson again, re-captured by police, but in extremely high spirits, happy at the thought of being executed in the electric chair.The men arrive at the cabin the next morning, but to their horror find that Sheriff Cooley and his posse have caught up with them and his men have already dug their graves. As the authorities loop nooses over a tree branch, Everett drops to his knees and prays that he might see his daughters again. At that moment, the valley is flooded. The cabin is destroyed, and Everett, Pete, Delmar, and Tommy surface on the newly-made lake. They retrieve the sought-after ring from a floating roll top desk, and return to town.Shortly afterwards, Everett is happily reunited with Penny and his children. The family is taking a walk through the town when Penny remarks that the ring Everett brought her is the wrong one. She firmly asserts to a frustrated Everett that he must find the original ring (now at the bottom of a lake). Their daughters sing the hymn Angel Band as they cross paths with the elderly handcar operator who had predicted Everett's fate."
Frequency,2000,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0186151/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"An accidental cross-time radio link connects father and son across 30 years. The son tries to save his father's life, but then must fix the consequences. A rare atmospheric phenomenon allows a New York City firefighter to communicate with his son 30 years in the future via HAM radio. The son uses this opportunity to warn the father of his impending death in a warehouse fire, and manages to save his life. However, what he does not realize is that changing history has triggered a new set of tragic events, including the murder of his mother. The two men must now work together, 30 years apart, to find the murderer before he strikes so that they can change history--again.—<jgp3553@excite.com> Thirty-six year old homicide detective John Sullivan lives in the same Queens, New York house in which he grew up with his firefighter father Frank Sullivan and nurse mother Julia Sullivan. Frank died on October 12, 1969 (when John was only six) on duty in a warehouse fire. Despite Frank dying when John was so young, John remembers his father well as he has a keepsake book of photos and news clippings about Frank, who was a huge Mets fan. Almost thirty years to the day of Frank's death, John finds Frank's old ham radio, which Frank used to use all the time to speak to people around the world. A discussion about the 1969 World Series with the first person he makes contact with on the radio makes John ultimately come to the realization that he is speaking to his father who is using the exact same ham radio and sitting at the exact same desk in the exact same house exactly thirty years earlier. Although they don't know the reason for being able to contact each other, John tries to use whatever knowledge he has to help his father, especially in averting the cause of his death. But John and Frank learn that knowledge is a powerful tool which can result in both good and bad as John works on a ""new"" thirty year old on-going case of murdered nurses, the case coined the ""Nightingale murders"" which has a personal connection to the Sullivan family.—Huggo John Sullivan (Caviezel) is a New York City homicide officer who is traumatized for 30 years following the death of his father, Frank (Quaid), After finding Frank's HAM radio, John begins talking to Frank, 30 years into the future. Together, they change the past but have to find a way to stop a serial killer from murdering John's Mom & Frank's wife with a 30 year gap.—Ryan Harder <hotshotharder@hotmail.com> It is October 1969. Frank Sullivan is a New York City firefighter, and a devoted husband and father. His wife, Julia, is a nurse who works at a local hospital. His son, John, is six years old; Frank calls him Little Chief. They share a passion for baseball, especially the Amazing Mets, and plan to watch the 1969 World Series together on TV. Frank's best friend is an African-American cop named Satch; John's is a boy his own age named Gordo. When not fighting fires and spending time with his family, Frank's hobby is ham radio.Fast-forward to October 1999. John is now a New York City policeman; Satch is either his supervisor or his partner. Gordo is still his best friend, but is now married. John is still single, and his girlfriend, Samantha, has just walked out on him. He still lives in the family home in Queens; his mother lives nearby and still works as a nurse, but his father has been dead for 30 years, killed while fighting a warehouse fire. The thirtieth anniversary of that tragedy is coming up, and Julie, Satch, and Gordo are all aware of how hard that is on John.John and Satch are currently occupied with a case called the Nightingale murders, where three nurses were murdered by a serial killer in 1968 and 1969. The case was never solved, but one of the bodies has just been found, and the investigation has been reopened. As part of the investigation, John visits and interviews an elderly couple, Mr. and Mrs. Sheppard, who live near where the body was discovered. Mrs. Sheppard is a retired nurse. Mr. & Mrs. Sheppard had a son, named Jack. Jack was a New York City Detective. 30 years ago, Jack died at a hospital.While Gordo and his family are visiting, they find Frank's old ham radio and set it up. After Gordo and crew leave, John begins to try out the radio, and through a strange atmospheric phenomenon, contacts his father thirty years in the past. Both are skeptical at first; John thinks it is Gordo playing a joke, while Frank thinks it is someone planning to do his family harm and becomes somewhat angry. John is the first to realize that he is actually talking to his father through time, and tries unsuccessfully to convince him. In the process, he describes the outcome of the first World Series game, which in Frank's time is to take place the next day. He also warns him that he is about to die in a warehouse fire, gives the name of the warehouse, and tells him that he died because he followed his instincts, but if he had gone the other way he would have made it.Afterwards, Frank remains skeptical, but he can't help but notice the next day that the World Series game goes exactly as the man purporting to be his son said it would. Then he is called to a fire, and it turns out to be exactly the same warehouse in which the man purporting to be his son said he died. Trapped on the top floor of the inferno, he is trying to take what seems to be the only sensible escape route, when he remembers John's words that if he had gone the other way he would have made it. He turns around and goes the opposite way, and survives.Back in 1999, John is out drinking with Satch and Gordo, who are trying to help him get through the difficult thirtieth anniversary. John begins to have a muddle of conflicting memories, including those of later childhood and adolescence and even his early years on the police force, with his father there. He tells his friends, as though realizing it for the first time (which he is), that his father didn't die in a fire. They look at him incredulously; they all know that Frank died of lung cancer just ten years ago in 1989.John discovers that he has two sets of memories. He can remember life with his father subsequent to the fire, but he also remembers what life was like when he believed that his father had been killed thirty years before. This is not true of anyone else. Satch and Gordo, for example, have changed instantly, suddenly having no recollection of Frank having died in a fire; it is as though they have always known that he lived another twenty years and died ten years ago.Later that evening, John makes contact with his father again. This time there is no skepticism on Frank's part, and they spend some time getting reacquainted. Later, Frank, excited just to be alive, visits Julia at the hospital. While they are talking, she spots the doctor about to administer medication to a patient to whom she had given different medication earlier, points out his error, and Julia saves Jack Sheppard's life.That night (in 1999), John is haunted by still another set of new memories, this time of attending a funeral with his father, without his mother. The next day he discovers that his mother simply does not exist anymore. At work, the Nightingale case suddenly involves ten victims instead of three (Satch cannot understand why John would think it had ever been just three), and John discovers to his horror that one of the victims was his mother. Julia was the sixth woman, who got killed by the Nightingale Killer.John tells Frank that Julia died 30 years ago. Since Julia was working at the hospital last night, John says that Julia wasn't supposed to be at the hospital last night. If Frank died in the Warehouse fire last night, then Julia wouldn't have been at the hospital last night.John says, ""Dad, you need to stop the Nightingale Killer from killing the other women including mom.""Their hope is that Frank, armed with details of each murder before it happens, will be able to prevent the murders and catch the killer. John gives Frank the information about the 4th woman/victim, who got killed by the Nightingale Killer. Frank goes to a bar, strikes up a conversation with the 4th victim and effectively keeps her from leaving & it means that the 4th victim doesn't die.John realizes that the Nightingale Killer killed 9 women only.John gives Frank the information about the 4th woman, who got killed by the Nightingale Killer. The 5th victim's in a bar. Frank's also at the same bar. While Frank's in the bathroom, Jack comes into the bathroom & Jack attacks Frank. Frank doesn't know that the man's name is Jack Sheppard. It's revealed that the Nightingale Killer's Jack. Jack knocks out Frank. Jack steals Frank's license. When Frank wakes up, Frank goes to the 5th victim's apartment & Frank realizes that the woman's dead.Frank explains to John what has happened, and John tells him to hide the wallet in a place where it won't be discovered for thirty years. As soon as Frank hides it, John retrieves it. Later he is able to match the fingerprints with Jack Sheppard. John doesn't tell anyone that the Nightingale Killer's none other than Jack Sheppard.If Frank died in the warehouse fire 30 years ago, then Julia would've left the hospital and Jack would've died at the hospital. If Jack died at the hospital, then Jack wouldn't have been able to kill more than three women. Since Frank didn't die in the warehouse fire, Julia stayed at the hospital and Julia saved Jack's life. Even though Frank didn't die in the warehouse fire, John wishes that Jack still died at the hospital.John pays another visit to the Sheppards. Mr. Shepard is alive. Mrs. Sheppard was murdered by the Nightingale Killer 30 years ago. Mrs. Sheppard was the last woman, who got killed by the Nightingale Killer. Jack doing private investigation, having left the police force after being involved with some corruption. John finds the present-day Jack Shepard in a bar, and tells him cryptically that he is going down, thirty years ago.When John tells Frank that the Nightingale Killer's Jack Sheppard, Satch shows up at Frank's house in 1969. Satch tells Frank that Frank's license was at the Nightingale Killer's 4th victim's apartment. Satch reluctantly arrests Frank for the Killer's 4th victim's murder. When Frank & Satch are inside the Interrogation Room, Satch doesn't believe that Frank was using his ham radio to contact John who's in the Future. Frank predicts some details of the current game which is part of 1969 World Series. Satch leaves Frank in his cell and goes to talk to Julia. Satch & Julia go to another place where people drink coffee. Frank's shocked when Jack enters the Interrogation Room. When Satch's partner enters the Interrogation Room, Jack & Satch's partner leave the Interrogation Room. Satch's partner is wondering why Jack entered the Interrogation Room. Jack says, ""I entered the Interrogation Room because I thought that you needed some help."" Frank plans to electrocute Jack when Jack comes back to the Interrogation Room.When Jack returns, Frank electrocutes Jack. Jack's unconscious. Frank also knocking out all the electricity in the police station. Frank then starts a fire which activates the building's sprinkler system. Frank steals Jack's license. As everyone flees the building, and with Jack lying face-down in a pool of water, Frank is able to calmly leave the cell. Jack never closed the door. Frank steals the file that has evidence against Frank. Frank calmly leaves the Police Station. Satch says, ""Frank's saying that he was using his radio to contact John who's in the Future."" Julia doesn't believe that Frank was using his radio to contact John, who's in the Future. Satch sees the Current 1969 World Series Game going exactly as Frank predicted it would.Frank breaks into Jack's apartment. Inside Jack's apartment, Frank discovers pictures of the Nightingale victims & Frank also discovers jewelry that belongs to the Nightingale Victims. Jack comes back to his apartment. When Jack sees Frank, Jack tries to shoot Frank but Frank manages to escape. While Jack's chasing Frank, Satch & his partner go to Jack's apartment. Satch & his partner discover the pictures & jewelry of the Nightingale Victims. Jack chases Frank to the waterfront. At the waterfront, Frank surprises Jack. Frank wants to drown Jack. When Frank gets out of the water, Satch & Satch's partner show up. They're unable to find Jack's dead body. Frank, Satch, & the other people still believe that Jack's dead.Back at home, Frank contacts John again. Frank tells John that Jack died, but Julia still died in 1969. Unfortunately, a mysterious man knocks out John. It's revealed that John was knocked out by Jack. In 1969, Jack must've figured out that someone in the future gave Frank the information about the Nightingale Murders. Before Jack knocked out John, Jack realized that Frank's wife gave birth to John & Jack also realized that John gave Frank the information about the Nightingale Murders. Jack knocks out Frank. Jack handcuffs Frank. Jack is holding a gun & Jack throws away John's gun. John wakes up & John gets into a wrestling match with Jack. Jack sneaks into Julia's room. Julia wakes up, but Jack tries to strangle Julia. When Frank wakes up, Frank hears Julia's voice & Frank realizes that Jack's still alive. Frank frees himself. When John sees Jack in Julia's room, Jack knocks out Julia.Frank owns a shotgun. When Frank grabs his shotgun, Frank sees Jack holding John as a hostage.Jack says, ""If you drop your weapon, then I'll let go of your son.""When Jack grabs John's gun, Jack is about to kill John. Frank drops his shotgun. Few seconds later, Julia jumps onto Jack & Jack lets go of John. Jack pushes Julia & Julia falls onto the ground. When Frank grabs his shotgun, Frank shoots Jack's right hand. Jack's right hand gets blown off & Jack leaves Frank's house. When Jack's using his right hand to choke John, Jack's right hand disappears. While Jack's hand's disappearing, Jack backs away in horror, but Jack still keeps John's gun pointed at John. After Jack's hand disappears, Jack sees Frank holding his shotgun. Jack's about to shoot Frank, but Frank shoots Jack in self-defense. Jack's dead. John realizes that Frank's alive because Frank stopped smoking 30 years ago. Father Frank and son John, now both in 1999, joyfully have the first hug of their reunion.The movie ends with John and Frank (in 1999) playing baseball together as Julia looks on. Since Frank stopped smoking 30 years ago, something prevented John's girlfriend from breaking up with John. John's wife gave birth to a boy. John's son's age is between 3 & 10."

They're accepted because the other people trying out are terrible (Annabelle also invites several of their ""Co-workers"" to the team). While Heather appears the more competent cheerleader, Dawn appears to play the role of the ditzy blonde because she always forgets things and spaces out.In the Sentinels' first game using replacement players, they trail by four with only a few seconds left to play. McGinty calls a passing play, but Falco gets scared and changes the call to a running play. Cochran gets tackled just before he reaches the end zone and the Sentinels lose. That night, the actual Sentinels players taunt the replacement players at a bar, leading to fight between the two teams. The replacement players get arrested, but are beginning to build team chemistry, which is something they lacked in the first game.The newfound team chemistry leads to a last second field goal victory in the next game, and then another last second victory the next week, leaving the team needing only one more victory to make the playoffs.However, O'Neil tells McGinty that Eddie Martel has crossed the picket line and will be re-activated by the Sentinels for the final game of the season. McGinty protests at first, saying that he will use Falco as his quarterback, but O'Neil convinces him that the team cannot afford to have Falco choke with the game on the line, especially since they are playing the best team in the league who has had their entire team cross. A heartbroken McGinty tells Falco that he has been cut in favor of Martel, but Falco accepts the news, saying that it's best for the team since Martel is better than him, to which McGinty says that Falco has heart and Martel does not. Falco stands Annabelle up on a date because of his depression.In the final game of the season, Martel has trouble connecting with the team due to his prima-donna attitude, and scolds them whenever he makes a mistake. At halftime, the Sentinels trail 17-0, and reporter asks McGinty what they will need to win the game, to which he replies ""miles and miles of heart"" meant as a message to Falco.Falco hears him say this and comes to the game during halftime, and the rest of the team kicks Martel out of the locker room. Falco runs onto the field at the start of the half and draws loud and thunderous applause from the fans. He apologizes to Annabelle and kisses her on national TV. Cochran is able to run for a touchdown at the beginning of the half before injuring his leg. The Sentinels then score again to cut the lead to 17-14. With only a few seconds left in the game, McGinty calls for a field goal to tie the score and then go into overtime. But when Nigel 'The Leg' Gruff, the kicker, gets set, he tells Falco that he cannot kick the field goal, because several men in the audience will ""take his pub"". Falco then takes the snap then runs it all the way for a touchdown, only to have it brought back for a holding call. Falco then goes to the sidelines and tells McGinty that he wants the ball, implying that he has gotten over his fear of choking with the game on the line. Falco throws a pass to tight end Brian Murphy for a touchdown, and the Sentinels win 20-17, advancing to the playoffs, and the Sentinels begin dancing in synchronized formation.The film ends with a voice-over from McGinty saying that when Falco and the other players left the game that night, there were no endorsement deals or victory parades waiting for them, just a locker waiting to be cleaned out as they all went back to their separate lives... none of them never playing pro-football again when the strike ended. But it didn't matter, because they each got a second chance at fame and glory, which lasts forever."
The Beach,2000,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0163978/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"On vacation in Thailand, Richard sets out for an island rumored to be a solitary beach paradise. Garland's novel centers on a young nicotine-addicted traveler named Richard, an avid pop-culture buff with a particular love for video games and Vietnam War movies. While at a hotel in Bangkok, he finds a map left by his strange, whacked-out neighbor, who just committed suicide. The map supposedly leads to a legendary island paradise where some other wayward souls have settled.—Mike Arndt <clayton@hooked.net> For his first major project after the overwhelming success of Titanic, Leonardo Di Caprio took a risky path in this adaptation of Alex Garland's acclaimed novel, directed by Danny Boyle. Richard (Di Caprio) is an American backpacking through Asia with a handful of friends from Europe. While in Bangkok, he meets a mad Scotsman who calls himself Daffy Duck (Robert Carlyle). Shortly before Mr. Duck kills himself, he gives Richard a crude map to a place in Thailand that he claims is paradise on earth: beautiful, unspoiled, and uninhabited. For lack of anything better to do, Richard and his companions try to locate the spot, which, after a dangerous and taxing journey, takes them to a beach as beautiful as Duck said it would be. Richard and his friends settle in, but before long they discover that they are not alone; a large group of fellow travelers has already dug themselves in, and they have established a community with the same social evils that Richard was hoping to leave behind. Just as important, there is an army of natives who grow marijuana in the nearby hills and do not appreciate the presence of these visitors. Richard (Leonardo DiCaprio), a backpacker, goes to Bangkok, Thailand, with the intention of experiencing something radically different from his familiar life. He meets Françoise (Virginie Ledoyen) and her boyfriend, Étienne (Guillaume Canet) at his hotel. He also meets an eccentric and crazed man, Daffy (Robert Carlyle), who rants on about a beach paradise on a secret island and the parasites of civilization. Daffy later commits suicide but leaves Richard a map to the island, convincing him that it exists.Richard convinces Françoise and Étienne to accompany him to the island, partly out of an infatuation for Françoise and the promise that it's something different from the typical tourist experience. They travel from Bangkok to the shores of Koh Samui in the Gulf of Thailand, where Richard befriends a pair of American surfers. They talk excitedly about the myth of the beach and how it has an almost unlimited supply of marijuana. Richard does not admit his knowledge, but later copies his map and slides it under their door the next morning, wrestling with his decision to inform them but deciding that world travelers aren't supposed to keep information from each other.To finally reach the island, Richard, Françoise, and Étienne must swim across to it. When they first arrive on the island, they come across an enormous marijuana plantation guarded by local farmers armed with AK-47 assault rifles, where they barely manage to evade detection. After jumping off cliff -- Françoise is the first to take the leap ahead of her reluctant male compatriots -- and landing in a lake below, they are seen by Keaty (Paterson Joseph), who takes them to the beach community. They are cautiously interrogated by the island's leader Sal (Tilda Swinton) regarding their knowledge of the island, but are accepted. The trio are introduced to everybody and over the next few days become integrated into the community.One night while Richard and Françoise are walking down the beach, she tells him that she is falling in love with him. They swim out into the ocean to look at a swarm of bioluminescent plankton, where Françoise kisses Richard and has sex with him on the beach. Despite their attempts to keep the romance a secret, the whole island finds out about it, including Étienne. Although devastated, Étienne says he will not stand in their way if Francoise is happier with Richard.At first the island and its community seem to live up to their reputation. Richard swims out into the ocean to catch fish with a harpoon and is attacked by a young mako shark, but he stabs it to death, which gains him much admiration, despite Sal's boyfriend, Bugs (Lars Arentz Hansen) objecting to the fact that it was a young shark with no hunting experience. Events take a turn for the worse when Richard is chosen to accompany Sal to the mainland to acquire supplies. People from the community line up to give Richard needed items to bring back. When Bugs talks to Richard, he viciously squeezes Richard's crotch, slyly warning him not to have sex with Sal.In Koh Phangan, Richard is inadvertently reunited with the American surfers who are preparing to go to the beach with two girls. Richard tries to convince them that the beach turned out to be a myth after all but the surfers aren't so easily dissuaded and storm off when Richard becomes intensely belligerent with them. Sal overhears their conversation about the copy of the map and confronts Richard, who admits his ""guilt"" but doesn't admit he made a copy of the map. In exchange for Sal's silence and Richard's return to the island, Sal blackmails Richard into having sex with her that night.When they return to the island, everything returns to normal until the Swedes are attacked by a shark while fishing. Sten dies almost instantly and Christo is severely injured. The only options for Christo are to go to the mainland to get medical help or stay on the island and take his chances, as Sal refuses to allow a doctor to come to the island. Christo chooses to stay, not wanting to go near the water after his encounter with the shark. Christo's condition worsens, consistently lowering the morale of the whole community, so they take him out into the middle of the jungle and leave him to die. However, Étienne, disgusted by the group's decision, vows to stay with Christo.Later, Sal spots the American surfers on the neighboring island and angrily charges Richard with the task of watching them so he can obtain the map and destroy it. While he's waiting for the surfers to arrive -- they stay on the other island for days, much to Richard's frustration -- Françoise shows up, furious and heartbroken, saying that Sal has told everybody about her tryst with Richard. Richard cannot cope with his task and retreats into the forest, where he becomes temporarily insane, believing that he is communing with the long-dead Daffy. He evades the other islanders and sets lethal traps in an attempt to keep them at bay, at times hallucinating that he is a character in a video game.Meanwhile, the surfers reach the island but are discovered and killed by the marijuana farmers before they can get to the beach. Richard witnesses their executions and retreats to the community to convince Étienne and Françoise to leave the island, believing that all their lives are now in danger. Étienne refuses, not wanting to leave the emaciated Christo, whose leg has become gangrenous. When the other two briefly leave the tent, Richard tearfully smothers Christo to death in a mercy killing. When he leaves the tent, however, he is struck across the face by a farmer and knocked unconscious.He wakes up in a tent in pain, surrounded by the community and the farmers. The farmers approach Sal, with whom they had an agreement, and give her a gun loaded with a single bullet and an ultimatum: shoot Richard dead and be allowed to stay, or leave the island forever. Sal approaches Richard and fires an empty chamber, throwing the crowd into chaos. The lead farmer smiles as the community instantly disintegrates. Sal collapses in a flood of tears, as the crowd, now in hysterics, flees in droves to get away from the island. Together, they swim back to the mainland and go their separate ways.The film ends with Richard stopping by an Internet cafe to check his mail. He receives a letter from Françoise titled ""beach life"" containing a photograph of the whole beach community and an animated handwritten inscription over the image: 'Parallel Universe. Love, Françoise X'."
Little Nicky,2000,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0185431/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"After two of the devil's three sons escape Hell to wreak havoc on Earth, the devil must send his third son, the mild-mannered Nicky, to bring them back before it's too late. When somebody's mother is an angel and his father is the devil, life can be really confusing. For a sweet boy like Little Nicky, it just got a whole lot worse. His two evil brothers Adrian and Cassius have just escaped from Hell and are wreaking havoc on an unsuspecting earth. His dad is disintegrating and it's up to Nicky to save him and all of a humanity by midnight before one of his brothers becomes the new Satan.—Anthony Pereyra {hypersonic91@yahoo.com} Little Nicky is ""daddy's little girl"" in Hell. He's the son of Satan, who got the job from HIS father, Lucifer. Satan wants to retire, but none of his sons are good enough for the job. There's Cassius, who's big and strong, but lacks the 'goodness' to make the job real. There's Adrian, who while really hot (no pun intended) and smart, has no goodness at all. Then there's Nicky [Sandler] who, while having good, lacks any evil whatsoever. As seen in the previews, he is told to release his evil. He needs to release it to save his dad. Cassius and Adrain leave Hell, thereby freezing the wall of fire that lets the damned souls into Hell. Since no souls can come in now, Satan starts to die. It's up to Little Nicky to go and get his brothers, putting them into a flask and bringing them back to Hell at the exact same time to save Satan from decomposition. If Nicky 'dies' on Earth, he will be able to get through the frozen wall and back up to Earth. The catch is that he has only a week, and that Adrian and Cassius are MUCH more powerful than he is.—Liz Skywalker <lizskywalker@hotmail.com> After the lord of darkness decides he will not cede his underworld throne to any of his three sons, the two most powerful of the three escape to Earth to create a kingdom for themselves there. This action closes the portal filtering sinful souls to Hell and causes Satan to begin withering away. He must send his most weak but beloved son, Little Nicky, to Earth to return his brothers to Hell. Can Nicky learn his way around Earth and round up his brothers in time to save Satan?—FMJ_Joker In this very unusual comedy, the devil meets an angel at a certain heaven-hell mixer; both drunk, they have a rendez-vois that produces three kids who somehow end up living in hell with the devil. The movie starts with a picture of hell - a guy falls off a tree spying on a woman taking off her clothes in her own house, ends up in hell. The three kids - Adrian, Cassius, and Nicky - are each very different. Cassius and Adrian live up to their rep of being the devil's children, while Nicky isn't 'into evil,' and is shown as a 'papa's boy.' The movie starts with Cassius and Adrian conspiring to take over Earth by leaving hell and messing up the balance between good and evil, thus taking power over everyone in the process. Their departure 'freezes the fire' through which souls enter hell, however, and the devil begins to fall apart, since no new souls can enter. He sets his only son left, Nicky, on a quest to go to Earth, find his brothers, and trap them in a silver flask, since they have to return to hell at the same time.
Nicky hesitantly takes his father's orders and, with the help of a talking dog his father asked to help, settles into an apartment with a wannabe actor. He's soon found by two devil-worshiping guys who help him retrieve his flask as it's stolen by a petty thief. The guys befriend him and stand by his side against his brothers. Nicky also meets a girl he gets infatuated with, though he doesn't tell her the truth about him yet. She helps get his flask back from the thief, and they... hit it off.
He's able to track down one of his brothers - Cassius - as he possesses the referee at a Globetrotters game. Adrian turns out to be far more witty and doesn't fall for a trap Nicky and all his new friends set up for him at a subway station. Meanwhile, the city of New York becomes unbalanced after the work the two brothers do to destroy it. Adrian summons hundreds of 'followers' who gather to have him lead them on in the end. However, he tells them that at midnight the whole city will turn into hell and they'll all die. Right before that, though, Nicky's brought to heaven when he dies saving his girlfriend's life. He meets his mom, an angel, who tells him the whole story and gives him a bright light in shape of a ball; she says God gave it to her and Nicky would know when to use it. He then emerges at the scene where a crowd gathers for his brother Adrian. He fights him, but Adrian wins and turns into a bat. Nicky then takes out the glowing white ball. It turns into Ozzy Ozbourne, who bites Adrian's head off and spits it into the flask, where the other brother already sits. So, Nicky saves the day, and hell, and his father.
At the end, he gets married to the girl, and their kid is, well, a quarter devil. The devil-worshipers take the money promised them by Adrian for giving out Nicky's location earlier, and by Lynyrd Skyynard's old airplane. They crash it and later take Nicky's place in hell."
Pitch Black,2000,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0134847/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A transport ship crashes and leaves its crew stranded on a desert planet inhabited by bloodthirsty creatures that come out during an eclipse. The space transport vessel ""Hunter-Gratzner"" carrying 40 people on-board crashes on a desert planet when the ship is struck in a meteor storm. There are only 11 survivors, among them are pilot Carolyn Fry (Who has assumed command after the ship's captain is killed), bounty hunter William J. Johns, religious man Abu Al-Walid, Antiques dealer Paris P. Ogilvie, runaway teenager Jack, settlers John 'Zeke' Ezekiel and his lover Sharon 'Shazza' Montgomery, and Richard B. Riddick, a dangerous escaped convict. Marooned, the survivors discover the barren and hot desert-scape has sunlight from three suns. Not only must they find food and water and worry about Riddick, the survivors find themselves being hunted by the planet's flesh-eating inhabitants when the planet is engulfed in darkness, which happens every 22 years, as they emerge from underground to hunt and eat all signs of life. Fry and the survivors find Riddick is their best chance of survival, as Riddick has surgically-enhanced eyes that allow him to see in the dark as they set out to find a way of escaping from the planet and getting to an escape shuttle, before they all get eaten by the creatures on the surface.—Daniel Williamson When the transport ship ""Hunter-Gratzner"" is hit by a meteor shower, the pilot Carolyn Fry is awaken from the cryogenic sleep and tries to control the vessel with forty passengers. She is forced to release a module and only Carolyn; the bounty hunter William J. Johns; the religious Abu ""Imam"" al-Walid; the dealer Paris P. Ogilvie; Sharon 'Shazza' Montgomery; the runaway teenager Jack; John 'Zeke' Ezekiel; Suleiman; Hassan); Ali; and the dangerous criminal Richard B. Riddick survive. Riddick escapes and Johns scares the survivors telling how dangerous he is. The group is stranded in the desert and find that place is heated by three suns and they team-up to seek for water and supplies. Soon they discover that there are under siege of flesh eating aliens that attack in the darkness; further, the planet will be pitch black with a total eclipse. They conclude that it is not with Riddick that they have to be worried about.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Set in the distant future, a spaceship carrying some 40 people, mostly ones wanting to settle on other planets from their own, hits a meteor shower and crash lands on a distant planet killing all but twelve of them. The survivors, led by the second-in-command Carolyn Fry ('Rahda Mitchell' ), find themselves on a hot and arid landscape with constant sunlight from three orbiting suns. Fry not only must help the survivors find food and water, but contend with a deadly criminal, named Riddick (Vin Diesel), who was being transported to a prison cell on their destination. But every 22 years, the planet's three suns go into a total eclipse for a month where darkness brings out the planet's real inhabitants; large, reptilian, vampire-like creatures that come out and dominate the surface in total darkness, killing and eating all life. The Fry and her people then must cooperate with Riddick, who has surgically enhanced eyes to see in darkness, to lead them to safety and off the planet before they all become dinner for the creatures.—Matthew Patay It's in the distant future (when people traveling to outer space is a thing) and in another part of the galaxy away from earth. The space transport ship ""Hunter-Gratzner"" is sailing in its designated lane (marked by stars), carrying about 40 people on board. As is the norm during space travel, all the people are in cryo-sleep (suspended animation); all except one Riddick who exceptionally is awake. Twenty-two weeks into its journey and several weeks away from the next stop, accident strikes, as debris from possibly a rogue comet or a meteor storm hits the ship and pierces the ship's hull. It wakes up the crew, kills the captain, and the ship is knocked into the atmosphere of a nearby planet, thus kicking in gravity. The ship is now descending to the planet's surface at extreme speed and Docking pilot Carolyn Fry (Radha Mitchell) with navigator Greg Owens (Simon Burke) tries to take control. Owen tries to send a distress signal, but the communication antenna is damaged (apparently burning in the friction at the upper atmosphere). Fry tries to control the descent by jettisoning the aft section, which puts the ship into a roll, as it enters the cloud strata of the planet. She deploys air-brakes, and the ship stabilizes from the roll, but still, the rear-heavy ship is descending tail-first, so she begins purging the aft sections sequentially. Owen sees the door behind him close and realizes she intends to jettison the passenger cabin as well and stops her by blocking the airlock. With barely a minute to go, Fry sees the horizon as the ship finally levels. The overloaded air-brakes fail and break the windscreen, and Fry faces the force of air as the ship paces ahead. The ship finally makes a sliding crash landing on the planet, partly guided by the automated program in the ship which has chosen a place to hit that has some oxygen. The impact has broken open the main cabin, scattering objects outside, all along the long trail of impact.There are about 11 survivors of the crash: Carolyn Fry; William J. Johns (Cole Hauser), who appears to be a cop from his badge; a Muslim ""Imam"" Abu al-Walid (Keith David) and three young Muslim boys (Ali, Hassan, Suleiman) he is escorting on hajj (a religious pilgrimage) to the planet New Mecca; antique dealer Paris P. Ogilvie (Lewis Fitz-Gerald); stowaway teenager Jack (Rhiana Griffith) who has run away from his parents; settlers John 'Zeke' Ezekiel (John Moore) and his partner Sharon 'Shazza' Montgomery (Claudia Black); and Richard B. Riddick (Vin Diesel), a dangerous ""criminal"", murderer and feared monster, with unusual eyes- he can see in the dark but is hurt by daylight, so he wears protective goggles in the daytime.As the dust settles, Fry finds Owens is impaled by a metal shaft. She seeks painkillers from the back, but the back of the cabin is gone. With Owens in terrible pain, Fry orders everyone out of the ship, and alone attends to him as he dies. Riddick has partially got free in the chaos but is quickly arrested by Johns. Riddick is blindfolded, chained, and tied inside the ship, while the rest of the survivors come out of the shipwreck and look around.They find that the planet is a barren and bright hot desert-scape. In the distance is a low hill, spiked with many spires (chimney-like structures tapering to the top). The compass needle sways rudderlessly, so there is no sense of direction. They can breathe in its air, though breathing is difficult. As Fry joins them outside, they thank her as ""captain"" for saving their lives from a hopeless situation, but she is unsure having tried to sacrifice them earlier. Some 50 meters away from the main cabin of the wreck-ship, lies the Cargo Hold cabin, where Paris finds his bottles of luxury wine, but they have no water. Imam gives hope- ""All deserts have water. It only waits to be found"".Meanwhile, Riddick sitting tied at hands, legs, eyes, and mouth, escapes using his extraordinary skills bending his shoulders. There is extreme fear about Riddick among the rest of the survivors, due to his notorious past. Johns has them all pick some weapon from the shipwreck (including some antique weapons of Paris), with the message- Riddick would come back to get things of need, so be ready to kill him or be killed by him. Jack is an exception, as he admires Riddick to the point of idolizing him.Outside the shipwreck, Zeke, Sazza, and Jack make a breather aid, to push oxygen intake on need. Johns scans the horizon with his telescope looking for Riddick. It seems to be late afternoon and sunset would happen soon, so Fry asks Imam to get on searching for water while it's cool enough and before nightfall. That's when they see something stunning in the horizon- there are three suns, promising everlasting daylight! A yellowish pair of suns very close to each other are setting, while a blueish sun is rising in the opposite direction. With no nightfall, they should be able to continue searching- for Riddick and water. Imam takes the blue sunrise as the direction from God to search the blue water. Johns is happy that Riddick won't have the advantage of the dark and takes the blue sunrise as the direction to search Riddick (who being comfortable in darkness would have gone opposite of sunset direction). Johns has half the group (Sazza, Paris, Jack, and Zeke with a gun) keep vigil at the wreck-ship, warning them to shoot Riddick at sight, otherwise, there would be a few silent kills, apparently by Riddick's knife skills.The remaining group (Imam, his 3 Muslim boys, Fry, and Johns with his gun) sets off searching, in/towards the blue sunlight (as the other two suns have set). Johns finds ""trees"" in his telescope and that means water. However, on reaching there, they see it's a huge bone structure, lying along a long channel of giant skeletons of animals. They think it's a mass graveyard/boneyard and wonder- is this whole planet dead and who killed them all?The dying Owens had uttered ""Don't touch that handle"" to Fry, apparently referring to the rod piercing his chest, but subconsciously repeating his earlier words to her when she pulled the handle to drop the passenger cabin. Johns, who had picked up this hint, now finds Fry alone near the skeleton's shade and confirms with her that she indeed tried to sacrifice the passengers, with the promise that he won't tell anyone. However they are not alone; hiding behind in the shade is Riddick, with his shiv (knife) made of bone. Through their conversation, Riddick has silently cut away, contrary to the monster image of his, a piece of her hair.Leaving the boneyard, the group continues scouting and walks through a narrow canyon that has many spires at the ridge-tops and a rib cage skeleton making an archway over the path. Near the end of the canyon they begin to find manmade objects like a solar toy robot, and soon reach a complete human settlement, long abandoned. They find water-related items like jugs, moisture-recovery machine, tap, and conclude- there was once water here.Fry finds a dark room that has an orrery, a mechanical model that shows the motion of the planets around their sun(s). She tries a voice command to switch on the lights but gets no response, so she opens the windows to let sunlight in, and the solar-powered orrery starts running. The model shows that there are 3 suns (two yellowish ones close-by and another bluish one away) and three planets between them. One of the end planets has a Saturn-like ring and the middle planet apparently is the one where they have landed. Having suns on either side, the planets should get everlasting sunlight, which explains why the rooms don't have any light bulbs. The model has the option to set the year which arranges the orbits accordingly. As she exits, she finds to her utter delight, a skiff (small spaceship) at the back of the settlement.Back at the wreck-ship, Paris, Sazza, and Jack are near the containers, and Zeke is a watchable distance away near the hill, digging a mass grave, all at the same time nervously watching out for Riddick. They mistakenly shoot an unknown man who looked like Riddick, but he was just a survivor of the crash. Zeke's dug grave is amongst a group of spires and when he brings the bodies there to be buried, he sees a hole in the grave. He inspects the hole and is dragged inside by some unseen force and killed, despite firing his guns. Shazza runs to the place and finds blood everywhere. Also, sitting there is Riddick, knife in hand. As Riddick runs off, Shazza takes him to be Zeke's murderer and they chase him. Johns had heard the gunshot while inspecting the skiff-ship with Fry and had come back. The fleeing Riddick is intercepted by Johns who fights him, tearing off his protective goggles, blinding him with the sun, and he is re-chained in the shipwreck.Fry questions the chained Riddick, who sarcastically confesses, repeating the exaggerated stories about him being whispered around the group who are so fearful of him. When Fry still probes, he replies he is no longer the group's biggest problem, hinting that some unknown creatures killed Zeke and the body may be deeper inside the hole. Fry notices his peculiar shiny eyes and the fanboy Jack asks how he can see at night. Riddick points to his past where he was kept in prison for years away from daylight and a surgical job which led to those changes. Though Johns warns that Riddick is lying (that something else killed Zeke), Fry begins to believe Riddick and decides to investigate the hole. Tethered by a safety wire to the outside, Fry enters deep inside the tunnel where Zeke disappeared and finds his severed ankle and boot. She sees several conical openings to the top through which sunlight beams into the cave- those are apparently the inside of the spires they have seen from outside, and the home of the alien inhabitants of the planet. As she finds the aliens lurking there in the shade and making strange sounds, she freaks out screaming and somehow escapes into another hole, helped by the group outside.Having found bigger problems to handle, Johns unchains Riddick to fight for survival, promising him freedom and under the condition that he won't carry his shiv (knife). The group packs up some belongings and a power cell from the wreck-ship (to test the skiff-ship) and heads to the settlement, a big load on a metal sled being dragged along by Riddick, now part of the group. At the settlement, they try to repair the skiff-ship. Though Paris observes it's very old, Fry thinks if they can adapt its old electrical system to theirs, it will work. Sazza observes it's low capacity (two-seater) and probably cannot go far, but Riddick says even this two-seater can take them to the solar-track shipping lanes from where they can be rescued. Johns stops Riddick from going inside the skiff-ship and diverts him to find materials to repair the wings. Fry manages to power on the skiff-ship for a system check. She calculates they will need five power cells to launch the skiff-ship, as it needs 90 Gig power and each cell is of 20 Gig. They need to fetch four more cells from the wreck-ship, each cell being 35 kg. There is a solar-powered sandcat vehicle at the settlement, which Shazza repairs so as to carry the heavy load.Elsewhere in the settlement, the moisture machine has been repaired and Imam and his boys are overjoyed as water drops from the tap there. Jack has found a shaving tool, shaves his head and dons a pair of goggles in emulation of his idol Riddick. Riddick explores around and finds one Coring Room which strangely is chain-locked from the inside. Jack along with a Muslim boy Ali playfully followed him there, Jack hiding on top of the room and Ali sneaking inside the room. Riddick and Jack come back from there as the group is having a ""party"", apparently celebrating the newfound water. At the gathering, the group discusses the many items left behind at the settlement. They reckon that its former residents were geologists, but wonder why they left the planet and left behind those many items, including the skiff-ship. While Others try to rationalize, Fry doubts and Riddick states baldly that the former occupants are all dead, and by the same creatures who killed Zeke.All this while Ali is still in the nearly dark Coring room, which unfortunately has Alien birds nesting near its ceiling. Riddick had unknowingly uncovered the solar equipment at its roof and slowly an automatic shutter opens, leading sunlight in. As light falls on the nest, hundreds of bat-like Alien birds (apparently young, not fully grown ones) fly around screeching. Ali in panic runs into another dark room inside, as do the birds. Hearing his screams, the others come and break open the Coring room. When they open its inner room, the flock of flying creatures comes out and quickly fly down into the coring shaft, apparently avoiding light in the room. They find and bury the boy's body. They throw a flare light down into the coring shaft to see what's in there and find a huge number of human skulls and skeletons. Riddick explains- the geologists had hid there thinking it to be safe but were killed by the flying aliens through some gaps. Shazza offers Riddick her breather, trying to apologize for thinking he killed Zeke.Fry finds a coring sample dated 22 years ago, of the same month as now. She returns to the planets model and flips through the year setting. They realize that every 22 years there is a total eclipse, as all the 3 planets and the suns on either side align, thus plunging the middle planet into complete darkness. Not only that, the 3 planets then move as one for some time, thus the eclipse should last for a prolonged period of days or months.Fry and others rush on their plan to bring the power cells from the wreck-ship to the skiff-ship, repair the wings and fly out of the planet, all in time before darkness falls (though nobody knows exactly when that will happen). Johns warns against that, telling Fry that Riddick escaped the last time by flying a ship and killing the pilot, so they must not fetch the power cells to the skiff-ship until the last minute, lest Riddick does it again. Fry is rather happy that in Riddick they have another person to pilot a spaceship. Soon Riddick gets Fry alone inside the skiff-ship and contrary to her fear and imagination, rather gives his version of things- his promised freedom, that Johns is not a cop but a bounty hunter, and hints about Johns' drug problem.Fry confronts Johns about the new finding about him and he admits he isn't a cop. She finds Johns shooting morphine into his eyeball and has a stash of morphine and is angry that he didn't give those painkillers when Owen was dying painfully. She wonders what else is Johns hiding and whether he can be trusted to decide the actions for the group. He shows her the wounds he received from Riddick and asserts that how he takes care of himself, drugs or not, is none of her business and she should rather look to herself (hinting at how selfish she was during the crash and she is hiding it and deciding the actions of the group who now think her as the captain).They come out to see that the yellow suns have risen (the blue sun apparently has set), but also, the ring of the other planet appears on the horizon and the massive planet is about to eclipse all sunlight. They hurriedly ride the sandcat vehicle back from the settlement through the canyon back to the wreck-ship and load the power cells on the sled to be dragged. Darkness falls rather quickly, rendering the solar-powered vehicle useless before they could go back to skiff-ship. The rings of the planet cover one sun, then the other sun, and finally the body of the planet covers both suns, thus transitioning from gloomy sunlight to twilight to pitch black. In the twilight, they hear a growing squealing sound from the spires and soon see thousands of mid-sized young aliens flying up into the sky. The men flee to the shelter of the cargo hold cabin (as the main cabin is half open), but Shazza and Riddick fall behind and have to drop to the ground as a torrent of flying creatures passes over. Shazza panics and tries to make a run for it, but is quickly torn into pieces and then carried off in the air. Riddick survives by laying low until the flock flies off. Riddick now removes his goggles and watches in his eyes the distant darkness as the spires break and fully grown alien birds emerge.As they explore inside the cargo hold, which has now become a prison for them, the aliens' sound and wall-piercing blades drive them further and further in. Riddick finds a big alien eating a smaller one in the dark corner of the room, which is when Hassan stumbles in there and both try to stand still, hiding. But when multiple big aliens sit close by and bring out their scythe blades from near their sharp claws, Hassan runs in fear and is killed. Riddick runs off towards the rest of the group who put lights that way and Riddick howls away from the light in his face, and so does the alien behind him. Johns shoots down an alien, and they see that light actually burns their flesh which explains the creatures' light aversion. The creature has vertical curved bone blades on the skull, a mouth with teeth for eating and probably smelling, two long horizontal bone ears, a fleshy body, bird-like claws, scythe-blades that emerge from its sole, wings supporting limited flight, and has no eyes (consistent with the nature of their totally dark environment). It locates an object by sending sound through mouth, receiving the echo through the ears, and imaging the sound.Johns thinks the darkness should be over soon, but Imam reminds: the planets in the model were moving as one during the eclipse, so there would be a lasting darkness. Fry wants to stick to the plan-- move with the cells to the skiff-ship and fly off this planet. Since the aliens fear the light, Fry suggests they use light as cover while moving in the dark. Johns calls that a mass suicide and would rather wait for the suns to rise again, but Fry points out that strategy did not work for the geologists hiding in the coring shaft. Fry and Johns' argument ends in heated and hateful barbs at each other. The rest of the group takes her as captain to be followed, but who can find the correct path in the dark (even though they have seen the path: wreck-ship to open-ground to the boneyard to the canyon to skiff-ship)? Suddenly Riddick is their means of survival- Fry decides Riddick would lead them with his night vision. They move to the main cabin of the wreck-ship, ready the sled with the 4 cells, and bring as much light as possible, including flares, cutting torch, bottles of inflammable spirit, and glow tubes connected to a central machine. Riddick cautions them: avoid bloody cuts as the aliens have an acute sense of smell for the blood. Jack is particularly alarmed at this, the reason for which is revealed later. Finally, they head out in the dark, Riddick leading them with a flashlight at his back and darkness in his front, and... several alien creatures following them and keeping in the shadows away from the light.Paris drops a flashlight and Jack leaves the sled to get it, sparking an alien attack. Jack is saved, but Paris panics and crawls away, breaking the entire glow tube system and quickly his lights go out and he is stabbed by an alien. As he puts to flame his last sip of wine, the terrifying sight of surrounding aliens flashes for a moment. The aliens hungrily feast on him in the dark, watched on by Riddick, who then notices that Jack is a preferred target of those creatures. They continue walking with flares and other lights, but the road seems endless. They find that they have crossed their own tracks, and angrily ask where Riddick is taking them in the dark. Riddick replies he took an extra round as he needed time to think because a death row in the form of the canyon is ahead and because ""the girl"" is bleeding. The group is stunned to discover that ""Jack"" is a girl masquerading as a boy to protect herself and is ""bleeding"". Their earlier passage through the canyon had shown the walls to be full of spires at the top, implying a den of the alien predators, so a bloody girl there with nowhere to escape should be a death row, given the aliens' sense for blood. Fry now realizes the mortal danger they are in now and ahead, with the destination a couple of hundred meters away, and says they should go back to the ship. Johns slaps away her suggestion, recalling her earlier remarks and revealing to the rest her attempts to sacrifice the passenger cabin. The light moves forward- to the skiff-ship.They now move into the boneyard, with Johns and Riddick walking ahead of the rest. To survive the canyon ahead, Johns proposes ""sacrifice one to save many"": let Riddick kill ""Jack"", to be dragged some feet behind the sled, as a bloody bait for the aliens. Riddick is angry at his thought process and fights Johns aiming to kill him. Fry (who had already been suspicious and kept more distance) and others run back in panic, as the fight continues. Riddick cuts John's back with his knife, then merges into darkness as Johns' light on the floor goes out. Johns readies his gun while his bleeding wounds and movement draw aliens, and his gun fails him as he is stabbed by an alien and eaten. Riddick rejoins the group who are running back to the wreck-ship (but without direction thus burning up their light) and refocuses them to walk towards the skiff-ship. When they mourn hearing Johns' death, Riddick slams that, hinting at the kind of thoughts reciprocated for them by Johns.In the boneyard, Riddick finds an alien predator's skeleton, studies its strengths and weaknesses, and realizes the alien has a blind spot at the center, in between its two bone ears. Then Imam joins him and preaches about believing in God, and Riddick hints at his tortured life in the past, which is why he believes in God... and absolutely hates Him.About to enter the canyon, they see it's indeed a death row with a narrow path, and high walls filled with aliens and their sounds all around. As they hesitate, Riddick asks them to see only one way, the way to go off this planet. Riddick takes the power cells, either as a desperate life-saving strategy to enable others to run fast, or as a plan to fly off the planet alone as Johns predicted. Riddick puts on his goggles- either he expects the light in his face as the others should run faster, or he does not want to see the dangers of the dark but only the way out. Finally, all of them run for their lives through the canyon, with Riddick dragging alone the 4 power cells tied together and keeping pace with the others. As they run, a torrent of mid-sized aliens come flying towards them and quickly go over due to the lights. Now they see aliens fighting each other overhead in midair, apparently showing cannibalism from years of hunger. Dead and half-dead aliens and their blue fluid drops down on the ground and they try to run through them. The last Muslim boy gets a bloody leg as one of the fallen aliens grabs his foot. Riddick keeps walking as if he is abandoning them, but ""Jack"" is attacked by an alien and Riddick turns back to fight the alien hand to hand (apparently blocking its scythe blade at the feet), cuts its flesh with his knife, and finally kills it.Suddenly it starts to rain, perhaps indicating the cycle of life in the planet- years of heat followed by night's cool and rains of water. The rain threatens what little light they have left. As they look for cover, the last boy pilgrim is snatched by the aliens. Riddick finds a cave for them to hide in, and sends Fry, ""Jack"" and the Imam inside, but then closes the opening, himself moving on.""Jack"" worries that Riddick is leaving them since he has the power cells and the skiff-ship just after the canyon. Soon all their light goes out in the cave, and they find glowing slugs on the cave walls, and fill their empty bottles with those to make lamps. Fry leaves the cave with a lamp and heads for the skiff-ship. Riddick is there on the pilot seat, preparing to launch, leaving the rest to their fate. He opens the door for her, and she invites him to go back together to bring Imam and ""Jack"" back. Riddick, instead, persuades her to get on the skiff-ship and leave with him, abandoning the rest. She cries, with visions of the passengers on the ship during the crash flashing in her mind. She attacks Riddick and insists they go back for ""Jack"" and the Imam. He holds a knife to her neck and asks if she would die for them, and, to his bemusement, she confidently says yes.Back at the cave, ""Jack"" and Imam find the rock at the opening moving aside and it's a moment of joy and relief for them when they find Fry and Riddick there. All four run to the settlement, but multiple aliens are in the way. They run through them and Riddick sends the rest ahead, himself lagging behind to absorb the attack. The three reach the skiff-ship and Riddick too manages to reach close, but an alien suddenly blocks his way between the buildings. Riddick smartly sways back and forth with it, staying in its blind spot. Unfortunately, as he draws away, a second alien appears behind him and he is ""visible"". The others have hesitated at the skiff-ship, thinking him dead, but then they hear him yell. As Fry rushes towards the sound, Riddick drops down on the ground in front of her, bloody, wounded, gasping, but still clutching his knife. She tries to lift him to his feet, to get to the skiff-ship, but he is too big and heavy. She says ""I said I'd die for them, not you."" He is finally vertical when she is suddenly stabbed from behind by an alien, then pulled away into the air as it flies away with her. He collapses to the ground and lets out in pain- ""Not for me.""Imam and ""Jack"" chat as Riddick takes the pilot seat, turns on the switches, powers up the engines, getting the skiff-ship ready to go. Surprisingly, he shuts the switches back to off, making the others restless for take-off and relief. Quickly, the aliens are drawn to the now-dark area, menacing the skiff-ship from all sides. He now powers up the skiff-ship's engines again and they take off. His ""parting goodnight"" for those inhabitants of the planet is a deadly blow- the bright light and the force of the engines kill the surrounding aliens all around them as they exit the atmosphere. In space, the three survivors; the Imam, ""Jack"" and Riddick, are relieved that their ordeal is over and watch the darkness give way to sunlight. ""Jack"" asks Riddick what they should tell the authorities about him when they are questioned. He tells her- ""Riddick is dead, he died somewhere on the planet"", implying his transformation back to a caring human heart."

Eve's caring for Lou is despite an especially hurtful incident with him seven years earlier.

He recalls his days writing a screenplay with his wife for a John Wayne movie.

The parents notice that the elderly family dog is not well, and express concern about it dying and how sad their daughter would be. It can be replaced by Repet, an animal cloning service, but Adam doesn't trust clones. Cloning knowledge is held by the multinational corporation Replacement Technologies. Human cloning is technically possible, but illegal. Adam thinks his daughter should just learn to accept death as a part of life, rather than being cushioned from it.Arriving at his helicopter piloting business, he and his partner Hank Morgan (Michael Rapaport) learn they are to transport Replacement Technologies CEO Michael Drucker (Tony Goldwyn). Oddly, the CEO's staff requires the pilots to sign several forms, as well as a small blood test and an eye screening, before the flight can be undertaken. Bemused, the pilots submit to the tests. Adam's wife calls with the news that the dog was so ill it had to be put down, and begs him to get a Repet for their daughter. Adam will not commit to it.Drucker has specifically asked for Adam to fly him due to his reputation, but ambitious Hank begs to be the big man this one time. Adam agrees, introduces Hank to Drucker as Adam Gibson, and Hank flies Drucker. Unfortunately, their landing atop a snowy mountain is met by a group of fundamentalists who believe that cloning is immoral and Drucker must die. The party is wiped out.
Adam awakens confused in a taxicab that he does not remember entering. He assumes he fell asleep, and directs the cab to the Repet center so he can find out about cloning the dog. After hearing the sales pitch, he becomes convinced and is about to order the dog when the salesman shocks him by saying he remembered Adam coming into the shop earlier. Adam is disoriented and decides to get the Simdoll for his daughter instead.He returns home and is about to open his front door when he sees through the window - a surprise birthday party, starring a man who looks just like him, with his family and friends.

Adam is forced to ally with his clone to rescue his family.The pair sneak, fight and shoot their way up through the corporate building, passing by the huge tanks where human clones are grown. When he finally confronts Drucker, he gets shocking news. Adam is the clone & the one he saw in the window is the original.

Drucker is fatally wounded in one encounter, and begins preparing a replacement clone. Adam shows up before it is ready, and Drucker is forced to activate it anyway. The half-completed, malformed clone is revealed to be as selfish and self-centered as the original Drucker, but Drucker still gives his all to keep the new Drucker clone alive. Refusing to give up, both die in the end.His wife and daughter are rescued without ever seeing the two Adams together, so they do not have to know what has happened. With the real Adam's permission, the clone Adam goes home and says goodbye to ""his"" wife and daughter, knowing he will never see them again. The real Adam waves goodbye as the Adam clone heads to Argentina, taking one of the company helicopters to start a branch office and a new life."
Thirteen Days,2000,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0146309/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"In October 1962, the Kennedy administration struggles to contain the Cuban Missile Crisis. In October 1962, President John F. Kennedy (Greenwood) learns about the Soviet Union's plan of placing nuclear weapons in Cuba. These weapons could wipe out most of the eastern and southern United States in minutes if they become operational. Kennedy and his advisors must come up with a plan of action against the Soviets. In October, 1962, U-2 surveillance photos reveal that the Soviet Union is in the process of placing nuclear weapons in Cuba. These weapons have the capability of wiping out most of the Eastern and Southern United States in minutes if they become operational. President John F. Kennedy and his advisors must come up with a plan of action against the Soviets. Kennedy is determined to show that he is strong enough to stand up to the threat, and the Pentagon advises U.S. military strikes against Cuba--which could lead the way to another U.S. invasion of the island. However, Kennedy is reluctant to follow through, because a U.S. invasion could cause the Soviets to retaliate in Europe. A nuclear showdown appears to be almost inevitable. Can it be prevented?—<jgp3553@excite.com> The year is 1962. USAF U-2 spy planes discover that the USSR is placing nuclear ballistic missiles in Cuba. The Chiefs of Staff warn President Kennedy and his cabinet that the missiles have the potential to kill up to 80 million Americans, and destroy a large number of USAF bomber bases - thus crippling the Americans' ability to retaliate and leaving the country an easy target for Soviet invasion. Fortunately, the missiles are not yet operational, and the President and his staff try to figure out how to get the missiles out of Cuba - whether by diplomatic means or by force. Initially, diplomatic attempts fail as the Soviets lie and stonewall the President. Secretary of Defence Robert McNamara comes up with a different plan - a naval blockade of Cuba to keep new missiles from reaching the country. When the Russians ignore the blockade and try to run it, things quickly go from bad to worse. Will the Americans & Soviets come to a peaceful settlement - or will nuclear war result?—Derek O'Cain In the early days of October 1962, U.S. spy planes photograph the impending installation of Soviet missile sites in Cuba. While there is widespread agreement that the missiles must not be allowed, there is no clear way to ensure that. The military feels that their destruction followed by the invasion of Cuba is likely the only option. President Kennedy realizes however that to do so, would lead the Soviet Union to invade West Berlin with the result being an all out war. He pushes his subordinates, coordinated by brother Bobby, to come up with an alternative solution. Secretary of Defence Robert McNamara proposes a naval blockade of Cuba which the U.S. initiates with the backing of the Organization of American States. Throughout the 13 day crisis, the President and his inner circle struggle to rein those who would take unilateral action and through back channels, tries to communicate with the Soviet leadership and provide them with a face-saving solution to their mutual dilemma.—garykmcd US and USSR at the height of the cold war, each have enough nuclear weapons to destroy the entire planet many times over.In October 1962, U-2 aerial surveillance photos reveal that the Soviet Union is in the process of placing intermediate-range ballistic missiles (the SS-4 Sandal, 1000 miles range, 3 megaton nuclear warheads) carrying nuclear weapons in Cuba (32 missiles serviced by 3400 men). Cities till Washington DC are in range, and in the event of a launch would have a less than 5 mins warning.
President John F. Kennedy (Bruce Greenwood ) and his advisers (including
Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy (Steven Culp),
Secretary of Defence Robert McNamara (Dylan Baker),
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Maxwell Taylor, USA (Bill Smitrovich),
Special Assistant Kenneth O'Donnell (Kevin Costner),
Deputy Director of the CIA Lieutenant General Marshall Carter, USA (Ed Lauter),
United States Ambassador to the United Nations Adlai Stevenson II (Michael Fairman),
Secretary of State Dean Acheson (Len Cariou),
Chief of Staff of the USAF General Curtis LeMay (Kevin Conway)
Chief of Naval Operations Admiral George Whelan Anderson Jr. (Madison Mason))
must come up with a plan of action to prevent their activation. The missiles will be active in 10-14 days.Kennedy is determined to show that the United States will not allow a missile threat. The Joint Chiefs of Staff advise immediate U.S. military strikes against the missile sites followed by an invasion of Cuba. Kennedy is reluctant to attack and invade because it would very likely cause the Soviets to invade Berlin (which is NATO), which could lead to an all-out war. Citing The Guns of August, Kennedy sees an analogy to the events that started World War I, where the tactics of both sides' commanders had not evolved since the previous war and were obsolete, only this time nuclear weapons are involved. War appears to be almost inevitable. If a strike has to be launched, it has to be before the missiles are operational.
The military minds are pushing hard to play out the WW III scenario. JFK leaves the meeting without giving his decision. Dean is worried that JFK might not be tough enough to make a decision. JFK feels this is moving too fast and it smells like the Bay of Pigs all over again.The Kennedy administration tries to find a solution that will remove the missiles (there are 40 missiles now, IRBMs, which can hit every city in the US except Seattle) but avoid an act of war. Curtis LeMay tries to bully the President into launching a Pre-Emptive strike and thinks that the Soviets will do nothing in response. He is indignant when JFK refuses to authorize the strike as JFK demanded. The military heads believe the Kennedy's to be cowards.
JFK meets Soviet ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin, who continues to maintain that Soviets have only defensive military equipment in Cuba. JFK cannot reveal that US knows about the missiles.JFK rejects a blockade, as this is formally regarded as an act of war, and settle on what they publicly describe as a quarantine. They announce that the U.S. naval forces will stop all ships entering Cuban waters and inspect them to verify they are not carrying weapons destined for Cuba. US military is moved to DEFCON 3 alert status
Adlai suggests making a deal with the Soviets to trade their missiles in Cuba for the NATO missiles in Turkey.
The Soviet Union sends mixed messages in response. Seems like Soviets will run the blockade. JFK orders no shooting at ships without his explicit orders.
The military continues to order spy plane pictures, but one of Kennedy's top advisers, Kenneth O'Donnell (Kevin Costner), calls the pilots to ensure the pilots do not report that they were shot at or fired upon, because if they were, the country would be forced to retaliate under the rules of engagement. Kenneth knows that the military knows that their planes will be shot at and this will force the President into ordering the strikes and the invasion.Off the shores of Cuba, the US ships figure out that the Soviets have deployed subs under their merchant ships. JFK orders the destroyers to force the sub to surface via torpedo strikes. At the last possible moment, the Soviet ships turn back from the quarantine lines. JFK holds on the sub attack order. There are several mini-accidents during the crisis: the defense readiness level of Strategic Air Command (SAC) is raised to DEFCON 2 (one step shy of maximum readiness for imminent war), without informing the President; a nuclear weapon test proceeds (Bluegill Triple Prime) and a routine test launch of a U.S. offensive missile is also carried out without the President's knowledge.Secretary of State Dean Rusk (Henry Strozier) says, ""We're eyeball to eyeball and I think the other fellow just blinked.""Meanwhile Adlai presents his evidence of Soviet missiles in Cuba in the UN Security Council. Adlai makes a mincemeat out of Russian and Cuban ambassadors, who were bullying him up to this point. This was remarkable since nobody in Washington though Adlai had it in him to be tough. Adlai was give the UN job, as it was a parking place till his retirement.
Meanwhile one Soviet ship slips through the blockade undetected. Admiral Whelan orders the ship to be fired upon (he was firing flares to warn them), but gets a severe dressing down from McNamara in front of his staff, not to countermand the President's orders again. McNamara is clear that such actions can easily be misinterpreted by the Soviets and lead to escalation that the President didn't want.John A. Scali (Jack Blessing), a reporter with ABC News, is contacted by Soviet ""emissary"" Aleksandr Fomin (Boris Lee Krutonog) (he is the highest ranking Soviet spy in the US), and through this back-channel communication method the Soviets offer to remove the missiles in exchange for public assurances from the U.S. that it will never invade Cuba. A long message in the same tone as the informal communication from Fomin, apparently written personally by Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev, is received.
This is followed by a second, more hard line cable in which the Soviets offer a deal involving U.S removal of its Jupiter missiles from Turkey. The Kennedy administration interprets the second as a response from the Politburo, and in a risky act, decides to ignore it and respond to the first message, assumed to be from Khrushchev.In the meanwhile the missiles in Cuba are now operational. Soviets have also deployed tactical nukes in Cuba, which means US invasion will have immense costs.
In a bid for time while under intense pressure from the military for an immediate strike, President Kennedy authorizes attacks on the missile sites and an invasion of Cuba, to commence the following Monday. An Air Force U-2 reconnaissance plane is sent over Cuba to gather intelligence for the attack, but is shot down, killing the pilot.
After much deliberation with the Executive Committee of the National Security Council, Kennedy makes a final attempt to avoid a war by sending his brother, Robert F. Kennedy to meet with Soviet ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin (Elya Baskin) on Friday night. Bobby reiterates the demand that the Soviets remove their missiles from Cuba, and in return promises not to invade or assist in the invasion of Cuba.Dobrynin insists that the U.S. must also remove all Jupiter missiles from Turkey, on the border of the Soviet Union. Bobby says that a quid pro Quo is not possible, but in exchange for Khrushchev removing all the missiles from Cuba, there will be a secret understanding that the U.S. will remove all of its ""obsolete"" missiles from Turkey within six months as part of a Pre-scheduled plan. The Soviets announce on Sunday that they will remove their missiles from Cuba, averting a war that could have escalated to the use of nuclear weapons.The film ends with President Kennedy dictating a letter of condolence to the family of the reconnaissance pilot, Rudolf Anderson, who was shot down over Cuba as part of the preparations for the invasion, and the Kennedy brothers and O'Donnell outside of the Oval Office as actual audio of President Kennedy's commencement speech at American University played in the background."

She makes friends with two local women (the religious, but promiscious Sister Husband (Stockard Channing) and Lexi Coop (Ashley Judd), a woman with a pile of kids, who also seems to have considerable man problems until she marries the local exterminator). She also becomes friends with Walmart photographer Moses Whitecotten (Keith David), who leads her to a career, and with a young man, Forney Hull (James Frain), who runs the library and takes care of his alcoholic sister, who is the real librarian.—John Sacksteder <jsackste@bellsouth.net> Novalee Nation (Natalie Portman), seventeen-years-old and very pregnant, has never been part of a real home. The closest thing to family for the hard-luck teen is her selfish, would-be musician boyfriend, Willie Jack Pickens (Dylan Bruno), with whom she's travelling from Tennessee to California in a rust bucket of a Plymouth. A bathroom stop en route, at a Sequoyah, Oklahoma Walmart, changes Novalee's life forever. For when she leaves the store, she discovers that Willie Jack and the Plymouth are gone. Only her Polaroid camera remains in the parking space. Alone and broke, Novalee surreptitiously moves into the vast store, taking food and supplies from its shelves. When she gives birth on the floor - and her hideaway is revealed - Novalee and her ""Walmart baby"" become instant celebrities. More importantly, over the next few years, Novalee finally becomes part of an unconventional, makeshift family comprised of her wonderfully eccentric new friends. Now, with the family she always wanted, Novalee is transformed from a homeless teen to a successful and strong woman. She has finally found a home in this small town where fate has dropped her.—Hyacinth Tachi <hitachi69@hotmail.com> Seventeen-year-old, seven-months-pregnant Novalee Nation (Natalie Portman) sets off on a road trip from Tennessee to California with her ignorant, ne'er-do-well boyfriend, Willy Jack Pickens (Dylan Bruno). In Sequoyah, Oklahoma, Novalee asks Willy to stop at a Wal-Mart so that she can use the bathroom and replace her shoes, which had fallen out the bottom of their beat-up car. When Novalee reaches out for her change at the checkout, the sum of $5.55 sends her into a panic, as she believes that the number 5 is a bad omen, as when she was 5, her mother left her for a baseball umpire; and when she was waitressing, a customer went berzerk and cut her arm from wrist to elbow, and it took 55 stitches to close the wound. She runs outside to discover that Willy has taken off without her.For the rest of the afternoon, Novalee browses Wal-Mart, where she meets Sister Husband (Stockard Channing), who runs the Welcome Wagon in town. Sister Husband mistakenly believes Novalee to be her long-lost relative Ruth Ann, and she gives her a buckeye tree and a welcome basket. Novalee also meets photographer Moses Whitecotton (Keith David) who later becomes her mentor. That evening, Novalee feels unwell and runs into the bathroom to vomit. When she comes out again, she discovers that the store is closed, locked, and dark. She soon figures out how to live undetected in the Wal-Mart.Novalee visits the town library and meets Forney Hull (James Frain), who works there while caring for his sister ""the librarian"", an alcoholic. Novalee learns from Sister Husband that Forney was attending Bowdoin College in Maine, where he was studying to be a history teacher before he had to leave school to care for his sister. Novalee goes to Sister Husband's house and explains that she is not Ruth Ann. Nonetheless, Sister Husband invites her in for cornbread and buttermilk, and Novalee plants the buckeye tree in Sister's yard.Back in the Wal-Mart, Novalee wakes up during a thunderstorm when she starts feeling pain in her abdomen. Her water breaks, and while attempting to mop it up, she goes into labor. As she collapses, she notices that she is in Aisle 5, so she makes a big effort to move to the next aisle. At this moment, Forney (who saw her go into the store at closing time) jumps through a plate-glass window and helps deliver her baby.The next morning, Novalee wakes up in the hospital, where she learns she has become a minor celebrity for giving birth in a Wal-Mart. After being asked by her nurse, Lexie Coop (Ashley Judd) what she will name her baby, Novalee replies Americus, following Moses's advice to name her a strong name. Novalee gets to know Lexie, who reveals that she has had four children by three different men, all named after snacks: Brownie, Praline, Cherry, and Baby Ruth. While in the hospital, Novalee gets a visit from her mother (Sally Field), whom she has not seen since she was a child. Her mother asks if she has a place to live. Novalee says no, and her mother says that pooling their cash, they can get an apartment together. She hands over all her money, $500, to her mother, who promises to pick her and Americus up at 9:00 a.m. the next day. At 12:15 p.m. Novalee is still waiting, and realizes that her mother took her money, leaving her destitute and homeless. Just then, Sister Husband comes by and invites Novalee and the baby to live at her house, as ""she does not know how to take care of the buckeye tree"".Meanwhile Willy Jack is in prison but trying to make it as a country singer, after being arrested for dating a young teenager who robbed a 7-11, and hired by music agent Ruth Meyers (Joan Cusack).Back at Sister Husband's house, an evangelical couple from Midnight, Mississippi come to ""show the Wal-Mart Baby the word of God"", but Sister Husband slams the door on them. Novalee and Forney are getting Christmas trees when Forney recalls that Americus is five months old, sending Novalee into a panic about her unlucky number and racing home to find out that Americus has been kidnapped. Sister Husband tells a police officer about the church folks that came to her house from Midnight, Mississippi. Novalee recalls that while in the hospital, she was reading cards that people sent her, and that one from Midnight, Mississippi said her baby was an abomination to the Lord. They follow the police cars to the outside of a church, where they find Americus in Baby Jesus's manger.Five years later, Novalee has begun a career as a photographer with the help of Moses Whitecotton. One day a tornado blows through the town. Novalee and Americus hide in an underground shelter, but Sister is out running an errand and does not make it back in time. Sister Husband is killed and their home is destroyed. After the funeral, one of Sister Husband's friends informs Novalee that she is the beneficiary of Sister's estate, worth around $41,000, which Novalee uses to build a new home for herself and Americus on Sister's land.One day, Novalee receives a call from Brownie, Lexie's eldest child. Novalee cannot hear what he is saying, but eventually perceives that something bad has happened. She goes over to Lexie's house, where she finds Lexie, Brownie, and Praline covered in blood and bruised. Novalee invites Lexie and her now five children to live with her and Americus in their new house. Lexie tells Novalee that her new boyfriend had tried to molest her two oldest children, Brownie and Praline, when Praline threw up on him, whereupon Lexie returned home from work early and caught him before he got to Brownie. Lexie attacked him, hitting him twice before he knocked her out. Lexie is at first devastated, but as time passes she and her children begin to heal, and she eventually marries the ordinary yet reliable Ernie the Exterminator and has another child.When Forney's sister passes away due to alcoholism and he does not show up at the funeral, Novalee finds him in a hotel and comforts him. They end up sleeping together, after which he tells her that he loves her; she doesn't reply. Forney returns to Maine to bury his sister, and the townspeople remark on how he can finally leave town and have a life. When he comes back, he talks about visiting Bowdoin, and Novalee realizes that he can now finish his education. Forney tells Novalee he loves her and wants to stay with her, but Novalee lies, saying she does not love him, and he leaves.On Americus's 5th birthday, Novalee is paranoid about her party because of unlucky five: When Americus was five days old, she had jaundice; at five weeks old, she had an ear infection; at five months old, she was kidnapped).Meanwhile, Novalee picks up a newspaper and reads about a double amputee being robbed of his wheelchair. The amputee proves to be Willy Jack, who lost his legs when he got drunk after being sued for copyright infringement for his hit song. While drunk, he kept hearing Novalee's voice talking about Americus; then he tripped on train tracks and was hit by an oncoming train. During his singing career, he just missed running into Novalee when he entered an elevator with his agent just moments after Novalee exited the other elevator on her way to accepting an award for a photograph.Novalee visits Willy in the hospital and tells him about her life. He admits that he lied to her when he told her that he didn't feel the baby's heart beat the day he left her. He says he wishes he could go back and undo the lie, because a single lie can change your whole life. He explains that people lie because they're ""scared, crazy, or just mean"". Novalee realizes that she made a similar mistake lying to Forney. She drives Willy Jack home to Tennessee and then continues on to Maine to find Forney. Novalee admits to him that she lied and that she really loves him, and they return to Oklahoma to get married in a Wal-Mart."
Pay It Forward,2000,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0223897/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A young boy attempts to make the world a better place after his teacher gives him that chance. Young Trevor McKinney, troubled by his mother's alcoholism and fears of his abusive but absent father, is caught up by an intriguing assignment from his new social studies teacher, Mr. Simonet. The assignment: think of something to change the world and put it into action. Trevor conjures the notion of paying a favor not back, but forward--repaying good deeds not with payback, but with new good deeds done to three new people. Trevor's efforts to make good on his idea bring a revolution not only in the lives of himself, his mother and his physically and emotionally scarred teacher, but in those of an ever-widening circle of people completely unknown to him.—Jim Beaver <jumblejim@prodigy.net> A school social studies assignment leads to social changes that spread from city-to-city. Assigned to come up with some idea that will improve mankind, a young boy decides that if he can do three good deeds for someone and they in turn can ""pay it forward"" and so forth, positive changes can occur. What appears to initially be a failure, is indeed a success that is not immediately known but is traced backwards by a reporter who is a benefactor. The initial recipients of the boy are a drug addict, his badly scarred school teacher, and a classmate who is constantly bullied by his peers. While physically and mentally scarred by past events, the teacher is not the only one bearing scars. The young boy fears his mother's fate, particularly at his brutal, alcoholic father's hands. The mother also bears scars from her childhood with a homeless, alcoholic mother.—John Sacksteder <jsackste@bellsouth.net> A 12-year-old schoolboy in Las Vegas, Nevada named Trevor McKinney (Haley Joel Osment) is given a class project to complete by his social studies teacher Eugene Simonet (Kevin Spacey), a man with terrible burn scars on his face and neck. His task is to come up with a plan that will change the world through direct action. On his way home from school later that day, Trevor notices a homeless man, Jerry (James Caviezel) and decides to make a difference in Jerry's life. Trevor then comes up with the plan to ""pay it forward"" by doing a good deed for three people who must in turn each do good deeds for three other people, creating a charitable pyramid scheme. Trevor's plan is to help Jerry by feeding and housing him so he can ""get on his feet.""The next morning, Trevor's mother, Arlene McKinney (Helen Hunt), a single mother recovering from alcoholism, becomes angry with Trevor after finding Jerry in their house. She then accuses and confronts Eugene at the school about the reason Trevor has allowed Jerry into their home. Eugene is also intrigued by Trevor's response to the social studies project.Later that night back at their home, Trevor confronts his mother about her alcoholism, and in a fit of anger she slaps him across the face. Trevor runs away from home, and Arlene asks Eugene to help her find him. They find Trevor at a bus station, about to be molested. Trevor and Arlene embrace in relief after Arlene apologizes profusely.Meanwhile, Chris (Jay Mohr), a journalist, is trying to find out why a total stranger gave him a brand new Jaguar S-Type car after Chris' old 1965 Ford Mustang was damaged in a car accident. The stranger's only explanation is that he is simply ""paying it forward"". When Chris asks him for more information, the man explains that, when he recently visited a hospital while his daughter was suffering an asthma attack, a gang member suffering from a stab wound actually took up a gun to force the doctors to look at the man's daughter before she collapsed, prompting Chris to begin his search again.After Trevor's apparently unsuccessful attempt to help Jerry, he decides to help Eugene by setting him up with Arlene, Trevor's own mother. Their relationship grows in strength until Arlene's ex-husband, Ricky (Jon Bon Jovi), who claims he has ""changed"" and has quit drinking, shows up unannounced and Arlene decides to give him another chance.When Arlene later tries to explain her choice to Eugene, the audience learns how Eugene's burns were the result of terrible child abuse by his father. Eugene is concerned not just about the abusive and violent nature of Trevor's father, but that the simple absence of a loving father is detrimental to Trevor's well-being. He explains that his father was always abusive of him and his mother always took him back. At thirteen, Eugene ran away from home and returned home when he was 16, asking his mother to come with him but his father knocked him out and proceeded to burn him, resulting in a number of scars on his chest. Arlene feels that she must nevertheless give her ex-husband another chance, but shortly thereafter he becomes angry and violent and it appears that he has not in fact stopped drinking alcohol. Arlene realizes what a terrible mistake she has made. She feels that Eugene will never take her back, and Eugene for his part is not prepared to rekindle the relationship.At around this point, Jerry, who has moved on to another city, discovers a woman about to commit suicide by jumping off a bridge; even when she throws her purse at him and yells at him to get away, Jerry simply talks gently to her, encouraging her to come down and talk to him about her problems. Meanwhile, Chris discovers the gang member who helped the man's daughter, who reveals that he was brought into the 'pay it forward' movement when he was rescued from the police by a homeless woman in a car. Having located the woman (played by Angie Dickinson), she tells Chris that she herself was given the idea by her daughter--who turns out to be Arlene.Arlene seeks out her mother, Grace, whom she has not seen in three years. She says she wishes to say something to her and gives her mother the gift that enables Grace to have faith that she can become sober for a few days, long enough to visit the family and see her grandson: Arlene tells her mother that she forgives her for everything.Chris finally identifies Trevor as the originator of ""pay it forward,"" and conducts a recorded interview at the school. Trevor explains his hopes for the concept, but voices his concerns that people may be too afraid to change their own lives in order to make the whole world a better place. Eugene and Arlene are both present during the interview. When Eugene hears Trevor's words, he realizes that he and Arlene should be together.As Eugene and Arlene reconcile with a passionate embrace, they hear shouts and scuffling outside. Trevor has come to the defense of a friend who is being attacked by bullies, and is trying to fight them off, although they are older and bigger. As Eugene and Arlene run down to stop the fight, the main bully who is a gangster-like boy impulsively pulls out a knife. Trevor is pushed onto the boy with the knife and is thus inadvertently stabbed in the abdomen. Trevor is rushed to hospital, where he dies from the stabbing.Terribly distraught, Arlene and Eugene are later watching a television news report about ""pay it forward"" and Trevor's death, and learn that the movement has grown nationwide. Venturing outside, they see hundreds of people gathering in a vigil to pay their respects to Trevor, with yet more people arriving in a stream of vehicles visible in the distance as the movie ends.(Source: WikiPedia.

Dracula 2000,2000,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0219653/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A group of thieves breaks into a chamber expecting to find paintings, but instead they release the count himself, who travels to New Orleans to find his nemesis' daughter, Mary Van Helsing. In the millenium version of this classic Gothic horror we find Abraham Van Helsing (Plummer), who has tangled with Count Dracula (Butler) in the past, working as an English antiques dealer. Simon (Miller) is a vampire hunter in training under his apprenticeship. Van Helsing and Simon travel from London to New Orleans to rescue Van Helsing's daughter Mary (Waddell) from the family's life long nemesis - Dracula.—Sujit R. Varma 1897 England: The schooner Demeter is nearing England. The crew is dead,
and the captain is lashed to the wheel. Dracula has arrived.2000 London: Matthew Van Helsing [Christopher Plummer], an aging collector of antiques, and his
protegee Simon Sheppard [Jonny Lee Miller] are discussing the purchase of a medieval crossbow
that Matthew means to add to his personal collection in the Carfax Museum.
Among the artifacts on public display, Carfax Museum also houses a
heavily-protected vault, and no one knows what it contains. It must be
pretty valuable, though, so another employee, Solina [Jennifer Esposito], has arranged to
break into the vault and steal whatever is in there.
While Matthew sits in his office at the end of the day, Solina and
her companions (Marcus, Trick, Nightshade, Dax, Charlie, and J.T) break
the computer codes and make their way to the main vault, passing numerous
vampire skulls and crosses along the way, only to find...a coffin. No one
would think to look for treasure in a coffin, they reason, so this must be
it. In searching for a way to open it,Eddie and Dax are impaled by spikes causing an alarm to go off in in Matthew's office. ""It's not possible!"" Matthew whispers to himself, arms himself with a gun that
shoots silver bullets, and goes down to the vault to find that the coffin
is gone, the thieves having removed it through a hole they've blasted in
the vault's wall. ""God help us all!"" Matthew exclaims.
When Simon comes into work the next day, he finds Matthew preparing
to travel. But Matthew won't reveal where he is going, so Simon follows
him...all the way to New Orleans.New Orleans: Mary Heller [Justine Waddell] is awakened by a dream in which a vampire is
attacking her. Mary has been having this dream for all her life and finds
them troubling enough that she is receiving counseling from her family
friend, Father David [Nathan Fillion]. She thinks the dreams have to do with something that
happened to her mother before she died, and she thinks Fr David might know
what it is. But Fr David isn't talking. On the other hand, Mary's
roommate, Lucy Westerman [Colleen Fitzpatrick] thinks that all Mary needs is a real man in her
bed. But it's Mardi Gras, and Mary vows not to let it bother her.Meanwhile, the thieves are transporting the coffin on a cargo plane.
Still trying to open it, Nightshade cuts himself. His blood is sucked into
the coffin and the lid opens to reveal a body, a bunch of leeches, and a
crucifix set with a ruby. As Nightshade searches the coffin for more treasure,
Dracula [Gerard Butler] awakens. One by one, the thieves are drained of their blood, and
the plane ultimately crashes in a swamp near New Orleans, the pilot lashed
to his seat. While newscaster Valerie Sharpe [Jeri Ryan] is covering the crash,
Dracula emerges from the swamp and makes her his second vampiress (Solina
being first).Matthew and Simon go to the townhall where the bodies from the plane
crash have been taken. By now, they're all vampires. Matthew and Simon
manage to destroy some of them, but Solina and Marcus escape. As Matthew
and Simon drive away, Matthew finally fills Simon in on what's happening.
Stoker's Dracula is real, he says, and Matthew Van Helsing is really
Abraham Van Helsing, kept alive by injections of Dracula's blood, which he
has been filtering through leeches. Van Helsing has been keeping Dracula's
body ever since he bested him in 1897. Unlike other vampires, who can be
destroyed by piercing their hearts or cutting off their heads, Dracula
cannot die, and Van Helsing intends to remain alive until such time as he
can learn the secret to Dracula's origin and find the way to end him. So
far, all he has managed to learn is that Dracula hates God and is repulsed
by all things Christian. He also reveals that he (Van Helsing) has
fathered a daughter, Mary Heller, and that Dracula has come to New Orleans
to find her. The two decide to go looking for Mary, Van Helsing to her
house and Simon to the Virgin Megastore where she and Lucy both work.Dracula is apparently following the same plan. He comes to Virgin
looking for Mary, but Lucy tells him that she isn't there. Lucy takes
Dracula home to wait for Mary. Dracula seduces Lucy and turns her into
vampiress #3. When Simon arrives at Virgin, Mary has returned. Simon tries
to tell her about her father. As they leave the shop, Simon is attacked by
Marcus. ""Never ever fuck with an antiques dealer,"" Simon warns Marcus just
before beheading him. Meanwhile, Van Helsing arrives at Mary's house, only
to find Dracula waiting for him. ""You can't have her!"" Van Helsing
exclaims, but Dracula refuses to listen. ""You stole life from my blood and
passed it to another,"" he hisses. ""She's MY Mary now."" With that, Dracula
kills Van Helsing by tossing him into a mirror.Mary goes home to find her father dead and the three vampiresses and
Dracula awaiting her. She escapes into Simon's arms. Looking for a sacred
place to spend the night, they go to a church. While in the parish
library, they research Dracula's background, learning only what they
already know about his despise of all things Christian--holy water, the
cross, the Bible. Only his dislike of silver remains unexplained.
Suddenly, Dracula appears. Mary flees into the church cemetery while Simon
attempts to divert Dracula with an open Bible. Dracula *is*
diverted...right into the cemetery where he explains to Mary, ""I have
walked the earth for centuries in search of a soul not bitten but born.
Everything I am is yours, and all that you are is mine.""Dracula takes Mary to the church roof where he reveals to her the
secret of his long existence. He is Judas Iscariot, the disciple who sold
out Christ to the Romans for 30 pieces of silver (hence, Dracula's dislike
of silver). In atonement, Judas hung himself, but the rope broke and God
scourged him with eternal life as a vampire. In a soliloquy in front of a
lighted crucifix, Dracula cries out to God, ""Now I drink the blood of
*your* children. You made the world in your image. Now I make it in mine.""Meanwhile, Simon sees the three vampiresses feasting on Mardi Gras
revelers. He stakes Valerie, but the remaining two capture him. Dracula
takes Mary to Simon and tells her to feed from him. ""I'd like his head,""
Mary says while unsheathing a sword. Just as she prepares to swing the
sword, Lucy cries out, ""She's faking!"" In the melee that follows, Mary
beheads Lucy instead of Simon, Simon beheads Solina, and Dracula winds up
hanging by his neck from the lighted crucifix...just as the sun comes up.
Dracula bursts into flames. Mary vows to take over her father's job of keeping Dracula's ashes, lest Dracula find a way to return to life.

He finds an excuse to return to the restaurant in hopes of seeing the waitress again, there's just something attractive about her. Unknown to both the attraction they both feel for one another is Grace has the heart of Bob's dead wife. What can you say after that! Carroll O'Connor says exactly the right thing to Bob after he finds out this ironic coincidence.—Gremma In Chicago, architect Bob Rueland is mourning the death of his wife, zoologist Dr. Elizabeth Rueland, who has long researched gorillas at the Lincoln Park Zoo and who was his one and only since they met when they were fifteen, from a tragic car accident, while Grace Briggs, who has suffered from heart problems since age fourteen, and her support network comprised primarily of her Irish-Italian extended family, rejoice the fact of she finally receiving a heart transplant, she receiving Elizabeth's heart. Grace would have succumbed shortly to her heart problems without the transplant. One year later, Bob is still not ready to date, despite the efforts of who is and was his and Elizabeth's best friend, veterinarian Dr. Charlie Johnson, in setting him up. A now healthy Grace, who up until now has been unable to have sex, is grateful for her new lease on life, but has not dated in being self-conscious about her surgical scar. After a few near encounters, Bob and Grace meet, not knowing about their connection through Elizabeth's heart, and are immediately attracted to each other. They begin to date, and in Grace putting off telling him about her heart transplant in not wanting to scare him off by the scar, they fall in love.

Both Bob and Grace struggle to maintain normal lives after these traumatic events, until fate intervenes and brings them together.—Stephen Hughes In this comedy-drama which shows us how the tragic death of one human being can still save the life of another, a happily-married man (David Duchovny) is struck with tragedy when his wife (Joely Richardson) dies from complications of a car accident.

Finally able to live a normal, happy life for the first time in years, she joins her grandfather in helping to run an Irish-themed restaurant, where she meets the widower, never imagining that the heart beating in her chest belonged to his wife. They slowly fall madly in love with each other, but when she learns the shocking truth, she is torn by whether or not she should let him know about the transplant she received and who it came from.—Curly Q. Link Bob Rueland (David Duchovny) and his wife Elizabeth (Joely Richardson) are deeply in love. She is a dedicated animal psychologist specializing in great apes, who has for 16 years worked with a gorilla at the Chicago zoo. Bob is a builder, and he is very committed to a project to build a wonderful new gorilla exclosure at the zoo, to his wife's design.Grace Briggs (Minnie Driver) is an orphan who has been brought up by her devoted grandfather Marty O'Reilly (Carroll O'Connor) who is proprietor of an Italian restaurant, the chef being Marty's dear friend Angelo Pardipillo (Robert Loggia). Grace's great friend is Megan Dayton (Bonnie Hunt), married to the chauvisnistic but clumsily chivalrous Joe (James Belushi). Grace has a weak heart, caused by incurable disease, and needs a transplant.One night, after a gala with guest in evening dress, Elizabeth is fatally injured and dies in the hospital. She's a donor and her heart is transplanted into Grace. Bob is devastated and so is Elizabeth's dog Mel, which pines for her in their apartment hallway for months. During this time Grace gradually recovers from surgery with her new heart, and after much thought writes a letter to the donor family of her heart, for forwarding by the donor/transplant agency as the arrangement is anonymous. Grace creates a garden full of varied flowers, in Marty's back hard in the city; and she paints pictures, of the city scene around her but also of scenes of an Italian city, though she has never been abroad. She gets around the city on her bicycle, and often visits Megan. They go with Megan's children to the zoo, and --- mysteriously, because he doesn't do it for anybody else --- the gorilla comes over and gives Grace a ""high-five"" with his hand on the divider through which visitors look at him. Grace even passes close to Bob in the crowd around the existing gorilla enclosure, and he seems to experience some frisson as though he can feel Elizabeth's heart still beating but now inside Grace.At last, after a year or so, one of Bob's best friends Charlie Johnson (David Alan Grier) persuades him to come out on a foursome date. Charlie is a veterinary expert at the zoo, involved with the care of the gorilla. On top of all his other projects (on which he is always the man in charge of the whole operation), Bob has been working intensively on the new gorilla enclosure and has been seeing a lot of Charlie, who also knew Elizabeth very well but has grown increasingly concerned about Bob's state of mind since her death. The place they pick for the four-way date, about which Bob is still doubtful, is O'Reilly's Italian restaurant. Bob turns up late and is dismayed by the fussy, bossy personality of the woman who is his blind date; however he is rather taken with Grace, who comes to take their order. He even asks her whether they have met somewhere. Bob finally contrives a mobile phone call and claims he must rush back to work on one of his projects which has hit a crisis needing him on site immediately although it's late. Grace gives him a dinner to take away, and he escapes to eat it on his own. He leaves his mobile phone on the counter and only realizes the next day that he has mislaid it. He goes back the next night after hours, and is greeted by Mary, Angelo and their two elderly friends, one of whom is the apple in the eye of O'Reilly's other waitress, the amply proportioned Sophie (Marianne Muellerleile). These four repeatedly debate the relative merits of Sammy Davis, Dean Martin, Bing Crosby and Frank Sinatra, and play cards.Grace has gone to bed and is unaware that Bob has arrived in the now closed restaurant. She goes downstairs in her dressing gown and shower cap, and is horrified to find Bob there seeing her en deshabille. However Bob is undisturbed and, as he helps her cover the flowers in her precious garden against an expected gale, asks her out the next evening.The couple are in love but Grace gets increasingly obsessed with the idea that he must not find out she has had heart surgery. Then, on first being invited back to his apartment, she discovers her own letter ""to the donor family"" on his deak, and realizes this is the man whose dead wife's heart is now inside her. She goes to pieces, takes the letter, and leaves. Bob goes to see her and she shows him the letter. This time, it is Bob who leaves abruptly.All this time, Grace has had an airline ticket to Italy which Marty got for her. The next time Bob calls, she says she is going away, to Italy, to paint. Bob presents her with a new bright red bicycle, and she takes it to Italy with her. But, sitting in her room or with her easel on a rooftop with her artist's easel in front of her, she thionks only of Bob and can't get anything done. An avuncular Italian waiter comes and offers her refreshment. WHen she declines he offers to listen to her story.Meanwhile Bob is distracted, can't concentrate on his work, and the next thing we see he is on an Italian street. That morning, Grace encounters a trio of nuns who admire her beautiful red bicycle. She offers one a ride on it. Off the nun pedals into the crowd. The scene shifts to Bob, a little way off in the same town, who finds himself looking at random at cyclists as they speed past him. Then a nun comes by, and he thinks he recognizes the bike so he runs after her. We go back to Grace and the other two nuns; when the third returns on the bike, she is riding on the fron and a man is behind her pedalling. It is Bob.

Americans Alice and Peter Bowman have traveled from third world country to third world country working on humanitarian projects. They are currently in Tecala, a country nestled in the Andes, as Peter, an engineer, has been hired by QUAD Carbon, an oil company - the moral ""enemy"" - to lead a project to construct a dam to prevent what is the constant flooding in the country. Alice and Peter eventually learn that QUAD Carbon cares nothing about the dam, which is just a smoke-screen to get an oil pipeline approved and built.

On his way to work one day, Peter, along with a group of others, are random kidnap victims of left wing guerrillas, the Liberation Army of Tecala (ELT), whose reason for being has changed from a political agenda to a monetary one, primarily getting said money through kidnapping and the drug trade in cocaine. The ELT may believe they can get good money for Peter being an oil company executive, despite he not being wealthy as he is not on the oil side of the business. Luthan Risk International, who is the contracted agency for QUAD Carbon's kidnap and ransom (K&R) requirements, dispatches Australian-British Terry Thorne to negotiate Peter's release, Terry an ex-special ops soldier who is known as the best in the business within his own circles.

Almost Famous,2000,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0181875/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A high-school boy in the early 1970s is given the chance to write a story for Rolling Stone magazine about an up-and-coming rock band as he accompanies them on their concert tour. The early 1970s. William Miller is 15-years old and an aspiring rock journalist. He gets a job writing for Rolling Stone magazine. His first assignment: tour with the band Stillwater and write about the experience. Miller will get to see what goes on behind the scenes in a famous band, including the moments when things fall apart, and for him, it will be a period of new experiences and finding himself.—grantss Set in 1973, it chronicles the funny and often poignant coming of age of 15-year-old William, an unabashed music fan who is inspired by the seminal bands of the time. When his love of music lands him an assignment from Rolling Stone magazine to interview the up-and-coming band Stillwater -- fronted by lead guitar Russell Hammond and lead singer Jeff Bebe William embarks on an eye-opening journey with the band's tour, despite the objections of his protective mother.—Jwelch5742 William Miller is a 15-year-old kid hired by Rolling Stone magazine to tour with and write about Stillwater, an up-and-coming rock band. This wonderfully witty coming-of-age film follows William as he falls face-first to confront life, love, and lingo.—Filmtwob <webmaster@filmfreak.co.za> The story opens with William Miller (Michael Angarano), living at home with his mother Elaine (Frances McDormand) and his sister Anita (Zooey Deschanel) in San Diego, California. While William gets along well with his mother and sister separately, both of the women in his life are at odds with each other. Elaine struggles to keep some form of control over Anita, who feels that her mother is too overbearing and controlling.During this time, it is revealed to William that his Mom skipped him ahead 2 grades, as all his classmates around him are 13, and he's 11. William's life also is thrown for a loop when his sister Anita decides to leave home to become a stewardess, in order to escape from her Mom. After she leaves, William finds that Anita has left him her record collection.Her collection ends up having a major impact on William. By the time he turns 15, William (Patrick Fugit) has become interested in rock music and journalism, writing for several underground newspapers, and Creem Magazine, edited by one of his idols, famed rock writer Lester Bangs (Philip Seymour Hoffman). One day, William encounters Lester in San Diego, and the two discuss rock music and journalism. Even though Lester claims the industry is destroying the genre and rock journalism is not a stable thing, he sees a determination in William to succeed, and requests he interview Black Sabbath, who are set to play at the San Diego Sports Arena.William attempts to get in, but is rebuked by the doorman at the arena. Unsure what to do, he meets a group of girls who call themselves Band-Aides. William is introduced to their leader, Penny Lane (Kate Hudson), who explains their philosophy, of how they are not groupies but are there to support the music.Shortly thereafter, William manages to get into the arena when he meets the opening act for the night: the band Stillwater. Complimenting them on their sound and musical talent, they invite William to join them backstage. During this time, William ends up interviewing them, with the bulk of the interview coming from member Jeff Bebe (Jason Lee). William ends up watching the concert from side-stage, as the band opens for Black Sabbath, performing the song ""Fever Dog.""After the show, Lead guitarist Russell Hammond (Billy Crudup) invites William to meet them at the Continental Hyatt House in Los Angeles, and tells William that they'd like Penny Lane to come along. William informs Penny and as they exit the sports arena, she gives him her contact information, and tells him of her life's goal: she plans to live in Morocco for one year.A few days later (unknown to his mother), William sneaks off to Los Angeles with Penny, where they meet up with the band at the Hyatt House (nicknamed 'The Riot House'). It is here that William sees there may be some chemistry going on between Russell and Penny. He also is introduced to Polexia Aphrodesia (Anna Paquin), and Vic Munoz (Jay Baruchel).A few days later, William gets a call from Ben Fong-Torres (Terry Chen) of Rolling Stone magazine. William disguises the fact that he's 15 years old, and pitches his voice lower. Fong-Torres compliments him on his work, and asks William about any bands he'd like to cover. William suggests Stillwater, and soon joins the band on the road, traveling with the Band-Aides on the band's bus (named Doris), much to the horror of his mother, who fears that this will interfere with his school work & derail Williams' future.Along the way, a number of incidents happen to which William is privy:At an outdoor stage event, Russell is electrocuted, sending the band scrambling from the venue, much to the anger of the show's promoter. The band trashes the trailer provided by the promoter, who seems unconcerned about Russell's injury. When the promoter has the arena gates locked, the band has their driver crash the bus through them to escape.-Jeff Bebe gets into a heated row with Russell when the band's first t-shirts arrive, and Russell is the only recognizable person in the band while everyone else is out of focus. The argument is indicative of the problems that have been plaguing the band for an indeterminate time - Russell feels his talent has allowed him to grown beyond the band's limits and Jeff feels Russell is overshadowing his bandmates.-Following the argument, Russell and William end up at a house party in Topeka, KS, where he drops acid and climbs up on a rooftop, proclaiming to be a 'golden god.' (Moments later he jumps off the roof into the swimming pool.) William calls Dick, who comes to the house & convinces Russell to return to the band. Back on the tour bus, the tension between the band members and their entourage is palatable but they all seem to reconcile when they sing Elton John's ""Tiny Dancer"" together. William tells Penny he still has to go home and she sweetly tells him ""You *are* home.""-The record company sends a renowned band manager named Dennis Hope (Jimmy Fallon) to replace their current manager, Dick Roswell (Noah Taylor). The band is apprehensive, but give in to Dennis' grand plan for the band to make more money, turning them away from their philosophy of playing 'for the fans.' Dennis is also instrumental in adding more tour dates, getting the band better treatment from concert promoters and stage managers, and the band ditches their beloved tour bus 'Doris' in favor of an airplane.As the tour winds down, William is able to interview almost everyone, but still is not able to get his key interview with Russell. What should have been a simple task becomes mind-numbing, as William is swept up with the tour, causing him to field questions from Ben Fong-Torres about the story, and rousing the ire and worry of his mother (who in one of her classes, proclaims: ""rock stars have kidnapped my son""). One night while he talks to his mother, Russell seizes the phone from William and tries to reason with Elaine, who immediately cuts through Russell's charm and lectures him on being more responsible, however respectfully. Russell is somewhat shaken by the conversation.At one of the stops, William is privy to a poker game, in which Dick and Russell wager Penny Lane and the Band-Aides in a game without Penny or the girls knowing. The girls must leave the tour before they arrive in New York where Russell's wife will meet the band. The band Humble Pie ends up ""winning"" them, and pays Dick and Russell $50 and a case of Heineken beer. William tries to put this out of his mind, but upon hearing how Penny seems to have stepped over the line of supporting the band and fallen for Russell, tells her about the bargain Russell and Dick struck. The news has a devastating effect on Penny, however she takes it good-naturedly at first, asking ""What kind of beer?"" she & the girls were wagered for.The girls do not accompany the band to New York, but upon getting to the hotel where the band is staying, William runs into Vic, who tells him that Penny Lane is staying at the Plaza Hotel, under the name Emily Rugburn.William then gets a call from Jann Wenner, chief editor of Rolling Stone and Fong-Torres, telling him that the band will grace the cover of their next issue, and that he is permitted to share this news with the band.At a restaurant in New York, this news is met with enthusiasm by the band. However, Russell's girlfriend, Leslie (Liz Strauber) sees Penny in a nearby corner watching Russell. Dick goes over to talk with Penny, who rushes off. William takes off after her and finds her in the Plaza Hotel, where she has overdosed on Quaaludes. William manages to keep Penny conscious until the doctors get there, and after pumping her stomach to get the pills out, Penny and William go for a walk through Central Park, where she tells William the story behind her real name, 'Lady Goodman,' proclaiming that he now knows 'all her secrets.' After their stroll, William takes Penny to the airport, where she flies home to San Diego.William joins the band on the plane as they fly to a new venue. Everyone questions where William went in the middle of dinner the previous night -- he missed meeting Bob Dylan -- but he is hesitant to tell them what happened. Suddenly, the plane is caught on the edge of a storm, violently shaking everyone around. Feeling like the plane may crash or break up at any moment, everyone begins to reveal secrets. Dennis reveals that he once hit a man with a car and kept on driving, not taking responsibility for the accident. Dick reveals that he took more money than his regular fee, claiming 'he knew he earned it.' Jeff reveals that he slept with Dick's wife after they broke up, and also slept with Leslie. Two more in the band also reveal they slept with Dick's wife. Jeff, in a moment of rage at Russell, reveals his true anger at Russell, and tells Leslie that Russell had been sleeping with Penny. William, angered at how the band treated Penny, finally tells them what happened to her, and proclaims his love for her. Ed Vallencourt (John Fedevich), who has been silent for some time, comes out of the closet.After Ed speaks, the plane makes it through the weather, and everyone stays silent, not speaking for the remainder of the flight. When the plane lands, Russell tells William, that he can write whatever he wants in regards to the band.Exhausted, William reports to Rolling Stone's headquarters in San Francisco, armed with his notes, but still without his key interview with Russell. The editors are astonished to see that William is so young and their fact-checker rants about his notes, saying that they're so disorganized that she'll have a difficult time doing her job. William asks for a single night to finish the piece, and calls Lester Bangs, who tells him to be honest and truthful, suggesting that William shouldn't have allowed himself to befriend the band.The story that William types reveals everything, including Russell's 'golden god' speech and the airplane confessions. Once the band is contacted by Rolling Stone's fact-checker (Erin Foley), the band denies 90% of the story, and William is sent back to San Diego. At the airport, he runs into his sister Anita. Anita offers to take William on an adventure to anywhere... but the only place he wants to go is home. Anita joins William and they go to their home where Anita and Elaine reconcile and William crashes in his own bed.Sometime after, as Stillwater is going their separate ways, one Band-aide whom Penny knows named Sapphire (Fairuza Balk) meets up with Russell, chastising him for what happened to Penny as well as his ruining Williams' story. Nearby, some new groupies are mingling with the band. Sapphire comments how the new girls are not really fans, seeing as they don't love the music, are only into sex without birth control & selfishly eat the best food the caterers offer.After talking to Sapphire, Russell is compelled to call Penny and apologize, requesting to meet her. Penny gives him an address, but it is not until he arrives there that he realizes she has given him William's address. Russell first meets Elaine, whom allows him to talk with her son after telling him sternly that William is a fine young man and a trustworthy friend. Talking with William in his room, Russell explains that he retracted his statement to Rolling Stone, confirming that the story was true. William then takes the opportunity to get what he never could before: a one-on-one interview with Russell about what he loves about music. Russell eagerly agrees and tells William that he loves ""everything"" about music.The film then ends with a montage of different clips that play over Led Zeppelin's ""Tangerine"": Stillwater goes back on tour, with their old bus 'Doris' as their main mode of transportation (with their 1974 tour called the 'No More Planes Tour'). Russell and Bebe have reconciled. William sits down to breakfast with Anita and his mother, who have also reconciled. Finally, we see Penny at an airplane ticket counter, fulfilling her decision to go to Morocco."

Snatch,2000,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0208092/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Unscrupulous boxing promoters, violent bookmakers, a Russian gangster, incompetent amateur robbers and supposedly Jewish jewelers fight to track down a priceless stolen diamond. Turkish and his close friend/accomplice Tommy get pulled into the world of match fixing by the notorious Brick Top. Things get complicated when the boxer they had lined up gets badly beaten by Mickey, who comes into the equation after Turkish, an unlicensed boxing promoter wants to buy a caravan off of Travellers. They then try to convince Mickey not only to fight for them, but to lose for them too. Whilst all this is going on, a huge diamond heist takes place, and a fistful of motley characters enter the story, including 'Cousin Avi', 'Boris The Blade', 'Franky Four Fingers' and 'Bullet Tooth Tony'. Things go from bad to worse as it all becomes about the money, the guns, and the damned dog.—Filmtwob <webmaster@filmfreak.co.za> Turkish, an unlicenced boxing promoter is pulled into trouble when he becomes involved in big time criminal Brick Top, who wants him to arrange a fight and fix it. Meanwhile, a diamond theft goes down but the 84 karat stone goes missing. This leads Avi, the boss who was supposed to receive the stone, to come to England to search for it, with the help of his cousin, Doug The Head and Bullet Tooth Tony. As events twist and turn, the two situations blending into one with a chain reaction of events carrying on for each and each every character.—~^Æ~§íX~^Æ~ The film opens as we see boxing promoter Turkish (Jason Statham) and his naive partner Tommy (Stephen Graham), sitting nervously before an unseen man, in London. Turkish gives a brief narration about the circumstances, then the movie really takes off. We then jump to Antwerp, where gangster and compulsive gambler Frankie Four Fingers (Benicio Del Toro) and his buddies, dressed like rabbis, pull off a daring robbery and nab an 86-karat diamond (throughout the rest of the film, it's either 86-karat or 84-karat, depending on which character states it, or it loses value after going through so many hands). One of Frankie's men is the brother of ex-KGB gangster Boris the Blade (Rade Serbedzija), aka Boris the Bullet-Dodger, named due to his unique ability to defy death. Boris is now in the business of selling guns on the blackmarket, and lures Frankie to buy a gun, in order to steal the diamond.Meanwhile, Frankie has contacted jewelry retailer Doug the Head (Mike Reid) about the diamond. Doug lives in the Jewish community of London, although he himself is not even Jewish. Nevertheless, Doug contacts his Cousin Avi (Dennis Farina) in New York about the diamond. Avi sounds very interested, and tells Doug to keep Frankie close and interested in selling.At the same time, Turkish and Tommy are preparing for a big bout, using their premier boxer, Gorgeous George. Tommy is being overprotective these days, and carries a small firearm that he bought from Boris the Blade. Turkish and Tommy run a legitimate slot machine business on the side, to compensate for the illegal boxing that they participate in, and their office is a run-down caravan. Turkish is unimpressed by doing deals in such a crappy environment, so he urges Tommy to go buy a new caravan from a traveling band of gypsies (or pikies, as everyone else calls them). Tommy goes to the campsite, accompanied by Gorgeous George. It's there that they meet One Punch Mickey O'Neil (Brad Pitt), a tough, indecipherable part-time pugilist. Tommy buys the caravan, but as he and Gorgeous George are leaving, the wheels of the caravan almost immediately fall off. Tommy asks for the money back, but Mickey refuses. Gorgeous George demands the money back, and starts throwing his weight around, unti Mickey decides that he and Gorgeous George fight for it. They have a bare-knuckle brawl, and while Mickey is still removing his hat and shirt, Goregous George starts throwing punches. He beats Mickey up for awhile, until Mickey lays just one punch into Gorgeous George, knocking him out cold. Tommy reports back to Turkish about the bad news regarding Gorgeous George, but tells Turkish about Mickey's mean left cross. With Gorgeous George out of commission, Turkish is in dutch with debt to. Brick Top is very pissed that Gorgeous George is not going to fight, due to all the bets that were placed on him. Turkish, desperate, turns to Mickey, who says he'll do the fight if Turkish buys his mother a new caravan. Brick Top is not too impressed by this change in the cast, but allows Mickey to fight in place of Gorgeous George, granted that Mickey will take the dive in the fourth round.During his meeting with Frankie, Boris the Blade convinces the gambler to go place a bet on the fights that night. Frankie is interested, and does so. To get the diamond, Boris hires inept pawnbrokers, Vinny (Robbie Gee) and Sol (Lennie James), to rob the bookie and steal the briefcase (containing the diamond) from Frankie. Boris gets the briefcase (its contents unknown to Vinny and Sol) and the pawnbrokers get the cash, roughly 10,000 pounds. Vinny and Sol enlist a getaway driver named Tyrone (Ade), a man so large he has trouble getting out of the car. Also along for the ride is a dog that Vinny found. The dog is very restless, always chewing and biting things, and even swallows its squeaky toy, making it squeak whenever it barks.Frankie parks his van in front of the bookie's, and goes to the back to change. Just then, the pawnbrokers crash into his van, knocking Frankie out cold. The pawnrokers stakeout the bookie's, until it's time.Meanwhile, Turkish is very nervous about the fight, and urges Mickey continuously to go down in the fourth. Mickey just nods. When the fight begins, Mickey throws the first punch, and knocks the other fighter out cold. Now, Turkish and Tommy are in big trouble. Brick Top is not very happy.Vinny and Sol finally decide to rob the bookie's. When they enter the building and draw their guns, the girl working the counter immediately hits the alarm, closing off all of the windows and doors, trapping Vinny and Sol inside. Vinny is actually trapped in the closed window, half of his body hanging out. Sol blows a hole in the wall with his shotgun, and tells the girl to lower the window so Vinny can get free. She does, Vinny falls to the ground, and Sol tells the girl to hand over the money. She says there is no money, since all bets are off. There's only a few coins. When Sol accidentally places his shotgun down for a second, the girl grabs it, fires at them, and closes the window. Sol fires his pistol at the door trying to break the glass, but the bullet ricochets, hitting Vinny in the leg. Both men take off their masks, only to see the security camera looking straight at them. Suddenly, Tyrone pushes the door open, and the three run back to the car. As they are preparing to leave, they see Frankie, now awake, exiting his van. Tyrone walks up to him and knocks him out cold with the butt of his pistol. He tries taking the briefcase, but it's attached to Frankie's arm, so Tyrone puts Frankie's unconscious body in the car with him and the pawnbrokers.Back in New York, Avi is hounding Doug the Head about the whereabouts of Frankie. Doug says he's looking, but can't find him. Actually, Doug isn't looking, and Avi knows this, so he flies to London himself. Avi reems out Doug about not finding the diamond, and sets his sights on getting it himself.At the pawnshop, Vinny, Sol and Tyrone have Frankie tied to a chair, a sack over his head. Boris the Blade enters, and asks why they brought Frankie with them, instead of just cutting off his arm and taking the briefcase. Vinny tells Boris there was no money at the bookie, so Boris compensates them with the 10,000 pounds in cash upfront. Vinny declines, saying that he and his pals are more interested in the diamond. They opened the case, and found the stone, and demand half of whatever it's worth. Boris explains that whatever is in the briefcase is his, but Vinny won't listen and walks away. Boris, angry but cool about it, pulls out his gun, and shoots Frankie in the head. The pawnbrokers are now scared out of their wits. Boris demands the diamond, but the pawnbrokers had put it back in the briefcase and only Frankie knew the combination. Boris, getting very agitated, pulls out a meat cleaver, and hacks off Frankie's arm. He takes the briefcase, with the arm still attached, and tells the pawnbrokers they can keep the 10,000 pounds, as well as the body. It's now their problem.Turkish returns home, and finds Brick Top with two of his goons waiting for him. Brick Top explains that Turkish is in deep trouble, however, Brick Top was impressed by Mickey's style, and tells Turkish that he wants to use the gypsy in a bare-knuckle fight coming up, with Mickey still going down in the fourth. Turkish agrees, and Brick Top leaves, but not until taking most of Turkish's money to compensate for Mickey's stubborness. Now, Brick Top wants to know who tried to hit the bookie, so he and his goons watch the security tape. They don't recognize Sol and Vinny, but one of the goons recognizes Tyrone when he opened the door.Turkish and Tommy venture back out to the campsites, and find Mickey and his friends ""coursing"" , a game that involves hungry dogs chasing a hare. Turkish asks Mickey to fight in the bare-knuckle brawl. Mickey tells the promoters that he still wants the caravan for his mother, but he'll place a bet about his conditions of fighting. If the hare gets away, Turkish has to pay up, but if the dogs capture the hare, Mickey will fight for free. They let the hare go, and the dogs chase after it. This scene is intercut with Brick Top's goons locating, chasing and capturing Tyrone, putting him in a hole with angry dogs. Tyrone tells Brick Top everything about the robbery. At the same time, the hare, after some close calls, escapes with its life. Turkish has to look into getting the caravan. On the drive back to town, Tommy tries to test out the gun that Boris sold to him, but it's defective and won't fire.Avi, growing very upset with Doug, decides to hire a troubleshooter by the name of Bullet-Tooth Tony (Vinnie Jones), who, as legend has it, took six bullets in one sitting, and survived. Tony agrees to work for Avi, and the two, along with Avi's sidekick, Rosebud, go to get information. Tony grabs a con named Mullet (Ewen Bremner, ""Spud"" from ""Trainspotting"") off the street, traps his head in the car window, and drives down the street, with Mullet running along side the car, until Mullet spills the beans, and reveals to them about the pawnbrokers.Back at the pawnshop, Vinny and Sol are trying to dispose of Frankie's body, when suddenly Brick Top walks in. He explains to them the best way to dispose of the body is to feed the flesh to pigs. That's his method, anyways. Brick Top leads them to their outer office, where a group of goons wait, with bodybags, butcher knives, etc., basically preparing for the pawnbrokers' demise. Sol, in desperation, tells Brick Top about the diamond, and says that he and Vinny can get it for him in four days. Brick Top agrees, but gives them 48 hours instead.Turkish tells Brick Top the demands regarding the upcoming bout. He says that Mickey's mother wants a new caravan. Brick Top is very pissed that Turkish would have the balls to demand things of him, so he decides to put his message across. Some goons smash up Turkish's slot machines. Turkish knocks two of them out, but they eventually nab him, and are about to cut off his arm, when Tommy walks in, with his defective gun, and gets him and Turkish out of there. Brick Top also wants to make clear to Mickey about his point, so he burns down Mickey's mother's caravan...with his mother inside. Mickey tries to save her, but his friends hold him back, as the flames grow higher.Tony and Avi go over to the pawnbrokers, where Vinny reveals, with Tony's gun to his head, that it was all Boris the Blade's idea. Tony is surprised to hear this name, and tells Avi about Boris. While they are waiting at Doug the Head's jewelry shop, they see Boris enter on the security camera. Rosebud says he'll take care of Boris. The next cut shows Rosebud, Tony and Avi in the car, all a little beaten up. They got Boris, though, and put him in their trunk, with a little difficulty. They go over to Boris' house, and get the diamond.The pawnbrokers don't have any guns, but they purchase some replicas with extra loud blanks to get back the diamond from Boris. They're tipped off by Tyrone that he found Boris, but he wasn't alone. That's when the bizarre car montage begins...The pawnbrokers are following Avi and Tony when suddenly they hit someone standing in the street.Turkish and Tommy are driving along in their Land Rover, and Tommy is explaining why it's bad for Turkish to drink milk. Tommy grabs the milk, and tosses it out of the window, only to hear a crash.Tony is driving Avi and Rosebud, and Avi says that he wants to kill Boris. Tony suggests shooting him. Avi says it's too loud. Tony suggests stabbing. Avi says it's too cold-blooded. Tony says they should stab him, and tells Rosebud to pull out a blade from under the seat. Rosebud pulls out a large sword, when suddenly...a carton of milk splashes onto the windshield, causing Tony to crash. Tony and Avi are fine, but Rosebud is dead, the sword sticking out of him. Avi looks across the street and sees Boris, tied up with a sack over his head, walking around, until suddenly hit, by the pawnbroker's car.Turkish and Tommy are now at Boris', with Tommy ready to demand his money back for the defective gun. Suddenly, Boris, still very much alive and angry, walks by them. Tommy tries to talk to him, but Boris racks him. Boris walks inside his house, and grabs a large assault rifle, like the one in ""Scarface.""Tony and Avi, trying to keep it cool, go into a nearby pub to clean up. Avi goes to the bathroom with the diamond. Tony goes to the bar, and orders a pint. The pawnbrokers walk in, in masks with their replicas, and point them at Tony, who is very calm. They demand to know where the diamond is, but Tony says that they're not going to get anywhere with those guns, considering they have ""replica"" written down the side of them. Tony draws their attention to his gun, which has Desert Eagle .50 written down the side of it. The pawnbrokers leave, but while they are in the hall, Avi opens the bathroom door. The pawnbrokers point their replicas at Avi, and demand the diamond. Avi says they're going to have to shoot him. Suddenly, Boris enters, with his assault rifle, and he's about to shoot everyone. Tony is in the other room, but can hear everything. He finds the hall door is locked, and yells for Avi to grab his socks (""get down!""). Avi and the pawnbrokers drop to the ground, as Tony fires round after round through the wall, hitting Boris. Vinny and Sol get up, grab the case, and run, leaving Tyrone behind. Tony walks into the hallway, reloads, and shoots Boris a few more times. But Boris is still alive. It takes the entire round, and a shot to the head to finally kill Boris the Bullet-Dodger. Tony also tries to shoot Tyrone, but the gun is empty.Vinny and Sol, now that they have the diamond, are about to give it to Brick Top, when Tony suddenly appears. Vinny hides the diamond in his pants, and tells Sol to tell Tony and Avi it's back at the pawnshop. They all go back to the pawnshop. Vinny's dog has torn the place up, shredding papers and defecating on the floor. Avi tells Tony to open a window. Vinny says the diamond is missing, the dog must have eaten it. Avi tells Tony to open the dog up, but Vinny resists. There's a lot of commotion, and Vinny finally hands the diamond over to Avi. Avi admires the diamond, but the dog suddenly jumps up and grabs the diamond with its mouth. Avi is very angry now, and grabs Tony's gun and starts firing everywhere. The dog jumps out of the open window. Avi tells Tony to follow him, but Tony isn't going anywhere. Avi realizes that he just accidently killed Tony. This sends Avi back to New York.During O'Neil's wake, Mickey gets very, very drunk. Turkish and Tommy wake him up, and get him ready for the fight. Brick Top tells the gypsy to do as he says, considering there's a handful of men waiting at the campground, armed and awaiting Brick Top's instructions to kill the other gypsies, should Mickey disobey him. Mickey once again must go down in the fourth. Turkish yells at Mickey not to knock the other fighter out. The bout begins, and Mickey once again opens with his mean left cross, knocking the other fighter down, but not out. The fight really starts, and the two are merely trading licks. Mickey is not fighting like he normally does, and is soon taking a beating. Finally, in the fourth round, after taking some mighty hits, Mickey is knocked hard to the ground. As he hits the ground, the floor of the mat suddenly turns into water, and Mickey is swimming underwater, looking above to see himself lying down with the other fighter above him. All Mickey has to do now is stay down. However, Mickey swims back up into his body, and, with one swift punch, knocks the other fighter out cold. Brick Top rushes outside. He wants to shoot Turkish, Mickey and Tommy as they are leaving. Brick Top calls one of his men on his cell phone, and hears gunfire. He hangs up, and as Turkish, Mickey, and Tommy are getting to their car, Brick Top knocks on the window of his car, and demands that his goon give him a gun. Suddenly, there's a shot.We then retrace back, with Turkish's narration, that Mickey was expecting the ambush on the campsite. The other gypsies surround Brick Top's men, and blow them away. When Brick Top called one of his men, Mickey's buddy answers, and says that Brick Top is going to speak up if his friend wants to hear him. Mickey's friend then shoots Brick Top's man. The gypsies are also waiting in Brick Top's car, and when Brick Top demands a gun, one of the gypsies roll down the window, and shoots Brick Top in the face. Mickey takes off with the gypsies, leaving Turkish and Tommy a bit confused.The next day, Turkish and Tommy go to the campsite, to find it abandoned. The gypsies left in the middle of the night. Some police officers arrive, and ask Turkish what he's doing there. Suddenly, Turkish spots Vinny's dog, and tells the officer he was walking his dog. Tommy grabs the dog, and he and Turkish leave, only to pass by Vinny and Sol by their car on the side of the road, being questioned by cops why they have a dead man missing his arm in their trunk. Turkish goes on to explain that Tommy wanted to keep the dog, but Turkish made it go to the vet, to stop the squeaking. While at the vet, they discovered the diamond, and now we are back to the first scene of the film, with Turkish and Tommy sitting nervously across from an unseen man. Turkish is inquiring about the diamond, and the camera does a quick dolly to reveal Doug the Head, who says he might know someone interested in it. We cut back to see Avi boarding a plane for London."

Thirty-something Rob Gordon, a former club DJ, owns a not-so-lucrative used record store in Chicago. He not so much employs Barry and Dick, but rather keeps them around as they showed up at the store one day and never left. All three are vinyl and music snobs, but in different ways. Rob has a penchant for compiling top-five lists. The latest of these lists is his top-five break-ups, it spurred by the fact that his latest girlfriend, Laura, a lawyer, has just broken up with him. He believed that Laura would be the one who would last, partly as an expectation of where he would be at this stage in his life. Rob admits that there have been a few incidents in their relationship which in and of themselves could be grounds for her to want to break up. To his satisfaction, Laura is not on this top-five list. Rob feels a need not only to review the five relationships, which go back as far as middle school when he was 12, and try to come to terms with why the woman, or girl as the case may be, left him, but also, in the words of Charlie Nicholson, number four on the list, ""what it all means"" for why he has ended up where he is, which is nowhere, personally or professionally, close to what he envisioned. He also has to come to terms with what it means that Laura has moved on to Ian Raymond, a man for whom neither had any respect when they were together. High Fidelity follows the 'mid-life' crisis of Rob, a thirty-something record-store owner who must face the undeniable facts - he's growing up.

Helping Rob in his task of musical elitism are Dick (Todd Louiso) and Barry (Jack Black), the ""musical moron twins,"" as he refers to them. Dick is quiet and reserved, Barry is loud, boisterous and confrontational.

In the end, Rob lets Ian say his piece and leave unharmed.Rob soon hears that Laura's father, who liked Rob, has died, and attends his funeral with Laura. Shortly after the reception, Rob realizes he never committed to Laura and always had one foot out the door. In the process, he neglected his own future.

The movie begins to play with the credits first -- in backward order. Some functions (fast forward, chapter skip, etc.) are disabled.This synopsis describes the scenes in chronological order. It is not the plot order presented in the film.The story starts in black and white. Leonard Shelby wakes up in a room at the Discount Inn puzzled as to why he is there. The phone rings and he speaks with an unknown caller. He tells the caller that he suffers from anterograde amnesia, a condition which makes him unable to create new memories. He describes the condition by detailing the story of Sammy Jankis (Stephen Tobolowsky), who had the same problem.Leonard describes how one must have a system of notes to deal with the problems and a drive to use them. Leonard says he has the drive that Sammy never had and the viewer sees Leonard's tattoo: ""JOHN G. RAPED AND MURDERED MY WIFE"" as well as other clues and notes tattooed on his body.Leonard continues the story and explains that he had just become an insurance investigator when he met Sammy and was assigned to determine whether his condition was covered by his insurance policy. Sammy's condition was not like other cases of anterograde amnesia in that Sammy was unable to learn through conditioning. After additional testing, Leonard says he concluded that Sammy's condition was psychological and the claim was denied because Sammy was not covered for mental illness.Leonard explains how Mrs. Jankis (Harriet Sansom Harris) met privately with him. In trying to placate her, Leonard told her that Sammy should be able to make new memories. She tested Sammy's memory by repeatedly asking him to give her insulin injections. She lapsed into a coma and never recovered from the overdose. Sammy was then confined to a mental institution.During this conversation, the caller and Leonard talk about Leonard's quest and how the police did not believe the story about the second attacker. The caller identifies himself as a policeman and provides Leonard with additional clues for his quest. Leonard tattoos the fact the second attacker was a drug dealer. The caller identifies the second attacker as Jimmy Grantz and tells Leonard that he has set up a meeting with Jimmy. Leonard agrees to meet the caller in the motel lobby.In the lobby, Leonard meets a man (Joe Pantoliano) and asks him if he is Officer Gammell. The man insists that Leonard should call him Teddy since he is undercover. Teddy gives Leonard directions to the meeting location and Leonard goes to meet Jimmy at an abandoned building outside of town.When Jimmy Grantz (Larry Holden) arrives, he recognizes Leonard as the man with the memory condition, demands to know what Leonard is doing there, and asks where Teddy is. Leonard threatens Jimmy with a tire iron and tells him to strip. Jimmy pleads for his life and tells Leonard that there is $200,000 in the trunk of his car for payment of the drugs that Teddy was to have brought to the meeting. Leonard strangles Jimmy, takes a Polaroid photo of his body, and starts putting on Jimmy's clothes. As the photo of Jimmy's body develops, the film gradually goes from black and white into color.The remaining story is in color, but proceeds in the film in reverse order.As Leonard drags Jimmy into the basement, he hears Jimmy whisper ""Sammy..."" before dying. Leonard concludes that if Jimmy knew about Sammy, he was not the second attacker.Teddy arrives at the scene and tries to convince Leonard that Jimmy was the man he was after. Leonard does not believe him. Teddy finally admits that Jimmy Grantz was a drug dealer who did not have anything to do with his wife's killing. Teddy then tells Leonard that his wife survived the attack. According to Teddy, Sammy Jankis was a fraud who was not even married and it was Leonard's wife who was diabetic. Teddy claims to be the police officer who investigated his wife's murder. He says he believed him about the second attacker and helped him track down and kill the real John G. more than a year ago. Teddy claims that he took a picture of a happy Leonard right after the second attacker was dead. Leonard forgot the killing and began searching for the dead John G. all over again. Teddy tells Leonard there are plenty of John Gs to find and admits that he is even a John G: his full name is John Edward Gammell and his mother calls him Teddy.Before Lenny can forget Teddy's revelations, he decides to continue the hunt, lying to himself to set himself up to kill Teddy. He puts a note on Teddy's photo saying ""Don't believe his lies,"" records Teddy's license plate number as John G's, and leaves himself a reminder to get a tattoo of the plate number, SG137IU. Leonard ditches Teddy by throwing Teddy's car keys into some weeds. Leonard then leaves his pickup truck at the refinery and drives away in Jimmy's Jaguar, still wearing Jimmy's clothes.After forgetting Teddy's revelations and the lies to himself, Leonard finds a tattoo parlor and has the license plate number tatooed onto his leg. Teddy sees the Jaguar parked outside and comes in, trying to move the car and get Lenny to get out of town in some new clothes. Leonard sees the note on the back of Teddy's pictures and decides to leave without him.Leonard finds a note in the pocket of Jimmy's suit coat, which he is wearing. The note is from a Natalie telling Jimmy to come to Ferdy's bar. Not realizing he is wearing Jimmy's clothes and driving Jimmy's car, Leonard thinks the note is for him and goes to meet Natalie (Carrie-Anne Moss). He tells her about his condition. Natalie believes his story after a test.Natalie takes Leonard to her home and tells him he can stay with her. Leonard recounts what he remembers of the attack. He says he awoke to sounds, got a gun, and found his wife being strangled. Leonard shot one intruder, but a second man clubbed him with a sap and smashed his head into a mirror. He goes on to explain that the cops did not believe there was a second attacker. Leonard tells Natalie that the second attacker was too smart and left the evidence to look like there was only one intruder.Natalie tricks Leonard into going after a man named Dodd (Callum Keith Rennie), who she claims has been harassing her for the money from Jimmy's prior drug deals. Leonard leaves to look for Dodd. Teddy is waiting for him as he leaves Natalie's home. Teddy tries to warn Leonard about Natalie, but after seeing the ""Don't believe his lies"" note on Teddy's picture, Leonard does not believe him. Leonard does decide he shouldn't stay with Natalie and follows Teddy's advice to go to the Discount Inn.Leonard goes to the Discount Inn. Though Leonard has already paid for a room, Burt (Mark Boone Junior) at the front desk takes advantage of his condition by renting him a second room. Leonard calls an escort service. When the escort arrives, Leonard explains to her that he wants only to relive going to sleep the night of the attack. After falling asleep, the escort wakes him. He asks the escort to leave. He then takes personal items belonging to his wife to a reservoir and burns them.In the morning, Leonard leaves the reservoir and is spotted by Dodd. Leonard escapes Dodd and goes to Dodd's motel to wait for him. When Dodd returns to his motel room, Leonard beats him and ties him up. Leonard calls Teddy for help in dealing with Dodd. Teddy comes to Dodd's motel room. Leonard and Teddy convince Dodd to leave town.Returning the favor of getting rid of Dodd, Leonard spends the night at Natalie's. In the morning she agrees to trace the license plate number tatooed on Leonard's leg. Later that day, Natalie gives him the information along with directions to ""an abandoned place outside of town"" where a guy she knew ""used to do bigger deals"". Leonard takes it back to his motel. At the motel, Leonard puts the clues together and concludes that Teddy is John Edward Gammell and must be the second attacker. He calls Teddy and they go to the same abandoned building where Jimmy Grantz was killed a few days earlier. Leonard shoots Teddy in the head."

Titan A.E.,2000,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120913/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A young man learns that he has to find a hidden Earth ship before an enemy alien species does in order to secure the survival of humanity. Earth is a memory of the past; it's the 31st Century and humanity is on the brink of total annihilation, all except for one young man who holds the map to the universe's last hope: Titan. In a race against time, the human race has to find the Titan before the illusive Drej destroy it.—Johnny One thousand years from now, aliens destroy Earth in fear of the Titan project. Some humans escape, becoming a downtrodden Diaspora, living in impoverished settlements. The mysterious Titan spacecraft also escapes, and its inventor has hidden it before dying. A spacecraft captain and its pilot, Korso and Akima, two humans, seek out Cale, the youthful son of the dead scientist and explain that he must help them find the Titan, which holds a mechanism to unite and save humanity. Cale refuses, but the arrival of the killer aliens persuades him to join Korso. Can he avoid his pursuers, know friend from foe, find the Titan, and embrace his humanity, a nature he has despised until now?—<jhailey@hotmail.com> By the year 3028 A.D., deep space travel and interaction with a plethora of alien races is commonplace for humanity and, as often happens with the passage of time, a new discovery is made. As electricity and splitting the atom were in history, what comes to be known as the Titan Project proves to be a profound scientific advance in mankind's role in the universe; a testament to their strength and imagination. However, it is explained that this marvel does not go unnoticed. The Drej, an alien race comprised entirely of energy, deems the human race a threat and advance their armada on Earth to destroy the Titan Project and what they see as mankind's last chance of being a dominant force in the galaxy.Five year-old Cale (Alex D. Linz) puts the last touches on his latest invention, a hydro-powered console, before it accidentally breaks in a small creek. His father, Sam Tucker (Ron Perlman) comes to collect him, explaining that they have to leave. He takes his son to the nearby base at Pierce, Colorado, where he is stationed and where evacuation pods filled with people are being sent into space. Sam places Cale in the care of family friend and guardian Tek (Tone Loc) before explaining that he has to go away for a while. He gives Cale a gold ring and tells him that, as long as he wears it, there will be hope. Then, despite Cale's pleas, Sam is escorted by friend Joseph Korso (Bill Pullman) to a nearby hangar as Cale is brought aboard an evacuation pod with Tek. The Drej have arrived at Earth in their huge mothership and reports of Drej fighters attacking civilian pods ring out as Cale's ship takes off. He watches as his father runs inside and activates the Titan Project; a large, spherical ship which manages to fly past the incoming Drej and uses its hyperdrive to vanish into outer space. At a safe distance, Cale watches as the Drej mothership, commanded by the Queen Drej (Christopher Scarabosio), targets Earth's North Pole and destroys the planet and the Moon in one shot with a massive energy blast.Fifteen years later, Cale (Matt Damon) works in a salvage yard in asteroid belt Tau 14. The human population, spread throughout the galaxy, has dwindled severely over the past few years and the race is considered inferior to other alien species, constantly ridiculed and rumored to be near extinction. Impatient and tired of constantly being shoved to the back of the line, Cale defiantly rides his scooter away from the check-out point to the nearest hangar entrance, only to collide with a docking ship. He is propelled onto the bow of the ship and briefly gets a glimpse of a beautiful, young female pilot within before she closes the shield doors. The pilot then sends a com-link message to the disembarking captain, reminding him that they are on a time schedule. Cale makes it inside and begins to wash up before he's confronted by two fellow alien workers who express distaste with Cale's line-jumping stunt. They begin to beat him up to teach him a lesson before the captain of the newly-arrived ship intervenes and lassos the aliens. He introduces himself as Joseph Korso and says he's been searching for Cale who carries mankind's last salvation. Skeptical and disheartened to hear that Korso was a friend of his father's, Cale refuses to cooperate and reunites with Tek in the galley who seems rather disinterested in Cale's complaints.Korso, meanwhile, is alerted by pilot Akima (Drew Barrymore) that their time limit has been cut with the arrival of a few Drej fighters. Korso follows Cale into the galley and greets Tek as an old friend, much to Cale's astonishment. Korso then shows Cale the reason he's there; he takes Cale's ring and uses a pen to activate a minute code within the lining before replacing it on Cale's finger. The ring projects a holographic map onto the palm of Cale's hand. Korso explains that the ring was coded to Cale's father's DNA and thence to Cale himself. The map is supposed to lead to where Sam hid the Titan and, if they find it before the Drej do, they will be able to give the human race something they haven't had in years; a new planet to call home. At that moment, two Drej soldiers enter the galley and immediately target Cale. Korso disables the artificial gravity generator at the back of the kitchen and he and Cale follow the cowardly cook (Jim Breuer) through an escape hatch. They make it to a warehouse and hijack a construction vehicle with the Drej in hot pursuit. Cale is injured in the escape and Korso pilots the vehicle straight through a closed dock and into space. He calls for Akima to pick them up as the windshield on the vehicle cracks. Korso kicks it out and uses a fire extinguisher to propel himself and Cale into the hold of his ship, the Valkyrie.When Cale wakes, he meets Akima along with the sly first mate, Preed (Nathan Lane), before he is introduced to the rest of the crew including Stith (Janeane Garofalo), the surly weapons specialist, and Gune (John Leguizamo), the eccentric astronomer. Cale is brought to Gune who reads the map on his palm and determines that their next heading should be to Sesharrim, a planet that, as Korso recalls, is home to the ancient Gaoul race. After arriving, Preed and Gune are left at the ship to watch for the Drej while the others take a boat across a lake covered with hydrogen-pod trees. They find the remnants of a temple and are suddenly surrounded by silent, bat-like creatures. Before Korso can open fire, Akima determines that they are the Gaoul. The lead Gaoul approaches Cale and instructs him through pantomime to hold his palm up towards the planet's prominent star. Held against the sky, Cale sees the arrow on the map pointing towards the distant Andali Nebula where the Titan is surely hidden. Suddenly, Drej fighters descend on the planet and attack the group. The Gaoul assist the group escape to their boat as Preed and Gune, having been distracted from their post, struggle to get the Valkyrie airborne again. The Gaoul use the hydrogen pods on the trees to destroy some of the fighters but, in the chaos, Cale and Akima are knocked off the boat. Before Korso can retrieve them, a Drej ship locks onto them with its tractor beam and escapes into outer space. It takes Cale and Akima to the Drej mothership where Akima, of no use, is expelled into space in a pod. Cale is then held before the Queen and forced to open his palm, giving the Drej a complete copy of the map detailing where the Titan is hidden. Cale is then sent into confinement.Meanwhile, Korso and Preed are able to track Akima's location to a prison block on a nearby planet. They attempt to disguise themselves as a slave trader and his subordinate but the guard (Charles Rocket) displays higher-than-average intelligence. So they use force and make their way towards the cell where Akima is resting atop her pod, unconscious thugs on the ground around her.On board the Drej mothership, Cale discovers that he can manipulate the energy keeping him locked inside to release himself. He escapes to the main hangar and commandeers a Drej ship, flying out into space with a scouting party. He is able to catch up to the Valkyrie although the crew nearly mistakes him for another Drej scout. Safe again, Cale and Korso have a heart-to-heart and Cale is allowed to pilot the Valkyrie through a tract of space. Putting his piloting skills to the test, Cale playfully races a band of 'space angels', creatures that dwell in nebular matter. The crew then makes a pit stop at a human drifter colony called New Bangkok to repair the ship and pick up supplies. However, as Cale and Akima return to the ship with a few necessities, they overhear Korso speaking to a holographic link with the Queen Drej. Korso argues with her that Cale is his responsibility and he alone will use him to find the Titan, though the Queen asserts that, despite their agreement, the Drej will do whatever is necessary to assure the Titan's destruction. Cale and Akima turn away straight into Preed and he leads them inside where they are confronted by Korso. Korso admits that he made a deal with the Drej; that he would lead them to the Titan with the assurance of his own survival and for the hefty bounty. No longer wanting to believe that the human race is destined for extinction, Cale fights Korso and Preed and manages to escape the ship with Akima, though she is wounded in the process. With Cale and Akima safely in New Bangkok, Korso takes the Valkyrie and leaves for the Andali Nebula.Akima and Cale are assisted by the locals including an old woman (Tsai Chin) who assures them that Akima merely needs rest. While waiting, Cale meets a young girl (Crystal Scales) and her brother who shows Cale that a little imagination is all that's needed to envision a better place to live rather than just accepting what is. Encouraged, Cale later tells Akima, fully healed, that he plans to beat Korso to the Titan using an old ship at the colony. With the help of other able-bodied humans, Cale and Akima are able to repair and refit the old Phoenix and blast off towards the Nebula.The Andali Nebula's center is a thick ring of ice crystals which makes for extremely tricky navigation. Korso and Preed struggle to maintain a steady course as Cale and Akima come up behind them. They use the reflective surface of the ice to create an illusion as they sneak right by the ship before igniting their engines full thrust and making a break for the Titan. The Valkyrie tries to follow, but the ever-shifting ice blocks their path. Cale and Akima make it to the center of the ice pack and finally discover the resting place of the Titan. They find a hatch to dock at and make their way inside. Akima finds a library stacked with vials that are revealed to be genetic information for all animals and plant life that were found on Earth. Meanwhile, the Valkyrie finds the Titan and docks at an alternate entrance. Korso and Preed prepare to disembark and instruct Gune and Stith to stay behind. However, the pair are suspicious of Korso's intentions. They are proven right when Preed sends a com-link message to Stith's watch which begins to beep in a countdown. Gune removes Stith's watch and runs off before it explodes. Stith awakes in the rubble unharmed but finds Gune injured. He announces that he needs to take a brief nap before he falls still.Cale and Akima make their way to the main console at the center of the ship where Cale finds his old invention, completely repaired, and activates a message from his father. The image explains that the ship has the power to create an entirely new planet for humans but that, in its escape, the ship used up all of its auxiliary power. He begins to go over the initiation process to restore power until a shot rings out and the message ends. Korso appears and demands Cale's ring but Preed suddenly presses his gun to Korso's head. He announces that he made a separate deal with the Drej; that he could live provided he killed everyone else before their imminent arrival. Korso fights back and manages to overpower Preed, breaking his neck. Cale then tackles Korso and they both fall over the edge of the platform. Cale is able to grab onto a piece of rigging and climb back onto the main platform but Korso falls further until he grasps a wire which leads him back onto the main console. At that moment, an alert sounds; the Drej have arrived.Stith is reunited with Cale and Akima and she activates the controls to the exterior guns, blasting away at the Drej fighters. Cale struggles to think of a way to beat the Drej and activate the Titan until he remembers that the Drej are pure energy. He is able to harness into their energy and restart the internal power system, but one of the circuit breakers located outside malfunctions. Cale has no choice but to go out and fix it manually. Stith provides cover until all guns are shot out by the Drej. Cale is cornered by Drej fire until Korso appears and offers to help. They work together to fix the circuit until Korso is gravely injured. He opts to stay behind, effectively sacrificing himself in order to connect the circuit. As Cale escapes back into the Titan, he is covered by Gune piloting the Valkyrie; announcing he'd recovered from his nap. Korso uses his gun to link the circuits and is electrocuted in the process. Cale makes it back to the main console and uses his ring to activate the ship just as the Drej mothership targets the Titan. A blast is sent out from the Titan and the Drej are disintegrated, their energy sucked into the Titan's engines. Waves of energy expand from the center of the ice ring and swirl it together towards the center. The Titan flies out of the core as gravity takes over and a new planet is formed, the remaining ice melting into vast seas.Cale and Akima step foot onto the new planet and Akima asks what they should call it. Cale decides to name the planet 'Bob', despite Akima's protests. They kiss and watch as Gune and Stith fly the Valkyrie above them in a victorious sweep. Meanwhile, ships and colonies of the surviving humans have received word of their new home and all flock to claim it. Year 16 A.E., for 'After Earth', introduces us to 'New Earth', aka 'Planet Bob'."
Billy Elliot,2000,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0249462/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A talented young boy becomes torn between his unexpected love of dance and the disintegration of his family. In County Durham, during the endless, violent 1984 strike against the Margaret Thatcher closure of British coal mines, widower Jackie Elliot Widower (Gary Lewis) and his firstborn, fellow miner Tony (Jamie Draven), take a dim view of 11-year-old second son Billy's (Jamie Bell) poor record in boxing class, which worsens when they discover he sneakily transferred to the neighboring, otherwise girls-only-attended ballet class. Only one schoolmate, closet-gay Michael Caffrey (Stuart Wells), encourages Billy's desire, aroused by the teacher, Mrs. Wilkinson (Dame Julie Walters), who judged him talented enough for private lessons, to train and try out for the world-renowned Royal Ballet audition. Only the prospect of a fancy career unimagined in the pauper quarter may twist pa and big brother's opposition to indispensable support.—KGF Vissers 1984 in the coal mining village of Evrington, Durham County, Northeast England. The only life the Elliots have known is working in the mine. Current family patriarch, widowed Jackie Elliot (Gary Lewis), and his elder son Tony Elliot (Jamie Draven) work in the mine, and Jackie's younger son, 11-year-old Billy Elliot (Jamie Bell), will probably take his place alongside his father and brother when the time comes. However, Jackie, Tony, and their fellow miners are currently in a bitter labor dispute, with the mine still operating with scab labor, which is prolonging the strike, since the company has no reason to give in to the wage demands. With the strike foremost on Jackie and Tony's minds, Billy is left largely to his own devices, his father giving him 50 pence for the community boxing class down at the boys' club when Billy is not at home looking after his Grandma (Jean Heywood), who has early-stage Alzheimer's. Learning how to box is another of the activities passed down along the male lineage of the Elliot family. However, Billy doesn't much like it and isn't very good at it, instead more interested in the movement put to music in the form of the girls' ballet class held on the other side of the gym by chain-smoking Mrs. Wilkinson (Dame Julie Walters). Soon, Billy has ditched the boxing, instead secretly attending the ballet class with Mrs. Wilkinson's blessing. She can see that Billy not only has natural talent, but passion, unlike most of the girls in the class, so much so that she believes he may have a real shot at making it into the Royal Ballet School. However, Billy has to decide whether this path is one he wants to take, especially as it means coming clean to his family, Jackie and Tony, who may feel emasculated in the process, especially if their miner friends find out, and especially in Billy's destiny as a coal miner himself. Billy's involvement in the ballet may tear the family apart in ways he didn't imagine. But Billy may get guidance in following his dreams regardless of the views of others, by his best friend Michael Caffrey (Stuart Wells), and a letter Billy's mother wrote him before she died.—Meredith Leonard In 1984, while the miners' strike rages, Billy Elliot (Jamie Bell) is a young boy living in a small County Durham town, who discovers he has a talent for ballet, much to the chagrin of his widowed father Jackie (Gary Lewis), leaving him torn between his dreams and the only life he's ever known.—Tom Daly Set against the background of the 1984 Miner's Strike, Billy Elliot (Jamie Bell) is an 11-year-old boy who stumbles out of the boxing ring and onto the ballet floor. He faces many trials and triumphs as he strives to conquer his family's set ways, inner conflict, and standing on his toes.—filmtwob <webmaster@filmfreak.co.za> The film is set during the 19841985 UK miners' strike, and centres on the character of 11-year-old Billy Elliot (Jamie Bell), his love of dance and his hope to become a professional ballet dancer. Billy lives with his widowed father Jackie (Gary Lewis), older brother Tony (Jamie Draven), and his invalid Nan (Jean Heywood), who once aspired to be a professional dancer in Durham. Both Jackie and Tony are coal miners out on strike.Jackie takes Billy to the Sports Centre to learn boxing like his father's dad, but Billy struggles and dislikes the sport. He then happens upon a ballet class that is using the gym while their usual basement studio in the Sports Centre is temporarily being used as a soup kitchen for the striking miners. Unknown to Billy's father, he joins the ballet class. When Jackie discovers this after the boxing coach mentions Billy's absence, he forbids Billy to take any more ballet. But, passionate about dancing, Billy secretly continues his lessons with his dance teacher Georgia Wilkinson's (Julie Walters) help.Georgia believes Billy is talented enough to study at the Royal Ballet School in London, but due to Tony's arrest during a skirmish between police and striking miners, Billy misses the audition. Georgia goes to Billy's house to tell Jackie about the missed opportunity. Jackie and Tony, fearing that Billy will be considered a ""poof"", are outraged at the prospect of him becoming a professional ballet dancer.Over Christmas, Billy's best friend, Michael, kisses him on the cheek. Although Billy is not gay, he is supportive of his friend. Later, Jackie sees Billy dancing in the gym and realises his son is truly gifted, and he will do whatever it takes to help Billy realise his dream. Jackie attempts to cross the picket line to pay for Billy's training, but is blocked by Tony. Instead, his fellow miners and the neighbourhood raise money for Billy, and Jackie takes him to London to audition for the Royal Ballet School. Though highly nervous, Billy performs well, but after he punches another boy in an unprovoked attack at the audition, he is sternly rebuked by the review board. However, as a final question, they ask him what it feels like when he's dancing, to which Billy responds, ""like electricity."" Billy returns home with his father. Sometime later, he receives a letter accepting him to the Royal Ballet School, and he leaves his family to go there.The film's final scene is set fourteen years later (approximately 1999), when Billy has finally attained his goal: the mature Billy (dancer/actor Adam Cooper) takes the stage to perform the lead in Matthew Bourne's Swan Lake, as Jackie, Tony, and Michael watch in the audience."
Battlefield Earth,2000,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0185183/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"It's the year 3000 A.D., and the Earth is lost to the alien race of Psychlos. Humanity is enslaved by these gold-thirsty tyrants, who are unaware that their 'man-animals' are about to ignite the rebellion of a lifetime. In the year 3000, humanity is no match for the Psychlos, a greedy, manipulative race on a quest for ultimate profit. Led by the seductive and powerful Terl, the Psychlos are stripping Earth of its resources, using the broken remnants of humanity as slaves. What is left of the human race has reverted to a primitive state, believing the invaders to be demons and technology to be evil. After humanity has all but given up any hope of freeing themselves from alien oppression, a young man named Tyler decides to leave his desolate home high in the Rocky Mountains to discover the truth, whereupon he is captured and enslaved. It is then that he decides to fight back, leading his fellow man in one final struggle for freedom.—Cheeseycom The year is 3000; Earth has lost to the brutal aliens known only as the 'Psychlos'. It's been a lifetime of hardship and enslavement for the humans, but now a resistance is brewing: and the aliens are about to face the reckoning of a lifetime. The ultimate fight for survival is about to begin.—Johnny In the year 3000, Earth has been ruled for 1,000 years by the Psychlos, a brutal race of giant humanoid aliens. The remnants of humanity are either enslaved by the Psychlos and used for manual labor or survive in primitive tribes living in remote areas outside Psychlo control. Jonnie Goodboy Tyler (Barry Pepper), a member of one such tribe, leaves his home in the Rocky Mountains on a journey of exploration. He joins forces with Carlo (Kim Coates), a hunter, but both men are captured by a Psychlo raiding party and transported to a slave camp at the Psychlos' main base on Earth, a giant dome built over the ruins of Denver, Colorado.
Terl (John Travolta), the Psychlo security chief on Earth, has been condemned by his superiors to remain indefinitely at his post on Earth as punishment for an unclear incident involving ""the Senator's daughter."" Aided by his deputy, Ker (Forest Whitaker), Terl devises a plan to buy his way off the planet by making a fortune using human slaves to mine gold in radioactive areas. Psychlos are unable to visit such areas due to the explosive interaction of the gas that they breathe with radionuclide particles. Terl selects Jonnie as his ""foreman"" for the project and gives him a Psychlo education using a rapid-learning machine. Terl gives Jonnie a party of slaves and a Psychlo flying shuttle and orders him to go out and find gold.
After learning the Psychlos' language, history, and myriad other educational forms from the rapid learning machine, Jonnie plots a human uprising against the Psychlos. He obtains gold from Fort Knox to satisfy Terl's demands, instead of mining gold as ordered. Jonnie and his followers find an abandoned underground US military base with working aircraft, weapons, fuel, and nuclear weapons. They use the base's flight simulators to train themselves in aerial combat.
After a week of training, the rebels launch a mass uprising against the Psychlos using Harrier jump-jets and other weapons. Carlo sacrifices himself to destroy the dome over Denver, and the Psychlos inside suffocate in Earth's atmosphere, which they are unable to breathe. Jonnie captures a Psychlo teleportation device and uses it to teleport an atomic bomb to the Psychlo home world. The ensuing detonation causes the entire Psychlo atmosphere to explode, wiping out the planet. Ker and Terl survive on Earth but face different fates: Ker sides with the victorious humans, while Terl is imprisoned as a hostage within a vault in Fort Knox. The film ends with the humans in control of Earth but facing an uncertain future."

Urban Legends: The Final Cut follows Amy Mayfield (Morrison), a student at Alpine University who struggles to complete her thesis film on urban legends - only to have her crew members fall prey to fatal 'accidents.' Suspicious, Amy investigates and discovers a much more sinister hand at work. Now she must unmask the killer before she, too, becomes an urban legend.—Mr. Greenshoes Studying at Alpine University, Amy Mayfield seeks help, especially from the late Travis Stark's twin brother Trevor Stark. She needs help to complete her thesis on Pendleton's 'urban legends' theme for Professor Solomon's film class.

One couple heads into the lavatory for sex when the girl sees the words ""you're going down"" written in red on a mirror. The plane starts a descent, and the couple exits the bathroom to find all of the passengers dead and the killer, a flight attendent wielding a knife, attacks them. The couple runs into the cockpit to find both pilots dead. While the boy tries to hold the killer steward off by holding the door closed, the girl gets in the pilot seat and yells ""mayday!"" over the radio. Suddenly... Toby the director yells ""Cut!"" as the camera pulls back to reveal that this whole thing is a horror movie filmed by a small college crew at Alpine University. Toby yells at his crew for not getting the shot right as well as the blond girl, Sandra Petruzzi (Jessica Cauffiel), over her motivation.When the work is completed for the day, the sound recorder Amy Mayfied (Jennifer Morrison), walks home to her doom where it's revealed that she is a aspiring filmmaker wanting to write and direct her own movie some day.The next day, Amy is in class with other film students listing to the talk of the Alfred Hitchcock Film Award and the thesis film projects. Walking back to her dorm after her late night class, Amy is given a ride by Reese Wilson (Loretta Devine), the campus security guard. The two of them talk about Pam Grier and that they are both fans of her movies. Amy tells Reese that she has a film due, but cannot think of a good story, Reese tells her that a few years ago she was the security guard at Pendleton University where a serial killer killed eight students there, but Amy dismisses it as the local urban legend of the area. Later, Amy visits her film class teacher, Professor Solomon (Hart Bochner), and gives him her idea about making a film about a killer who kills people basing them on urban legends. The professor thinks that its a great idea.That evening, film student Travis Stark (Matthew Davis) is in a local bar with his girlfriend Lisa and they talk about his films. As Lisa orders two more drinks, someone slips a pill in her drink. Travis leaves to go to work on his latest movie, and Toby (Aston Mount) walks over to Lisa to hit on her. Lisa leaves, telling him that he can pay for the drinks. She stumbles into a coatroom where an unseen person sneaks up behind her and throws a plastic bad over her head. Lisa wakes up sometime later that night in a bathtub full of ice with a wound on her stomach and sees one of her kidney's is on a plate nearby. Lisa sees someone in the other room of what appears to be an abandoned building. She crawls out of the tub and shuts the door. Lisa calls 911 on her cell phone, but the operator thinks that its a prank call and hangs up on her. Lisa tries crawling out a window when the unseen person breaks in and pulls her back in, and breaking the window. The window is slammed shut on Lisa's neck, beheading her.The next day, Amy asks Travis if he can look at her approved script. When Amy tells some fellow students about her movie, Toby pulls her aside and accuses her of stealing his horror genre and says that no one will take the Hitchcock Award away from him which he feels belongs to him and him only. Amy goes to see Travis who is upset that he got a C- on his film and asks if she knows an available cinematographer. On the set, three of the film student crew, Stan Washington (Anthony Anderson), Dirk Reynolds (Michael Bacall), as well as Sandra fake an accident in which Sandra plays dead with some blood makeup on her head. After Amy describes the scene to Sandra, the cinematographer Schorm ""Simon"" Jabuscko (Marco Hofschneider), shows up with his camera. As people are leaving for the night, Sandra returns to the set for her dorm room keys. Someone sneaks into the studio and attaches a microphone to a camera and approaches her. The next day in the screening room, Amy and her friends watch the latest footage they shot. But the footage changes to feature Sandra being chased and killed by the unseen killer. Amy thinks that it is real, but the others think is another of Sandra's practical jokes.Later that day, Amy and the others get news that Travis killed himself. Another film student, named Graham Manning (Joseph Lawrence), talks to Amy, assuring her that Sandra is probably in Los Angeles filming a bit part on the series ER. Amy goes to the campus tower where it is said that Travis shot himself over his bad grade. There, Amy has a run-in with Travis' identical twin brother, Trevor (also Mathew Davis). He tells Amy that he thinks that Travis did not kill himself, but he tells her not to tell anybody that she saw him.That evening, Amy films a scene where the students count down to the new year and scream. While Simon is outside to smoke a cigarette, the killer, wearing a fencing mask with a hooded dark-blue sweat suit, attacks him with his own camera and beats him to death with it. Amy, having heard the last part of the killer, goes outside where Simon got attacked, but the killer and Simon's body are gone. Amy notices a security camera and she goes to Reese to ask to borrow the tapes of the last hour or so of what the cameras recorded.Amy watches the tape in the studio and sees Simon killed by the hooded fencing mask killer. But the killer appears and breaks into the studio. She locks the door to the booth, but the killer breaks through. Amy is chased by the killer through the building and to the dock where she dives into a sewer piper. While running through the sewer tunnel, Amy finds Reese and the two of them go back to the recording studio, but the tapes are gone. Reese is skeptic to Amy's claims about being attacked and also says that she cannot do anything without evidence.The next morning, Amy secretly meets with Trevor again where she tells him that she thinks that Sandra and Simon are dead, but Trevor tells her that he cannot go to the police for he has a bad relationship with the local authorities for they will not believe him either. Amy thinks that the killer might be one of the students up for the Hitchcock Award.That evening, Amy and colleague Vanessa Valdeon (Eva Mendes), the boom operation on the film (whom clearly has a crush on the straight Amy), head to the ride Merry Minders, the location of the Tunnel of Terror carnival ride scene (where the urban legend has real dead bodies in a carnival fun ride). Stan and Dick arrive there to set up dead bodies, and Amy asks Graham why be brought along the odd PA Kevin (Derek Aasland). Graham is upset that Amy is pulling a power trip in front of everyone, and he leaves. Amy sees Trevor watching them from the trees, nods to him, and tells everyone that they can leave the set to get something to eat. When Stan goes off into the tunnel to fix more lights, the killer hits him on the head and electrocutes him with a sliced cable. Next, the killer attacks Dirk and pushes him against a control box, electrocuting him too. The ride's railcar stops with Amy inside and she walks out the rest of the way. Amy finds Dirk dead and is chased by the killer to the entrance where Reese is waiting. She ventures into the tunnel, but the killer has fled. The police arrive and carry away the dead Stan and Dirk while they take Amy away for questioning.The next day, Trevor meets with Amy in her room where he tells her that he followed Graham but lost him the previous night and cannot rule him out being the killer. They lie down together on Amy's bed where Amy falls asleep and has an intimate dream of her with Trevor when he suddenly stabs her. Amy wakes up in her bed alone.Amy sees a light on in the tower and finds Vanessa who says that she got Amy's note to meet with her there. Amy replies that she didn't send her any note when a dummy falls onto a table and the two girls run up to the tower followed by the killer. They hide in a room when the door is opened and the killer grabs Vanessa, but leaves Amy locked in the room. Amy breaks down the door and finds a dead Vanessa hanging from the tower bell. Amy runs outside where Reese sees her and begins to follow her.Amy finds Trevor who takes her to the library. He tells her that in his own investigation, all the dead people worked on the short film The Gods of Men, his brother's film. They watch the bad film when at the end of it, Amy notices a splice and says that it is not Travis' film. Amy and Trevor waylay Toby Melcher as he is driving to the campus by flaging him down and threaten him with a gun as another urban legend (a guy picking up a dead hitchhiker). They take him to the studio set and handcuff him to a chair and accuse him of being the killer for he is the only surviving crew member who worked on Travis' film.Just then, Professor Solomon arrives where Trevor, acting as Travis, says that Toby stole his film. Toby reminds 'Travis' that Travis only did the sound and merely gave the credit to Toby who has never seen the film. Suddenly, Solomon pulls out a gun and shoots Toby. Trevor goes for the gun and Amy runs. Solomon knocks Trevor aside and holds him at gunpoint. The professor tells Amy that many years ago, her father was one of the judges who cast the deciding vote against him for the Hitchcock Award in film school. Solomon explains what when Amy came into his office on that day with her idea about making a horror movie about an urban legend serial killer, he decided to kill all those who worked on Travis' film and frame her for the killings so he could steal Travis' film and submit it as his own. Graham comes out of hiding and swings a chair at Solomon who ducks and the four of them battle over the gun until Reese arrives and points her gun at all of them unsure who is the killer. Feigning innocence, Solomon reminds Reese that Amy is the killer because he saw her running from the tower a few hours ago when Vanessa was killed. Reese points her gun at the professor saying that she never told anyone that she even saw Amy running from the tower and the only way that Solomon knows is if he was there. Solomon punches Reese and she punches him back. During the struggle, the prop guns get mixed up with the real guns. Amy, Trevor, and Solomon each have a gun. Trevor and Solomon get a click, but nothing happens. Amy, with a gold-trimmed gun that Reese had shown her earlier, tries to pass the gun to Reese. Solomon jumps on her and gets shot in the back. Reese then places him under arrest as Amy and Trevor embrace. Graham also finds Toby whom is still alive as well.Some months later, Trevor is accepting the Alfred Hitchcock Award on behalf of his late brother's film when the creepy PA Kevin, perched high atop a walkway, attempts to shoot Trevor as he is accepting the award and gets shot by Reese. Kevin falls off the scaffolding.... into a large air bag below and Amy yells ""Cut!"" It is the last scene of Amy's very first independent funded movie titled Urban Legends with her directing, Trevor in the lead role, Toby as the assistant director, and most of the crew in acting parts, while Graham talks on his cell phone nearby as Amy's manager to discuss her film's upcoming completion and future premier.In the final scene set another few months later, a TV set showing Amy's complete film is turned off by a nurse while a dazed and near-cationic Solomon, now confined to a wheelchair from his gunshot wound, is now residing in a insane asylum having watched Amy's completed movie. Solomon is wheeled away back to his room by a familiar looking nurse whom is.... Brenda Bates (Rebecca Gayheart). The wild-eyed killer from the first Urban Legend movie and the inspiration for this whole new film."

Grady Tripp is a professor/writer living in Pittsburgh who is struggling with writer's block. Whilst doing this, he also manages to get the chancellor pregnant.

This weekend proves even worse than he could imagine as he finds himself reeling from one misadventure to another in the company of a new wonder boy author.—yusufpiskin On the day his third wife leaves him and his literary agent arrives to pressure him to finish a novel seven years in the writing, Carnegie Mellon professor, Grady Tripp, also learns that his married mistress is pregnant. Seven years before, with his first novel, he was a wonder boy. So was his agent. Both now need something. Over the weekend, instead of making choices, he vacillates in a pot-induced haze. One of his students, James Leer, perhaps stirs paternal feelings in Grady and raises homo-erotic urges in the agent. Academic politics complicate things: Grady's mistress is the college chancellor, her husband chairs Grady's department, James has just shot the husband's dog. What to do?—<jhailey@hotmail.com> Professor Grady Tripp (Michael Douglas) is a novelist who teaches creative writing at an unnamed Pittsburgh university (the movie was shot chiefly in and around Carnegie Mellon University). He is having an affair with the university chancellor, Sara Gaskell (Frances McDormand), whose husband, Walter, is the chairman of the English department and thus Grady's boss. Grady's third wife, Emily, has just left him, and he has failed to repeat the grand success of his first novel, published years earlier. He continues to labor on a second novel, but the more he tries to finish it the less able he finds himself to invent a satisfactory ending - the book runs to over two and a half thousand pages and is still far from finished. He spends his free time smoking marijuana.His students include James Leer (Tobey Maguire) and Hannah Green (Katie Holmes). Hannah and James are friends and both very good writers. Hannah, who rents a room in Tripp's large house, is attracted to Tripp, but he does not reciprocate. James is enigmatic, quiet, dark and enjoys writing fiction more than he first lets on.During a party at the Gaskells' house, Sara reveals to Grady that she is pregnant with his child. Grady finds James standing outside holding what he claims to be a replica gun, won by his mother at a fairground during her schooldays. However, the gun turns out to be very real, as James shoots the Gaskells' dog when he finds it attacking Grady. James also steals a very valuable piece of Marilyn Monroe memorabilia from the house. Grady is unable to tell Sara of this incident as she is pressuring him to choose between her and Emily. As a result, Grady is forced to keep the dead dog in the trunk of his car for most of the weekend. He also allows James to follow him around, fearing that he may be depressed or even suicidal. Gradually he realizes that much of what James tells him about himself and his life is untrue, and is seemingly designed to elicit Grady's sympathy.Meanwhile, Grady's editor, Terry Crabtree (Robert Downey Jr.), has flown into town on the pretense of attending the university's annual WordFest, a literary event for aspiring authors. In reality, Crabtree is there to see if Tripp has written anything worth publishing, as both men's careers depend on Grady's upcoming book. Terry arrives with a transvestite whom he met on the flight, called Antonia Sloviak (Michael Cavadias). The pair apparently become intimate in a bedroom at the Gaskells' party, but immediately afterwards Terry meets, and becomes infatuated with, James Leer, and Sloviak is unceremoniously sent home. After a night on the town, Crabtree and James semi-consciously flirt throughout the night, which eventually leads up to the two end up spending an awkwardly intimate night together in one of Grady's spare rooms.Tired and confused, Grady phones Walter Gaskell (Richard Thomas) and reveals to him that he is in love with Walter's wife. Meanwhile, Walter has also made the connection between the disappearance of Marilyn Monroe's jacket and James Leer. The following morning the Pittsburgh Police arrive with Sara to escort James to the Chancellor's office to discuss the ramifications of his actions. The jacket is still in Grady's car, which has conspicuously gone missing. This car had been given to him by a friend as payment for a loan, and over the weekend Grady has come to suspect that the car was stolen. Over the course of his travel around town, Grady has been repeatedly accosted by a man claiming to be the car's real owner. He eventually tracks the car down, but in a dispute over its ownership the majority of his manuscript blows out of the car and is lost. The car's owner gives him a ride to the university with his wife, Oola, in the passenger seat, wearing the stolen jacket.Remembering James Leer's distress at how lonely the jacket looked in its own special closet, Grady finally sees that making things right involves having to make difficult choices. Grady tells Oola the story behind the jacket and allows her to leave with it. Worried that Grady's choice comes at the expense of damaging James Leer's future, Crabtree convinces Walter not to press charges by agreeing to publish his book, ""a critical exploration of the union of Joe DiMaggio and Marilyn Monroe and its function in American mythopoetics"", tentatively titled The Last American Marriage.The film ends with Grady recounting the eventual fate of the main characters - Hannah graduates and becomes a magazine editor; James wasn't expelled, but drops out anyway and moves to New York with Crabtree to rework his novel for publication; and Crabtree himself ""goes right on being Crabtree."" Grady finishes typing his new novel (now using a computer rather than a typewriter), then watches Sara and their child arriving home before turning back to the computer and clicking ""Save."""

The documentary jumps between the owners as they prepare to leave for the show, arriving at the hotel, and preparing backstage before their dog takes the show. The owners and their dogs include:Gerry and Cookie Fleck (Eugene Levy, Catherine O'Hara), with their Norwich Terrier Winky. They are a middle-class couple from Florida who run into monetary problems and are forced to sleep in the hotel's storage room when they finally arrive. Throughout the film, they encounter men that Cookie had slept with during her youth.Meg and Hamilton Swan (Parker Posey, Michael Hitchcock), with their Weimaraner Beatrice. An upper-class, stereotypical yuppie couple, they take great care in Beatrice (although really just confusing and aggravating her with their neurotic behavior), going as far as taking her to a therapist after she saw Meg and Hamilton have sex. At the show, the Swans believe that Beatrice will become unnerved without her favorite toy, the ""Busy Bee"", and frantically search for a replacement for it before the show.Harlan Pepper (Christopher Guest) and his Bloodhound Hubert. The Peppers have raised bloodhounds for generations, and Harlen continues the tradition, though he has aspirations of becoming a ventriloquist.Sherri Ann (Jennifer Coolidge) and Leslie Ward (Patrick Cranshaw) Cabot with their standard poodle Rhapsody in White (a.k.a. Butch), a two-time winner of the show in the past. Sherri Ann is a luscious big-breasted blonde, having the elderly Leslie as her sugar daddy. She is primarily worried about giving Rhapsody a makeover; however, trainer Christy Cummings (Jane Lynch) makes sure the dog is ready for the show, while Leslie stays utterly oblivious and apathetic. Over the course of the film, the fake couplehood between Sherri Ann and Leslie crumples while Sherri Ann's romantic involvement with Christy becomes apparent.Scott Donlan (John Michael Higgins) and Stefan Vanderhoof (Michael McKean) and their Shih Tzu. The gay couple takes great pride in their dog, and are confident that she will win the competition. They gossip about the other participants throughout the film.The owners and their dogs all arrive in time for the show, which is hosted by Trevor Beckwith (Jim Piddock), and ""color"" commentator Buck Laughlin (Fred Willard). During the first round, Beatrice is disqualified when Hamilton cannot control her, but the other four dogs advance to the final round. Just before the finals, Cookie stumbles and insists that Gerry take over for her. Though the audience is initially awed by seeing Gerry's ""two left feet"" (the result of a birth defect), ultimately Winky takes Best in Show.Afterwards, the film explores what each character is doing after the competition. Gerry and Cookie returned home to Florida and were overcome with attention after the victory. They go on to record, in amusingly bad style, songs about dogs. Sherri Ann and Christy have entered into a partnership and publish a magazine for lesbian dog owners called Modern Bitch. Harlan fulfills his dreams and becomes a ventriloquist, entertaining sparse crowds with a honky tonk song and dance number. Hamilton and Meg Swan have found a new dog, one that enjoys watching them make love, and are sure it will be a winner. Stefan and Scott are in the process of designing a calendar featuring Shih Tzu dogs appearing in scenes, with appropriate costume, from famous classic films, such as Gone with the Wind and Casablanca."

The brilliant Maureen seems poised for success, but she discovers that life is passing her by. Jody, whose body may be the wrong type and whose technique is ragged, elicits Cooper's interest. The edgy, smart-mouthed Eva loves to dance but seems destined to be stuck in the back of the chorus. The showcase will decide their fates.—<jhailey@hotmail.com> The film starts out with the audition of 18-year-old Jody Sawyer (Amanda Schull) for the American Ballet Academy, or ABA. She is cited as having bad feet and turnout, yet she makes it anyway.Upon arriving to the academy in New York City, she meets Cooper Neilson (Ethan Steifel), a famous ballet dancer returning to New York to teach at the academy. Once in her dorm room, Jody meets her two roommates, Eva Rodriguez (Zoë Saldana) and Maureen Cummings (Susan May Pratt). Eva and Jody immediately hit it off but Eva and Maureen have difficulty in getting along mostly because of their different backgrounds. Eva comes from a poor family in the Dominican Republic, while Maureen comes from a wealthy family in upstate New York which they both look down on each other with scorn. Jody and Eva leave to find a place where Eva can smoke and they run into Erik (Shakiem Evans), a gay dancer who introduces them to his friends.In Erik's room, Jody and Eva meet fellow dancers Sergi (IIia Kulik), a Russian ballet dancer who has been at the academy for many years, and Charlie (Sascha Radetsky), a newcomer who has instant chemistry with Jody.After a montage of breaking in point shoes, there is an introduction to the classes by the head of the company, Jonathan Reeves (Peter Gallagher) whom was a former ballet dancer himself over 20 years ago. During ballet practice, Jodi's bad turnout is noticed by one of the head teachers, Juliette Simone (Donna Murphy).As the girls pause in a doorway to watch the boys, famous ballet dancer Kathleen Donahue (Julie Kent) passes by and they take notice. After she is gone, Maureen tells them that Kathleen and Cooper broke up not too long ago when she left him to marry Jonathan. Since then Cooper had been in London and ""screwing everything in tights"".Maureen goes to meet her mother (Debra Monk), a former ballerina herself who works at ABA to discuss her possible rivals at getting into the American Ballet Company (ABC). It is clear that Maureen is under intense pressure from her pushy and domineering shrew of a mother to succeed in ballet and encourages her to ""do what it takes"" to succeed... even if the lines of ethics and morals are crossed on more than one occasion.There is a pas de deux class, where Charlie and Jody are partners.That night, the advanced students and teachers of ABA are at the ballet to see a show. First is a segment from Swan Lake, and then Romeo and Juliet danced by Cooper and Kathleen.After the show, the students have baskets of things to sell while a party goes on. People complement both Kathleen and Cooper on their ballet, and Cooper flirts with Jody. Jody and her friends sneak off and find a way on to the Lincoln Center stage. They mess around until Cooper and Kathleen bust into the auditorium. They hide while the adults fight. Cooper thinks they have obvious chemistry while Kathleen says it is just acting and she is happily married and she leaves in a huff.Outside, a young waiter named Jim (Eion Bailey) tries to get Maureen's name and phone number. Smitten and flattered by this nice guy's approach to her, she tells him where she lives at the ABA.A few days later, after another disastrous ballet class, Jody waits in Jonathan's office. He and Juliette tell her that they think ballet isn't the right path for her. Joey is visibly upset. Meanwhile, Jim meets Maureen outside ABA and asks her out on a date. She accepts. Jim introduces himself as a pre-med student at Columbia University and works part-time as a waiter to pay his bills.To ease Jody's stress, Eva decides that she and Charlie, Erik, and Sergi will take her out for a night on the town. They go to a salsa club where Jody and Charlie dance and flirt while Sergi gets hit on by an old barfly after he lies to her by pretending that he works for the Russian Mafia.Elsewhere that same evening, Jim and Maureen go out bowling with Jim's friends. Maureen doesn't know how to bowl (because all she's done is dance her whole life under pressure from her mother). Later, they sit around eating pizza and telling unfunny jokes. Maureen barely eats, but after Jim persuades her to eat something, she does eat a few slices of pizza. Later that night, Jim drops her off at her dorm where she goes inside and throws up in the bathroom.The next day, Jody, Eva, Charlie, Erik, and Sergi are clearly hung over and subsequently get kicked out of ballet class. Their punishment is to clean the mirrors in the studios, and during this they get in to a water fight, while Maureen looks on sadly at being left out of their close-knit group.Jody goes to take a dance class somewhere else in New York, because she is tired of taking criticism for her ballet dancing. During the Broadway dance class, Cooper comes in to assist/dance. After the class, Cooper convinces Jody to come back to his apartment for ""dessert"". They drink wine. They have sex.The next day, Jody thinks she and Cooper are dating after their one night stand and Kathleen makes fun of him.A few days later, Jonathan announces that the casting for the end of the year workshop is up. Charlie, Erik, and Jody are cast in a new ballet choreographed by Cooper. Maureen and Sergi are the leads in Jonathan's ballet, while Eva is in the corps. She is clearly upset at not getting any lead part.While they practice the ballets, we find out that Cooper's ballet is basically the story of him, Kathleen, and Jonathan. (It's REALLY obvious he's not even trying to hide it).A few days later, everyone, plus Jim and Maureen tagging along, go out to celebrate Erik's birthday. They drive around in a rented white-colored limo and go out on a ferry to the Statue of Liberty. Charlie asks Jody out and she says she's already seeing someone. Meanwhile, Jim finds Maureen vomiting in the ferry lavatory. She tells Jim that her throwing up is the result of sea sickness.The next day during dance rehearsal, Charlie figures out that it is Cooper whom Jody is ""seeing"". They have a ballet showdown of sorts, but Cooper wins. In Jonathan's ballet, Maureen is having trouble being passionate about the dance.Jody goes to the Lincoln Center to see Cooper (and Kathleen) perform George Balanchine's ""Stars and Stripes"". Kathleen knows exactly what's going on between him and Jody, but Cooper denies it. After the ballet, Jody waits for Cooper, but he leaves with another girl.The next day in rehearsal, everyone is sullen and Jody gets mad at Cooper for ""not being able to make up his mind"" in the dance, but she's really talking about their ""relationship"". Cooper tells her that he does not do relationships. Jody angrily storms out and Charlie goes after her. He convinces her to stay in the dance even though she is mad at Cooper.Another dancer, Emily (Victoria Born), having been hinted for being to fat to dance throughout the movie, packs up and leaves the school.That night, Jim and Maureen have a fight about her bulimia. Angry and frustrated about Jim telling her that she should get professional help for that her career in ballet is destroying her physical and mental health, Maureen breaks up with him and storms out of his apartment, telling him: ""I am the best goddamn dancer in the American Ballet Academy. Who the hell are you? Nobody!""A few days later, during rehearsal on stage, Erik suffers an injury, putting him out of the dance. Cooper thinks the understudy isn't good enough and wants to dance the part himself. Jonathan doesn't want him to, but Cooper threatens to pull the ballet.That evening, Maureen goes back to Jim's apartment and she apologizes for mouthing off to him and also tells him about Erik's injury and wishes that it could have been her. They both reconcile.A little later, after returning to the dorms, Maureen tells Jody and Eva that she's thinking about quitting the school because of her frustration at not doing anything else with her life. Both Jody and Eva tell Maureen how lucky she is for being talented and having a lead part in the upcoming ballet and that she should not give up a good thing going for her. Eva tells Maureen that despite their differences between them, she wishes they could trade places. Just when they are about to go to sleep for the night in their respective beds, Maureen asks Eva if they could talk.Performance Night.The first dance, the Italian Symphony, is lead by Anna (Megan Pepin), a girl who is a main contender for one of the spots in the company. The ballet number is a success.The next dance is Jonathan's. Sergi (as well as the theater audience) is surprised to discover Eva in Maureen's place as the lead. Meanwhile, Maureen and her mother have a confrontation in the lobby about Maureen quitting ballet. Maureen says that she is unhappy with her life and wants to leave the academy, while her mother tells her not to. Maureen walks away while her mother is angry still about her ""giving up her dream"". Maureen yells back at her mother saying that practicing ballet is HER dream, not Maureen's own.The last dance is Cooper's, which is incredibly elaborate and preposterous. It involves motorcycles, fake leather pants, ballet sex, two-second scene changes, red point shoes, and a lot of Jamiroquai. Jody, Cooper, and Charlie perform their well-choreographed moves which is clearly inspired by the Jody-Charlie-Cooper triangle.At the end, Jonathan announces who will make the American Ballet Company. Eva and Anna both do, as do Erik and Charlie. When Jody is called into Jonathan's office with an offer to join the company, she gives a speech and says she is joining Cooper's new company that he is now starting. Everyone congratulates each other outside in the lobby. Jim shows up to be with Maureen after she had told him earlier about quitting ballet. Jody tells Cooper that she is joining his new dance company, but she tells him: ""Cooper, you're a great choreographer and a talented dancer. But as a boyfriend... you kind of suck."" Joey then goes over to Charlie who congratulates her. Jody asks Charlie to the party that night and they kiss.During the end credits, there is a montage of the group at their current positions.Eva, the recovered Erik, and Charlie are dancing at ABC and practicing their ballet moves during a class.Sergi is seen dancing for a San Francisco ballet company with his girlfriend.Maureen is at college and talking with a group of new friends between classes, looking happy at leaving behind her dance life for good.Jody is dancing as a principal dancer at Cooper's company."

While the no-hope tunnellers get lost underground, the cookie operation really takes off and the team find themselves rich business people. But the other local money isn't quite ready to accept them.—Jeremy Perkins {J-26} New York City. Ray and Frances Winkler (the latter who goes by Frenchy, a former stage name) have been married for twenty-five years. Ray is a not too bright ex-con (bank robber) who has gone straight, going from one menial job to another. The one aspect of his former criminal life at which he was truly adept was cracking safes, something he taught Frenchy to do. Garish Frenchy, a former stripper, does nails, she managing to have saved $6,000 in the process. Despite being obsessed with the lifestyles of the rich and famous, Frenchy prefers this respectable life over the prospect of getting rich through larceny and in the process having to visit Ray in jail. That may all change when Ray wants to use that $6,000 as seed money (one-third stake) with his two even dimmer buddies, Denny Doyle and Tommy Walker, each putting in the same amount, for a bank heist. Ray's plan is for them to rent a recently vacated storefront two establishments down from a bank, tunnel underground to the bank and break into the vault, he guesstimating there probably a $2 million total take. They need Frenchy's support to do something with the storefront as a front, she deciding on a cookie shop as baking cookies is the one thing she knows how to do. As they work on the plan, they end up changing focus and bring in three other partners solely out of circumstance: Benny Bukowski, a former prison mate of Ray's whose specialty was insurance fraud (fires); May Sloane, Frenchy's even dimmer cousin, who takes statements at their literal meaning; and local cop Ken DeLoach, who has more a business sense than a cop sense. The refocused plan makes them rich beyond their wildest dreams. However, that wealth affects Ray and Frenchy in different ways, the latter who wants truly to be known as a cultured woman who not only is a benefactress to but a true connoisseur of anything associated with culture, such as the arts. That culture includes being known by her given name, Frances Fox. Meanwhile, Ray wants some semblance of their old life, such as eating Frenchy's specialty of linguine with turkey meatballs as opposed to anything with shaved truffles. This diversion in life goals may be a marriage breaker for Ray and Frenchy. As they proceed with their new nouveau riche lives, they may learn that crooks come in all sizes and shapes and are not confined to people solely from their old neighborhood.—Huggo Ray Winkler is a ""small time crook"" with big dreams.

As he begins to excel and develop a love for the hard sale and high commission, a few chance encounters lead Seth to question the legitimacy of the firm's operations - placing him once again at odds with his father and what remains of his morality.

He's terrific at sales. Once training is over, the pay is phenomenal, and Seth wonders why. Curiosity leads him to ethical dilemmas, encounters with the Feds, and new territory with his father.—<jhailey@hotmail.com> Seth Davis (Giovanni Ribisi) is a 19-year-old dropout from Queens College who runs an unlicensed casino in his apartment. Although he earns a successful living in his line of work, he is constantly berated by his father, Marty (Ron Rifkin), a New York City federal judge. One night, his old friend Adam (Jamie Kennedy) stops by the casino to play blackjack, bringing a wealthy associate named Greg Weinstein (Nicky Katt) along with him. Although Seth is content with his earnings through the casino, he becomes increasingly unnerved due to Marty's disapproval and the risk factor of having his business shut down along with his arrest. On another night, Greg recruits Seth to join J.T. Marlin, a brokerage firm based somewhere off the Long Island Expressway, ""a good hour away from Wall Street"" as Seth describes it. He is impressed with not only the chance to earn a legal living, but to make millions of dollars.Arriving at J.T. Marlin, Seth attends a group interview and learns from Jim Young (Ben Affleck), one of the co-founders of the firm, what is expected of his work and also how he can become a millionaire. The firm's techniques of selling are through cold calling investors to sell stock, and Seth joins as a stockbroker trainee, having to close 40 accounts and pass a Series 7 Exam in order to begin working independently. He finds success in his new job as he proceeds to do very well in his work, as well as impressing his parents, becoming part of a crowd of successful senior brokers, and embarking on a romance with Abbie Halpert (Nia Long), a secretary and ex-girlfriend of Greg. Seth also experiences trials and tribulations, including altercations and arguments he experiences with Greg and the decision to close down his casino.On the other hand, J.T. Marlin has been under investigation by the FBI, revealing the firm's illegitimacy. The company is a chop stock brokerage firm that runs a ""pump and dump"", using its brokers to create artificial demand in the stock of expired or fake companies. When the firm is done pumping the stock, the investors then have no one to sell their shares to in the market, and the price of the stock plummets. The federal agents decide to pursue Seth, figuring he is a good target due to his intelligence, and his potential of not being too loyal to the firm due to his short tenure.Seth passes his Series 7 Exam and becomes a senior broker. He then contacts Harry Reynard (Taylor Nichols), the purchasing manager of a gourmet foods company, different and less privileged than the other ""whales"" who are common prey for the firm. Although Harry emphasizes that he and his family are being frugal at the moment in order to buy a house, Seth falsely promises a good investment for him that can very well turn out to be highly profitable. After selling him 100 shares at $8. each, Harry calls back to ask why the stock has done so poorly. Seth sells him even more worthless shares, persuading him the outcome will not be consequential. This creates an excruciating financial situation for Harry and his family, causing him to lose the house he had wanted to purchase as well as being abandoned by his family.Unnerved by the decision to scam Harry, Seth comes to terms with knowing that J.T. Marlin isn't as legitimate as it was made out to be before. Marty then disowns him, blasting him for his dishonest work of stealing and destroying other peoples' lives. Despite this, Seth shows up at his father's office and emotionally explains that he shut down his casino and went along with a highly criminal line of work that he thought was legal in order to gain his family's approval. He then requests that his father helps him on an IPO scheme in order to rob the firm of their money and bring them down. Although Marty initially refuses due to the risk of losing his judgeship, he calls Seth the next day, reconciling with him and offering an involvement in the scheme.Seth is eventually arrested by the FBI for the violation of 26 SEC and NASD regulations, and is brought into their custody along with his father, as the bureau had discovered their IPO scheme due to a tape-recorded phone conversation. The FBI offer him federal immunity if he agrees to testify against J.T. Marlin once all the suspects are brought into court, but can also involve Marty due to evidence of their intentions for an illegal activity. Seth asserts that he will testify against the firm and provide strong evidence of their illegal practices only if his father is released. He and the agents come to an agreement on this, with Seth being kept overnight only to return to work the next day and make copies of investment files onto a floppy disk in order to use as evidence. After that, it is implied that he will be free to go as the FBI will proceed to raid the building and prosecute everybody else.Seth returns to work the next day and goes along with the FBI's instruction. Before leaving, Seth attempts to redeem himself for his actions and attempts to get Harry's money back. He lies to Michael Brantley (Tom Everett Scott), the company founder, by explaining that the firm can lose a lot of money by refusing to continue to do business with Harry Reynard, who Seth makes out to be an important and profitable prospect at a make-or-break turning point. Brantley agrees to proceed based on Seth's explanation, offering him shares of the next IPO, however, with a caveat that he cannot sell the shares until the firm has sold off their shares. In order to sell the shares behind Michael's back, Seth needs a ticket sale signed by a senior broker, something that his direct supervisor, Greg, has explicitly said that he would never do.Seth seeks a signing from Chris Varick (Vin Diesel), explaining that he may well ""do one thing right"" in helping a severely hit investor make his money back, now that the firm will be raided and, soon enough, there will be no future in continuing business at J.T. Marlin. Chris reluctantly agrees to do so, and proceeds to escape the building in an attempt to flee federal enforcement. Seth walks out to his car, deciding what to do with his life now that his ties with J.T. Marlin are finished.

Meanwhile at the Council of Mages, Profion, threatened by Empress Savina's desire to give rights to the common people, convinces the council that her power must be usurped.When a creature of Priofion's overhears Savina's plan to get rid of his influence, Profion sends Damodar to kill the magic school's library wizard to get the map to the Rod of Savrille, a rod that allows the wielder to control Red dragons. Meanwhile, Ridley and Snails break into the school in an attempt to rob it.While making their way through the school, Ridley and Snails are caught by Marina, a young mage and apprentice to Vildan, the school's library wizard. Hearing a commotion, Marina rushes off, dragging the boys along with her due to a spell she cast on them, to find Damodar interrogating Vildan. Vildan throws Marina a map before Damodar kills him. In the ensuing chase, the trio come across a dwarf named Elwood, who joins them as they escape into the sewers of the city. After escaping, the party are framed for the murder of Vildan. With a reward out for their capture, they plan to leave the city.Back in Profion's chambers, he infects Damodar with worm-like creatures for his failure, stating that he will remove them if he captures the party and brings them back to him. Profion then suggests that Damodar follow Norda, the Empress' best tracker, who is on the hunt for the party.While studying it in a tavern, Ridley and Marina are transported into the map where they speak to a Wraith who gives them a map to a dragon temple, where the rod is. However, in order to get into the temple they must first infiltrate the thieves guild in Antius to obtain a ruby called the Eye of the Dragon.Meanwhile, Snails and Elwood are chased out of the tavern after running into Damodar and his men, with Norda in pursuit. After escaping the map, Ridley and Marina advise the group what they must do. Snails wants no part in it, but Ridley tells Snails that they plan to get the ruby and then split.The party arrives in Antius and locates the thieves guild after stalking a member through the market. After being captured by the guild members, they are taken to their leader, Xilus, who tells them that in order to obtain the Eye of the Dragon they must make their way to the center of the guild's deadly maze. Entering the maze alone, Ridley manages to make his way to the center to obtain the Eye of the Dragon. Xilus soon demands Ridley hand the ruby over, citing he's waited 15 years for someone to obtain it for him. Suddenly Damodar arrives at the guild where he captures Marina and the map.Norda locates the remaining members of the group. After she reports to the Empress that Damodar has already taken Marina and the map, the Empress commands Norda to confront Damodar and retrieve Marina and the map. Elsewhere, Damodar pleads with Marina to help him obtain the rod. When she refuses he tortures her to learn that the group has the Eye of the Dragon, and that it is needed to obtain the rod.Ridley and Snails stage a rescue by infiltrating Damodar's camp while Norda and Elwood remain outside. While attempting to steal the map from his chambers, Snails is chased by Damodar. Ridley rescues Marina and gets the map back, but is unable to save Snails as Damodar kills him. Ridley charges, only to be stabbed by his own sword before Marina, picking up a bag of magical dust, casts a spell that subdues Damodar and escapes with Ridley.Back at the Council of Mages, the Empress and Profion are publicly debating in front of the Council whether or not the Empress should give up her Gold scepter to Profion or not. The Empress stands her ground, claiming she will not give up the scepter to Profion, believing he will only use it for his own gain, before storming out. Profion calls for war against the Empress, to the cheers of the council.Meanwhile, the party travels to an elf village, where a healer elf heals Ridley of his wounds. The king warns that if dragons are destroyed, then the balance of magic will go along with it. That night, Marina offers her condolences to Ridley, but he dismisses her because she cannot understand what it's like to be a commoner like him and that he no longer wishes to fight in this war. Marina tells him that the Empress wishes to make all commoners and Mages equal. Ridley then kisses her as a tiny demon watches them in the distance. The party leaves the village and makes their way to the dungeon that holds the Rod of Savrille. Ridley is the first to enter the dungeon, but the others cannot follow due to a magical force field blocking them.Ridley carries onward through the dungeon until he happens across a statue made to look like a red dragon. After placing the Eye of the Dragon into an empty eye socket on the statue, a doorway opens to reveal a room of treasures. Ridley ignores the contents of the room and approaches a skeleton hanging on a hook, the rod in its hand. The skeleton comes alive, stating it is Savrille waiting for a worthy person to come and take the rod from him. Ridley takes the rod but not before Savrille warns him that ""Whoever wields the rod will suffer a horrible fate, for the evil it creates cannot be undone until the spell is broken.""Outside the council, the Empress uses her rod to call for the Golden dragons to attack. With Profion leading them, the council counter attacks, having little effect on the creatures. The Empress, regretting her attack, calls the dragons to retreat.Exiting the dungeon, Ridley finds that the party has been captured by Damodar and his men. Ridley gives the rod to Damodar in exchange for the party's life, but Damodar orders his men to kill them anyways. The group manages to fend off Damodar's men, but not before Damodar opens a portal that will bring him to Profion. Ridley follows Damodar through the portal.Damodar gives the rod to Profion, who in turn removes the worm-like creatures from his head. The empress stages another attack while Profion summons the Red dragons. Meanwhile, Ridley kills Damodar then attacks Profion. Ridley is no match for Profion, until the group shows up, effectively getting the Rod away from him long enough for Ridley to get it back. Marina encourages Ridley to use the Rod to bring Profion down, but Ridley, realizing the Rod's power will corrupt him, refuses and destroys it. The Empress appears to confront Profion, who almost overtakes her, until she has a Golden dragon eat him.In the aftermath of battle, the Empress declares that everyone in the kingdom is now equal. On the day of Ridley's knighting ceremony, he along with Marina, Elwood, and Norda, visit Snails' grave. After saying his goodbyes, Ridley places the Eye of the Dragon on the grave. As he does, Snails' name disappears from the grave and the Eye glows bright. Taking the Eye in their hands, the group are transported to go meet Snails."
American Psycho,2000,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0144084/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A wealthy New York City investment banking executive, Patrick Bateman, hides his alternate psychopathic ego from his co-workers and friends as he delves deeper into his violent, hedonistic fantasies. It's the late 1980s. Twenty-seven year old Wall Streeter Patrick Bateman travels among a closed network of the proverbial beautiful people, that closed network in only they able to allow others like themselves in in a feeling of superiority. Patrick has a routinized morning regimen to maintain his appearance of attractiveness and fitness. He, like those in his network, are vain, narcissistic, egomaniacal and competitive, always having to one up everyone else in that presentation of oneself, but he, unlike the others, realizes that, for himself, all of these are masks to hide what is truly underneath, someone/something inhuman in nature. In other words, he is comprised of a shell resembling a human that contains only greed and disgust, greed in wanting what others may have, and disgust for those who do not meet his expectations and for himself in not being the first or the best. That disgust ends up manifesting itself in wanting to rid the world of those people, he not seeing them as people but only of those characteristics he wants to rid.—Huggo Patrick Bateman is handsome, well educated and intelligent. He is twenty-seven and living his own American dream. He works by day on Wall Street, earning a fortune to complement the one he was born with. At night he descends into madness, as he experiments with fear and violence.—Lion Films A white background. Red drops begin to fall past the opening credits. The drops become a red sauce on a plate. A slab of meat is cut with a knife and garnished with raspberries, then placed on a table. The camera moves over various dishes, most of which are very small and look very expensive. The restaurant is furnished in pinks and greens, and everyone is well-dressed. Waiters tell customers ridiculously decadent specials like squid ravioli and swordfish meatloaf.The setting is New York City, sometime in the 1980s. The vice-presidents of Pierce and Pierce, a Wall Street financial institution, are seated around a table. They include Timothy Bryce (Justin Theroux), Craig McDermott (Josh Lucas), David Van Paten (Bill Sage) and Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale). Bryce says ""This is a chick's restaurant. Why aren't we at Dorsia?"" McDermott replies ""Because Bateman won't give the maitre d' head."" Bateman flicks a toothpick at him. They discuss various people in the restaurant, including who Bateman believes to be Paul Allen across the room. Van Paten returns from the bathroom and says that there's no good place to do coke in. They discuss the fact that Allen is handling the Fisher account, which leads McDermott to make racist remarks about Allen being Jewish. ""Jesus, McDermott, what does that have to do with anything?"" says Patrick. ""I've seen that bastard sitting in his office spinning a fucking menorah."" Bateman rebukes him. ""Not a menorah. A dreidel, you spin a dreidel."" McDermott replies ""Do you want me to fry you up some potato pancakes? Some latkes?"" ""No, just cool it with the anti-Semitic remarks."" ""Oh I forgot. Bateman's dating someone from the ACLU!"" Bryce calls Bateman the voice of reason. Looking at the check he remarks ""Speaking of reasonable, only $570."" They all drop their Platinum American Express cards on top of the bill.At a nightclub, Bryce takes some money out of a clip and gives it to a man in drag, who lets them inside. As some 80's pop music plays from overhead, the men dance while strobe lights flash and some women on stage wave around prop guns like something out of a grind house flick. Bateman orders a drink and hands the bartender a drink ticket, but she tells him drink tickets are no good and that he has to pay in cash. He pays, and then when she's out of earshot, he says ""You're a fucking ugly bitch. I want to stab you to death, then play around with your blood."" He takes his drink with a smile.The camera pans through Bateman's apartment the next morning. Everything is shades of white, with black counters and shelves. It is sparsely decorated, but looks expensive. ""I live in the American Gardens building on West 81st street, on the 11th floor. My name is Patrick Bateman. I'm 27 years old."" He describes his diet and exercise routine, and his meticulous daily grooming rituals, which involves no less than 9 different lotions and cleansers. ""There is an idea of a Patrick Bateman,"" he says while peeling off his herb-mint facial mask. ""Some kind of abstraction. But there is no 'real me'. Only an entity. Something illusory. And though I can hide my cold gaze, and you can shake my hand and feel flesh gripping yours, and maybe you can even sense our lifestyles are probably comparable, I simply am not there.""Sweeping over the skyline of downtown New York, the song Walking on Sunshine starts playing. Walking down the hallway to his office, Bateman listens to this song on his headphones with absolutely no expression on his face. Someone passes by him and says ""Hey Hamilton. Nice tan."" Everyone in the hallway has expensive suits and slicked-back hair. He walks by his secretary, Jean (Chloe Sevigny), to his office door. She's dressed in a long coat and shirt that are too big for her. ""Aerobics class, sorry. Any messages?"" She follows him into his corner office. She tells him someone cancelled, but she doesn't know what he cancelled or why. ""I occasionally box with him at the Harvard Club."" She tells him someone named Spencer wants to meet for drinks. He tells her to cancel it. ""What should I say?"" ""Just say no."" He tells her to make reservations for him at a restaurant for lunch, as well as dinner reservations at Arcadia on Thursday. ""Something romantic?"" ""No, silly. Forget it. I'll make them. Just get me a mineral water."" She tells him he looks nice. Without looking at her, he tells her not to wear that outfit. ""Wear a dress or a skirt. You're prettier than that."" The phone starts ringing, and he tells her to tell anyone who calls that he isn't there. ""And high heels."" She leaves. He puts his feet up and starts watching Jeopardy on his office TV.A taxicab makes its way through Chinatown. Inside, Bateman is trying to listen to the new Robert Palmer album on his headphones, but his ""supposed"" fiancée Evelyn (Reese Witherspoon) keeps distracting him with ideas for their wedding. He says he can't take the time off work to get married. ""Your father practically owns the company. You can do anything you like, silly. You hate that job anyway, I don't see why you don't just quit."" ""Because... I want... to fit... IN."" The cab drives up to a restaurant called Espace. ""I'm on the verge of tears as we arrive, since I'm positive we won't have a decent table. But we do, and relief washes over me, in an awesome wave."" Bryce it already seated next to two punk-rock teens smoking cigarettes. ""This is my cousin Vanden and her boyfriend Stash,"" says Evelyn. Bryce kisses Evelyn on both cheeks, and then starts kissing her neck, slightly crossing the line. Bateman looks at his blurry reflection in a metal menu. As they eat sushi, he remarks ""I'm fairly certain that Timothy Bryce and Evelyn are having an affair. Timothy is the only interesting person I know."" Bateman doesn't care because he's also having an affair with Courtney Rawlinson, her best friend. ""She's usually operating on one or more psychiatric drugs, tonight I believe it's Xanax."" She's also engaged to Luis Carruthers, ""the biggest doofus in the business."" Courtney and Luis are seated beside him, and Courtney, slurring her words, asks Stash whether he thinks Soho is becoming too commercial. ""Yes. I read that,"" says Luis. ""Oh who gives a rat's ass,"" says Bryce. ""That affects us,"" says Vanden. ""What about the massacres in Sri Lanka, honey? Don't you know that the Sikhs are killing like, tons of Israelis over there?"" Bateman tells him there are more important problems to worry about than Sri Lanka. He tells them they include Apartheid, nuclear arms, terrorism, and world hunger. ""We have to provide food and shelter for the homeless, and oppose racial discrimination and promote civil rights, while also promoting equal right for women. We have to encourage a return to traditional moral values. Most importantly, we have to promote general social concern, and less materialism in young people."" Bryce almost chokes on his drink as he starts laughing. ""Patrick, how thought-provoking,"" Luis says, feigning tears. Patrick takes a swig of his whiskey.It's nighttime. Patrick takes some money out of an ATM. A woman walks by and he starts following her. They stop at a crosswalk and he says ""hello"". She hesitantly says hello back. The sign changes to walk and they cross the street.The next day, Bateman argues with an old Chinese woman who runs a dry cleaners. Another Chinese man is looking at some bed sheets with a huge red stain on them. Bateman is trying to tell her that you can't bleach that type of sheet, and that they are very expensive. She continues to babble in a language he can't understand. ""Lady, if you don't shut your fucking mouth, I will kill you."" She is shocked, but still won't speak English. ""I can't understand you! You're a fool! Stupid bitch-ee!"" A woman comes in the door and recognizes him. Her name is Victoria. He says hi to her. ""It's so silly to come all the way up here,"" she says, ""but they really are the best."" ""Then why can't they get these stains out?"" he says, showing her the sheets. ""Can you get through to them? I'm getting nowhere."" ""What are those?"" she says, looking wide-eyed at the stains. ""Uh, well it's cranberry juice. Cran-apple."" She looks skeptical. He tells her he has a lunch date in 15 minutes, and she tries to make plans with him. He tells her he's booked solid. ""What about Saturday?"" ""Next Saturday? Can't. Matinee of Les Mis."" He promises to call her, and then leaves.Patrick paces his apartment in his underwear, on the phone with Courtney Rawlinson (Samantha Mathis). A porno movie is playing on his TV. ""You're dating Luis, he's in Arizona. You're fucking me and we haven't made plans. What could you possibly be up to tonight?"" She says she's waiting for Luis to call. ""Pumpkin you're dating an asshole. Pumpkin you're dating the biggest dickweed in New York. Pumpkin you're dating a tumbling, tumbling dickweed."" She tells him to stop calling her pumpkin. He insists that they have dinner, and when she says no, he says he can get them a table at Dorsia. This perks her interest. He tells her to wear something nice. He calls the restaurant, and asks if he can make a reservation for two at 8:00 or 8:30. There is a moment of silence on the other end of the phone, then the man on the other end starts laughing uncontrollably. Patrick hangs up.In a limo, Patrick listens to Courtney describe her day, while she is almost passing out from her medication. ""Is that Donald Trump's car?"" he asks, looking out the window. Patrick's face is blurred through the plastic divider of the limo. She tells him to shut up. He tells her to take some more lithium, or coke or caffeine to get her out of her slump. ""I just want a child,"" she says, absently looking out the window. ""Just two... perfect... children.""At the restaurant, she nearly falls asleep at the table and Patrick touches her shoulder and wakes her up. ""Are we here?"" she asks sleepily. ""Yeah,"" he says, sitting down. ""This is Dorsia?"" ""Yes dear,"" he says, opening the menu which clearly says Barcadia across it. He tells her she's going to have the peanut butter soup with smoked duck and mashed squash. ""New York Matinee called it a 'playful but mysterious little dish. You'll love it."" He orders her the red snapper with violets and pine nuts to follow. She thanks him, and then passes out in her chair.A conference table at P&P the next day. Luis thanks Patrick for looking after Courtney. ""Dorsia, how impressive. How on Earth did you get a reservation there?"" ""Lucky I guess,"" replies Patrick. Luis compliments him on his suit. ""Valentino Couture?"" ""Uh-huh."" Luis tries to touch it, but Patrick slaps his hand away. ""Your compliment was sufficient Luis."" Paul Allen comes up to them. ""Hello Halberstram. Nice tie. How the hell are ya?"" Narrating, Patrick explains that Allen has mistaken him for ""this dickhead Marcus Halberstram."" They both work at P&P and do the same exact work, and wear the same glasses and suits. ""Marcus and I even go to the same barber. Although I have a slightly better haircut."" Allen and Patrick discuss accounts. He asks him about Cecilia, Marcus' girlfriend. ""She's great, I'm very lucky,"" replies Patrick. Bryce and McDermott come in, congratulating Allen on the Fisher account. ""Thank you, Baxter."" Bryce asks him if he wants to play squash. Allen gives him his card out of his case. An audible tremor goes through the room. ""Call me."" ""How about Friday?"" says Bryce. ""No can do. I got an 8:30 rez at Dorsia. Great sea urchin seviche."" He leaves. Bryce wonders how he managed to swing that. McDermott thinks he's lying. Bateman takes out his new business card, which reads ""Patrick BATEMAN - Vice President"". ""What do you think?"" ""Very nice,"" says McDermott. ""I picked them up from the printers yesterday."" ""Nice coloring,"" says Bryce. ""That's 'bone'. And the lettering is something called 'silian rail'."" ""Cool Bateman. But that's nothing,"" says Van Paten, laying his card down next to Patrick's. ""That is really nice,"" says Bryce. ""Eggshell with romalian type. What do you think?"" Van Paten asks Patrick. ""Nice,"" Patrick says, visibly jealous. ""How did a nitwit like you get so tasteful?"" says Bryce. Biting his nails, Patrick can't believe Bryce prefers Van Paten's card. ""You ain't seen nothing yet,"" says Bryce, taking out his own card. ""Raised lettering, pale nimbus, white."" Another tremor goes through the room. Holding back his rage, Bateman tells him it's very nice. ""Let's see Paul Allen's card."" Bryce takes it out of his pocket and hands it to Bateman. It shines with an ethereal glow in the dim light of the conference room, even though it is basically identical to the rest of their cards. Narrating, Patrick says ""Look at the subtle off-white coloring. The tasteful thickness of it. Oh my God. It even has a watermark!"" He drops the card on the table. ""Something wrong?"" asks Luis. ""Patrick? You're sweating.""Nighttime. Patrick walks by a courthouse on his way home. Steam rises from underground vents. He walks through an alley, a black shadow under a pale streetlight. He stops and looks behind him, to see a homeless man by some piles of trash. ""Hello. Pat Bateman. Do you want some money? Some food?"" He starts taking out some money. ""I'm hungry,"" says the bum. ""It's cold out too isn't it? If you're so hungry, why don't you get a job?"" The bum says he lost his job. ""Why? Were you drinking? Insider trading? Just joking."" He asks him his name, and the bum says his name is Al. ""Get a god-damn job, Al! You have a negative attitude. That's what's stopping you."" He promises to help him get his act together. Al tells him he's a kind man. He puts his hand on Patrick's arm, and Patrick pulls it off, visibly disgusted. ""You know how bad you smell? You reek of shit. You know that?"" He laughs, and then apologizes. ""I don't have anything in common with you."" He bends down and opens his briefcase. ""Oh thank you mister, thank you. It's cold out here..."" ""You know what a fucking loser you are?"" Patrick suddenly takes a knife out of the briefcase and stabs the bum three times in the stomach, than pushes the shocked man to the ground. The dog barks at Patrick, so he stomps it with his foot, hard enough to kill it. He picks up his briefcase and walks away down the alley.A health spa. A young Asian woman rubs some lotion on Patrick's face. She compliments him on his smooth skin. Later, another Asian woman gives him a manicure. ""I have all the characteristics of a human being. Flesh. Blood. Skin. Hair. But not a single, clear, identifiable emotion, except for greed, and disgust. Something horrible is happening inside me, and I don't know why."" He is lying in a tanning bed now. ""My nightly bloodlust has overflowed into my days. I feel lethal, on the verge of frenzy. I think my mask of sanity is about to slip.""A Christmas party. A short man in an elf costume hands out glasses of champagne. 'Deck The Halls' is playing in the background. Patrick takes one, scowling at the bizarre costumes. Someone comes up to him and calls him by the wrong name. ""Hey Hamilton. Have a holly-jolly Christmas,"" says Patrick. ""Is Allen still handling the Fisher account?"" He points to Paul Allen across the room. ""Of course. Who else?"" Evelyn comes up to them. ""Mistletoe alert! Merry X-mas Patrick. You're late honey."" ""I've been here the entire time, you just didn't see me."" A man behind him puts cloth antlers on Patrick's head without him noticing. ""Say hello to Snowball. Snowball says 'hello Patrick'"", she says in a childish voice. ""What is it?"" Patrick looks with disgust at the creature in her arms. ""It's a little baby piggy-wiggy, isn't it? It's a Vietnamese potbellied pig. They make darling pets. Don't you? Don't you?"" Patrick looks ready to vomit as she pets the animal. ""Stop scowling Patrick. You're such a Grinch. What does Mr. Grinch want for Christmas? And don't say breast implants again."" Ignoring her, he goes to mingle with the rest of the party. 'Joy to the World' is playing. He says hi to Paul Allen. ""Hey Marcus. Merry Christmas, how've you been. Workaholic I suppose?"" He calls to Hamilton that they are going to Nell's bar, and that the limo is out front. Patrick says that they should have dinner. Paul suggests that he bring Cecilia. ""Cecilia would adore it."" ""Then let's do it, Marcus."" Evelyn comes up to them. Paul compliments her on the party, and then walks away. ""Why is he calling you Marcus?"" asks Evelyn. Ignoring this, Patrick says ""Mistletoe alert!"", and kisses her while waving a leafy branch.A restaurant. Most of the tables are empty. Patrick takes his reservation under the name Marcus Halberstram. He is led to a table where Paul is already seated, and he is arguing with a waiter. ""I ordered the cilantro crawfish gumbo, which is of course the only excuse one could have for being at this restaurant, which is, by the way, almost completely empty."" Patrick ignores this and orders a J&B straight and a Corona. The waiter, who looks slightly effeminate and has a red bandana around his neck, starts to list the specials, but Paul cuts him off and orders a double Absolut martini. ""Yes sir. Would you like to hear the specials?"" ""Not if you want to keep your spleen,"" says Patrick. The waiter leaves. ""This is a real beehive of activity Halberstram. This place is hot, very hot,"" Paul comments sarcastically. ""The mud soup and charcoal arugula are outrageous here,"" replies Patrick. Paul derides him for being late. ""I'm a child of divorce, give me a break. I see they've omitted the pork loin with lime Jell-o."" Paul says he could have gotten them a table at Dorsia instead. ""Nobody goes there anymore. Is that Ivana Trump?"" Patrick says, looking behind him. ""Oh geez Patrick. I mean Marcus. What are you thinking? Why would Ivana be at Texarkana?"" He asks how Paul ended up getting the Fisher account. ""Well I could tell you that Halberstram... but then I'd have to kill ya!"" He laughs. Patrick simply stares at him with a vicious smile.They pick at their meals. Patrick says ""I like to dissect girls. Did you know I'm utterly insane?"" Paul doesn't seem to hear him. He compliments him on his tan. When Patrick says he goes to a salon, Paul says he has a tanning bed at home. ""You should look into it."" Patrick can barely suppress his rage. Paul asks about Cecilia. ""I think she's having dinner with Evelyn Williams."" ""Evelyn! Great ass. She goes out with that loser Patrick Bateman, what a dork!"" Patrick chuckles with inner contempt. ""Another martini Paul?""Patrick's apartment. Paul lounges drunk on a chair with a bottle of liquor on the floor beside him. Newspapers are taped to the floor of the living room. Patrick picks up a CD. ""Do you like Huey Lewis and the News?"" ""They're OK,"" says Paul. Patrick continues ""Their early work was a little too new wave for my tastes, but when 'Sports' came out in '83, I think they really came into their own. Commercially and artistically."" He goes to the bathroom and puts on a raincoat. ""The whole album has a clear crisp sound, and a new sheen of consummate professionalism, that really gives the songs a big boost!"" He takes a valium, washes it down, looks at himself in the mirror, and walks back into the living room. On his way back he grabs an axe. Moonwalking backwards, he says that Huey has been compared to Elvis Costello, but that Huey has a more cynical sense of humor. He puts the axe down and starts buttoning up the raincoat behind Paul. ""Hey Halberstram,"" says Paul. ""Why are there copies of the Style section all over the floor? Do you have a dog? A little chow or something?"" He laughs. ""No Allen."" ""Is that a raincoat?"" ""Yes it is!"" He goes over to the CD player and presses a button. The song 'Hip to Be Square' starts playing. ""In '87, Huey released this, Fore, their most accomplished album. I think their undisputed masterpiece is 'Hip to Be Square'."" He dances over to the kitchen where he left the axe. ""The song is so catchy, most people probably don't listen to the lyrics, but they should, because it's not just about the pleasures of conformity and the importance of trends, it's also a personal statement about the band itself! Hey Paul!"" Paul looks around too late to see Patrick charge at him with the axe. Screaming, he swings it into Paul's head splattering blood all over his own face. Paul falls to the floor, pouring blood all over the newspapers. Patrick yells ""Try getting a reservation at Dorsia now you fucking stupid bastard!"" He swings it down again, and again, screaming, decapitating him. ""You... fucking... bastard!"" He finally drops the axe and begins composing himself. He takes off the raincoat. He fixes his hair and lights up a cigar. 'Hip to Be Square' continues to play from the stereo.Patrick drags the body through the lobby of his building in a black bag. A trail of blood pours from the bottom of the bag. The doorman looks up at him, and then goes back to writing something. Patrick hails a cab outside, and starts stuffing the bag into the trunk. A voice says his name from the sidewalk. It's Luis. ""Patrick. Is that you?"" ""No Luis. It's not me. You're mistaken."" He introduces Patrick to an attractive Asian woman. ""We're going to Nell's. Gwendolyn's father is buying it. Ooh. Where did you get that overnight bag?"" He eyes the bag with the corpse inside it. ""Jean-Paul Gaultier."" Patrick slams the trunk and heads off.Later, he arrives at Paul's apartment. ""I almost panic when I realize that Paul's place overlooks the park, and is obviously more expensive than mine."" He finds his suitcases and starts to pack. ""It's time for Paul to take a little trip."" He throws some clothes in a suitcase, and then goes to the answering machine. In his best imitation of Paul's voice, he records ""It's Paul. I've been called away to London for a few days. Meredith, I'll call you when I get back. Hasta la vista, baby."" He takes the suitcase and leaves.In his office the next day, Patrick listens to the song 'The Lady in Red' by Chris De Burgh on his headphones. Jean comes in and tells him that there's someone named Donald Kimball there to see him. ""Who?"" ""Detective Donald Kimball."" He looks through the office window. ""Tell him I'm at lunch."" ""Patrick, it's only 10:30. I think he knows you're here."" ""Send him in, I guess,"" he says resignedly. Jean goes to get him. Patrick picks up the phone and starts having a pretend conversation with someone, giving him advice on clothes and salons. ""Always tip the stylist fifteen percent. Listen John I've gotta go. T. Boone Pickens just walked in. Heh, just joking. No, don't tip the owner of the salon. Right. Got it."" He hangs up and apologizes to Kimball. ""No I'm sorry, I should have made an appointment. Was that anything important?"" Patrick gives a vague synopsis of the call. ""Mulling over business problems, examining opportunities, exchanging rumors, spreading gossip."" They introduce themselves to each other and shake hands. Kimball apologizes again for barging in. Patrick stuffs some magazines and his walkman into a desk drawer. ""So, what's the topic of discussion?"" Kimball explains that Meredith hired him to investigate the disappearance of Paul Allen. ""I just have some basic questions."" Patrick offers him coffee, which he turns down. He offers him a bottle of water, which he also turns down. Bateman presses the intercom button anyways and tells Jean to bring some water. ""It's no problem."" He asks what the topic of discussion is again, and Kimball repeats he's investigating the disappearance of Paul Allen. Jean comes in with a bottle, and Patrick quickly puts a coaster down before she can put it on the desk. He tells Kimball he hasn't heard anything. ""I think his family wants this kept quiet."" ""Understandable. Lime?"" offers Bateman. Kimball insists he's ok. He asks Patrick his age, where he went to school, and his address, the American Gardens building, which Kimball says is very nice. ""Thanks,"" Patrick says smugly. Kimball asks what he knew about Paul Allen. ""I'm at a loss. He was part of that whole Yale thing."" Kimball asks him what he means. ""Well I think for one that he was probably a closet homosexual who did a lot of cocaine. That Yale thing."" Kimball asks what kind of person Paul was. ""I hope I'm not being cross-examined here."" ""You feel like that?"" ""No. Not really."" Kimball asks where Paul hung out. Patrick names some places including a yacht club. ""He had a yacht?"" ""No, he just hung out there."" ""And where did he go to school?"" ""Don't you know this?"" ""I just wanted to know if you know."" Patrick tells him St. Paul's, then says he just wants to help. ""I understand."" Patrick asks if he has any witnesses or fingerprints. Kimball tells him about the message on the answering machine, and that Meredith doesn't think he went to London. ""Has anyone seen him in London?"" ""Actually, yes. But I'm having a hard time getting actual verification."" He tells him that someone thought they saw Paul there but mistook someone else for him. Patrick asks whether the apartment had been burglarized. Kimball tells him about the missing luggage. Patrick asks whether the police had become involved yet, but Kimball says no. ""Basically, no-one's seen or heard anything. It's just strange. One day someone's walking around, going to work, alive, and then..."" ""Nothing."" ""People just disappear,"" says Kimball with a sigh. Bateman says ""The earth just... opens up and swallows them."" ""Eerie. Really eerie."" Bateman excuses himself by telling Kimball he has a lunch appointment with Cliff Huxtable at the Four Seasons in 20 minutes. ""The Four Seasons? Isn't that a little far up town? I mean, aren't you going to be late?"" ""No, there's one down here."" Patrick promises to call him if he hears anything, and shows him the door.Patrick does stomach crunches while watching The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and then does some jump-rope.Nighttime. A seedy part of town. A blonde woman in a blue coat, a hooker, stands in front of a warehouse on a street corner. She has a face that says she's been hooker for too long. A limousine drives up. Patrick rolls the window down as the car stops in front of her. ""I haven't seen you around here,"" he tells her. ""Well you just haven't been looking."" ""Would you like to see my apartment?"" She is reluctant. He holds out some money and asks again. ""I'm not supposed to, but I can make an exception,"" she says, taking the money. ""Do you take a credit card? Just joking."" He opens the door and invites her in. The car drives away.Patrick makes a phone call on a large cordless phone. ""I'd like a girl, early 20's, blonde, who does couples. And I really can't stress blonde enough. Blonde."" He hangs up. He tells her his name is Paul Allen, and that he's going to call her Christie. ""You'll respond only to Christie, is that clear?"" She nods.Patrick's apartment. Patrick pours some mineral water into a bathtub, where Christie is bathing and drinking champagne. ""That's a very fine chardonnay you're drinking."" The song 'If You Don't Know Me by Now' is playing in the background. Patrick is dressed in a suit and bow tie. ""I want you to clean your vagina,"" he tells her. She puts down the champagne and picks up a bath sponge. ""From behind. Get on your knees."" He tells her she has a nice body, playfully splashing her with water. The phone rings. It's the second girl in the lobby downstairs. He tells the doorman to send her up. He tells Christie to dry off and choose a robe, then come to the living room.He opens the door for the second girl, and takes her coat. ""I'm Paul. Not quite blonde, are you? More like dirty blonde. I'm going to call you Sabrina. I'm Paul Allen."" He asks both girls if they want to know what he does for a living. They both say no, lewdly. ""Well, I work on Wall Street. At Pierce and Pierce. Have you heard of it?"" Sabrina shakes her head, and Patrick clenches his jaw. ""You have a really nice place here Paul,"" says Christie. ""How much did you pay for it?"" ""Well actually Christie, that's none of your business. But I can assure you, it certainly wasn't cheap."" Sabrina starts to take out a cigarette. ""No! No smoking in here."" He offers them chocolate truffles. ""I don't want to get you drunk, but uh, that's a very fine chardonnay you're not drinking."" He goes over to the stereo and puts on a Phil Collins CD. ""I've been a big Genesis fan ever since the release of their 1980 album, 'Duke'. Before that, I really didn't understand any of their work. It was too artsy. Too intellectual. It was on Duke where Phil Collin's presence became more apparent."" He goes and stands in the doorway of the bedroom, invitingly. ""I think Invisible Touch is the group's undisputed masterpiece."" The girls follow him into the bedroom. ""It's an epic meditation on intangibility. At the same time it deepens and enriches the meaning of the preceding three albums."" He tells Christie to take off the robe, which she does. ""Listen to the brilliant ensemble playing of Banks, Collins and Rutherford. You can practically hear every nuance of each instrument,"" he says, setting up a video camera on a tripod. He tells Sabrina to remove her dress. ""In terms of lyrical craftsmanship, and sheer songwriting, this album hits a new peak of professionalism. Sabrina, why don't you dance a little? Take the lyrics to 'Land of Confusion'. In this song, Phil Collins addresses the abuse of political authority. 'In Too Deep' is the most moving pop song of the 1980s,"" he continues, wrapping a scarf around Christie's neck while Sabrina dances in her lingerie. ""About monogamy and commitment. The song is extremely uplifting. Their lyrics are as positive and affirmative as anything I've heard in rock."" He turns the camera on and points it towards the bed. ""Christie, get down on your knees so Sabrina can see your asshole. Phil Collin's solo career seems to be more commercial, and therefore more satisfying in a narrower way. Especially songs like 'In the Air Tonight' and 'Against All Odds'. Sabrina, don't just stare at it, eat it. But I also think Phil Collins works better within the confines of the group than as a solo artist. And I stress the word 'artist'."" He goes to the stereo and switches CDs. ""This is 'Sussudio', a great, great song. A personal favorite."" He walks back to the bedroom, unbuttoning his shirt.He has sex with both women at once. He flexes his muscles and admires himself in the mirror while doing them doggy-style. He makes them look into the camera. They do oral sex, then missionary. Patrick flexes his muscles in the mirror again. Christie rolls her eyes. They do more doggy-style.Patrick sleeps with a woman on either side of him. He awakens some time later. Christie's arm touches his. ""Don't touch the watch."" He gets up and goes over to the dresser. The women get up and start to dress. He opens a drawer to reveal a collection of scissors, carving tools and other sharp objects. He takes out a coat hanger. ""Can we go now?"" asks Christie. ""We're not through yet.""Some time later, he pays them and shows them the door. They take the money quickly and appear to be in tears. Sabrina's nose is bleeding. They leave and he closes the door behind them.McDermott, Van Paten and Bateman are seated in a bar lounge with drinks in front of them, discussing women. ""If they have a good personality and they are not great looking, who fucking cares?"" says McDermott. ""Well let's just say hypothetically, what if they have a good personality?"" replies Bateman. There is a moment of silence, and then all three men burst out laughing. ""There are no girls with good personalities!"" they say in unison, high-fiving each other. Van Paten says ""A good personality consists of a chick with a little hard body who will satisfy all sexual demands without being too slutty about things, and who will essentially keep her dumb fucking mouth shut."" McDermott continues: ""The only girls with good personalities who are smart or maybe funny or halfway intelligent or talented, though god knows what the fuck that means, are ugly chicks."" Van Paten agrees. ""And this is because they have to make up for how fucking unattractive they are."" Bateman asks them if they know what Ed Gein said about women. Van Paten: ""Ed Gein? Maitre d' at Canal Bar?"" ""No. Serial killer. Wisconsin. The 50's."" ""What did Ed say?"" ""He said 'When I see a pretty girl walking down the street, I think two things. One part wants me to take her out, talk to her, be real nice and sweet and treat her right.'"" McDermott: ""And what did the other part of him think?"" ""What her head would look like on a stick!"" Bateman laughs heartily, but Van Paten and McDermott just look at each other nervously. Luis comes up to their table and says hello. He takes out his new business card and asks their opinion on it. It is a nice looking card with gold lettering. Van Paten says it looks nice. McDermott is uninterested. Bateman swallows as a dramatic crescendo of music starts. Luis leaves and walks up the stairs. Bateman watches him go and Luis gives him look back over his shoulder. Van Paten asks about dinner. ""Is that all you ever have to contribute?"" snaps Bateman. ""Fucking dinner?"" McDermott tells him to cheer up. ""What's the matter? No shiatsu this morning?"" Bateman pushes his hand away as he tries to touch his shoulder. ""Do that again and you'll draw back a stub."" McDermott tells him ""Hang on there little buddy,"" but Bateman stands up and goes up the stairs behind Luis.Putting on his leather gloves, he enters a bathroom with nice wallpaper and gold mirrors. He slowly walks up behind Luis who is using a urinal. Hands shaking, he slowly puts his fingers around Luis' neck. Luis turns around, looks at Patrick's hands, takes off one of his gloves, and plants a kiss on the back of his hand. ""God. Patrick, why here?"" Patrick is too shocked to say anything and he can't bring himself to kill Luis. ""I've seen you looking at me. I've noticed your... hot body,"" Luis says, rubbing a finger over Patrick's mouth. ""Don't be shy. You can't imagine how long I've wanted this, ever since that Christmas party at Arizona 206. You know the one where you were wearing that red striped paisley Armani tie..."" Patrick walks over to the sink in a daze and starts washing his hands, with his gloves still on. He looks like he's about to cry. Luis walks up behind him. ""I want you. I want you too!"" Patrick starts walking towards the door. ""Patrick?"" ""WHAT IS IT?"" he yells. ""Where are you going?"" ""I've got to return some videotapes.""He rushes down the stairs. He runs into a man holding a tray of glasses. Looking up the stairs, he sees Luis make a 'call me' gesture with his hand. He leaves without saying a word to McDermott or Van Paten.Patrick walks down the hall to his office. He stops. Kimball is leaning over Jean's desk, talking to her about any reservations Paul Allen might have made. ""I've been wanting to talk with you, come into my office,"" Patrick says, shaking his hand. ""Jean. Great jacket. Matsuda?""Inside his office. ""Do you remember where you were the night of Paul's disappearance?"" asks Kimball. ""Which was on the 20th of December."" ""God. I guess I was probably returning videotapes."" He looks at his datebook. ""I had a date with a girl named Veronica."" ""That's not what I've got,"" says Kimball. ""What?"" ""That's not the information I've received."" ""What information have you received? I could be wrong."" ""When was the last time you were with Paul Allen?"" ""We'd gone to a new musical called 'Oh Africa, Brave Africa'. It was laugh riot. That was about it. I think we had dinner. I hope I've been informative. Long day. I'm a bit scattered."" ""I'm a bit scattered too. How about lunch in a week or so, when I've sorted out all of this information?"" Patrick says okay. Kimball asks him to sort out exactly where he was on the night of the disappearance. ""Absolutely. I'm with you on that one."" Kimball takes a CD out of his briefcase. ""Huey Lewis and the News! Great stuff! I just bought it on my way over here! Have you heard it?"" Patrick is stunned, and terrified of possibly becoming friends with this man. ""Never. I mean I don't really like singers."" ""Not a big music fan, huh?"" ""No I like music, just they're... Huey's too black sounding for me."" ""To each his own."" Kimball closes his briefcase. ""So, lunch next week?"" ""I'll be there.""Patrick and Courtney are having sex. Patrick orgasms, then rolls off her. He pulls a stuffed black cat from underneath himself, putting it on Courtney's lap. He gets off the bed and starts getting dressed in front of a mirror. ""Will you call me before Easter?"" she asks. ""Maybe."" ""What are you doing tonight?"" ""Dinner at uh, River Cafe."" ""That's nice,"" she says, lighting a cigarette. ""I never knew you smoked."" ""You never noticed. Listen, Patrick, can we talk?"" ""You look... marvelous. There's nothing to say,"" he says, shutting her out. ""You're going to marry Luis."" ""Isn't that special... Patrick? If I don't see you before Easter, have a nice one okay?"" she asks, with a hint of depression in her voice. ""You too."" He starts to leave. ""Patrick?"" ""Yeah?"" ""Nothing..."" He leaves.A club. Androgynous men and women pack the dance floor. The song 'Pump up the Volume' is playing. Bryce is telling Bateman about STDs while in line to use private stalls for drugs. ""There's this theory now that if you can catch the AIDS virus by having sex with someone who is infected, you can catch anything. Alzheimer's, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, leukemia, diabetes, dyslexia!"" ""I'm not sure but I don't think dyslexia is a disease,"" says Bateman. ""But who knows? They don't know that. Prove it."" Bryce snorts some white powder. ""Oh God. It's a fucking milligram of sweetener."" Patrick sniffs some. ""I want to get high off this, not sprinkle it on my fucking oatmeal."" ""It's definitely weak, but I have a feeling if we do enough of it we'll be okay,"" says Bateman. Someone leans over the divider. ""Could you keep it down? I'm trying to do drugs!"" ""Fuck you!"" says Bryce. Bateman tells him to calm down. ""We'll do it anyway."" ""That is if the faggot in the next STALL thinks it's okay!"" ""Fuck you!"" says the man. ""Fuck YOU!"" says Bryce. ""Sorry dude. Steroids. Okay let's do it.""A club balcony. The song 'What's On Your Mind' is playing. Three blonde women are seated across from Patrick. One of them asks where Craig went. Bryce tells them Gorbachev is downstairs and McDermott went to sign a peace treaty. ""He's the one behind Glasnost."" Bryce makes a 'he went to get cocaine' gesture to Bateman by tapping his nose. ""I thought he was in mergers and acquisitions,"" she says. ""You're not confused are you?"" asks Bryce. ""No, not really."" Another woman says ""Gorbachev is NOT downstairs."" ""Karen's right, Gorbachev is not down stairs. He's at Tunnel."" Bateman tells one of the girls to ask him a question. ""So what do you do?"" ""I'm into uh, well murders and executions mostly."" ""Do you like it?"" ""Well that depends, why?"" ""Well most guys I know, who work in mergers and acquisitions, really don't like it."" He asks her where she works out.On the street, Patrick and the girl are talking. ""You think I'm dumb don't you. You think all models are dumb."" ""No. I really don't."" ""That's okay. I don't mind. There's something sweet about you."" They both get in the back of a cab. Somewhere a car alarm is going off.Patrick is lounging on the sofa in his office. He has sunglasses on. Between his fingers is a lock of blonde hair. Jean knocks on his door, and he quickly stuffs the hair into his shirt pocket. He picks up a paper and starts twirling a pen. She enters slowly, wearing a baggy brown coat and beige shirt. ""Doin' the crossword?"" she asks. Every line of the crossword is filled in with either 'meat' or 'bones'. She asks him if he needs any help, but he ignores her. She puts something on his desk. As she walks back to the door, he says ""Jean, would you like to accompany me to dinner? That is, if you're not doing anything."" She says she doesn't have any plans. He sits up and crosses his legs. ""Well! Isn't this a coincidence. Listen, where should we go?"" She says she doesn't care where. ""How about anywhere you want?"" he tells her. ""I don't know Patrick, I can't make this decision."" ""Come on!"" he says, chuckling and pointing his pen at her. ""Where do you want to go? Anywhere you want, just say it, I can get us in anywhere."" She thinks for a minute. ""How about..."" Patrick flips through his Zagat booklet. ""Dorsia?"" Patrick looks up. ""So. Dorsia is where Jean wants to go."" ""I don't know, we'll go wherever you want to go."" ""Dorsia is fine."" He picks up a phone and dials the restaurant. ""Dorsia, yes?"" says the man on the other end. Can you take two tonight at, oh, say nine o'clock?"" ""We're totally booked."" ""Really? That's great."" ""No I said we are totally booked!"" ""Two at nine? Perfect! See you then!"" He hangs up. Jean gives him a quizzical look. ""Yeah?"" he asks, taking off his sunglasses. ""You're... dressed okay."" ""You didn't give a name."" ""They know me,"" he lies. ""Why don't you meet me at my place at 7:00 for drinks?"" She smiles and starts to leave. ""And Jean? You might want to change before we go out.""Jean looks out the window of Patrick's place. A telescope is pointed out the window. She's dressed in a pretty green strapless dress. ""Patrick it's so elegant. What a wonderful view."" Patrick gets some frozen sorbet out of the fridge. Next to the sorbet is a severed head wrapped in plastic. ""Jean, sorbet?"" ""Thanks Patrick. I'd love some."" He gives it to her. ""Do you want a bite?"" ""I'm on a diet, but thank you,"" he says. ""No need to lose any weight. You're kidding right? You look great,"" she tells him. ""Very fit."" ""You can always be thinner... look better."" ""Well, maybe we shouldn't go out to dinner. I don't want to ruin your willpower."" ""That's alright. I'm not very good at controlling it anyway."" He goes over to a kitchen drawer and starts running his finger over some steak knives. ""So, what do you want to do with your life? Just briefly summarize. And don't tell me you enjoy working with children."" She tells him she'd like to travel and maybe go back to school. ""I don't really know. I'm at a point in my life where there seems to be so many possibilities."" Patrick runs his hand across some stainless steel meat cleavers on a triangular base. ""I'm just so unsure."" He asks her if she has a boyfriend. ""No, not really."" ""Interesting."" ""Are you seeing anyone? I mean, seriously?"" she asks. ""Maybe. I don't know. Not really,"" he says with a smile. ""Jean, do you feel, fulfilled? I mean, in your life?"" ""I guess I do. For a long time I was too focused on my work. But now I've really begun to think about changing myself, developing and growing."" Patrick reaches into a closet and takes out some silver duct tape. ""Growing. I'm glad you said that. Did you know that Ted Bundy's first dog, a collie, was named Lassie?"" he laughs. ""Who's Ted Bundy?"" ""Forget it."" ""What's that?"" ""Duct tape. I need it for... taping something."" ""Patrick, have you ever wanted to make someone happy?"" She starts to put her spoon down on his coffee table. ""No! Put it in the carton!"" ""Sorry."" He takes something else out of the closet and walks behind her. She repeats her question. ""I'm looking for uh..."" He holds up a nail gun and points it at the back of her unsuspecting head. ""I guess you could say I just want to have a meaningful relationship with someone special."" His finger moves toward the trigger. The phone rings, and the answering machine picks it up. It's Evelyn. ""Patrick... Patrick! I know you're there. Pick up the phone you bad boy. What are you up to tonight?"" He puts the nailgun down behind the couch. ""It's me. Don't try to hide. I hope you're not out there with some number you picked up because you're MY Mr. Bateman. My boy next door."" Jean sips some wine, looking at Patrick as she listens. ""Anyway you never called me and you said you would, and I'll leave a message for Jean about this tomorrow to remind you, but we're having dinner with Melania and Taylor, you know Melania she went to Sweetbriar. And we're meeting at the Cornell club. So I'll see you tomorrow morning honey!"" Patrick winces. ""Sorry I know you hate that. Bye Patrick. Bye Mr. Big Time CEO. Bye bye."" She hangs up. Jean says ""Was that Evelyn? Are you still seeing her?"" He doesn't answer. ""I'm sorry. I have no right to ask that. Do you want me to go?"" ""Yeah,"" he finally says. ""I don't think I can control myself."" ""I know I should go. I know I have a tendency to get involved with unavailable men."" She asks him if he wants her to go. ""I think if you stay, something bad will happen. I think I might hurt you. You don't want to get hurt, do you?"" ""No, I guess not. I don't want to get bruised."" She gets up and starts leaving. On her way out, she reminds him that he has a dinner date with Kimball the next day. ""Thanks. It slipped my mind completely.""A crowded restaurant. Bateman and Kimball sit across from each other, eating some beef dishes. ""So. The night he disappeared. Any thoughts about what you did?"" asks Kimball. ""I'm not sure. Uh, I had a shower, and some sorbet?"" ""I think you're getting your dates mixed up."" ""Well, where do you place Paul that night?"" He tells Patrick that according to his datebook, Paul had dinner with Marcus Halberstram, thought Marcus denied it. ""Does Marcus have an alibi?"" ""Yes. I've checked it out, it's clean. Now, where were you?"" ""Well, where was Marcus?"" ""He wasn't with Paul Allen. He was at Atlantis with Craig McDermott, Fredrick Dibble, Harry Newman, George Butner, and... you."" Patrick looks up. ""Oh right, yeah, of course."" Kimball makes a 'slipped your mind' gesture. ""We had wanted Paul Allen to come, but he had made plans. And I guess I had dinner with Victoria the following night."" Kimball says ""Personally, I think the guy just went a little nutso, split town for a while, maybe he did go to London. Sightseeing, drinking, whatever. Anyway, I'm pretty sure he'll turn up sooner or later. I mean, to think that one of his friends killed him for no reason whatsoever would be too ridiculous. Isn't that right Patrick?"" he says with an eerie smile. Patrick smiles back faintly.Patrick takes a limo to the part of town where he met Christie. She's standing on the same corner. He rolls down the window and calls out to her. ""I'm not so sure about this,"" she tells him. ""I had to go to emergency last time."" He promises that this won't be anything like last time. She says no. ""Just come in the limo and talk to me for a minute. The driver is here. You'll be safe."" He holds out some money. Reluctantly, she takes it and gets in. He hands her a drink. ""Nothing like last time. I promise,"" he repeats. ""Alright."" He tells her she's looking great, and asks how she's been. ""I might need a little surgery after last time. My friend told me I should maybe even get a lawyer."" ""Lawyers are so complicated,"" he says, writing her a cheque. She takes it and bolts from the car. The car keeps pace with her as she walks. Bateman rolls down the window and whistles at her, waving more money. She stops and looks at the wad. She tries to grab it, but he pulls his hand back. He opens the car door again, moving over to let her get back in. ""Half now, half later."" He closes the door. He tells her her name is Christie again, and that they are meeting a friend of his named Elizabeth. ""She'll be joining us in my new apartment shortly. You'll like her. She's a very nice girl.""Paul Allen's apartment. Patrick breaks open a capsule of ecstasy onto a spoon, and puts it into a bottle of wine. A redhead woman in a white silk shirt and black jacket is sitting on the couch across from Christie. She tells her she looks familiar. ""Did you go to Dalton? I think I met you at a surf bar, didn't I. It was spicy. Well maybe not spicy but it was definitely a surf bar."" She talks on and on in a self-important tone, neither Patrick or Christie really listening to her. Christie tells Patrick that this place is nicer than his other one. ""It's not that nice,"" he says. She asks where he and Elizabeth met. She says it was at the Kentucky Derby in 86. ""You were hanging out with that bimbo Alison Poole. Hot number."" ""What do you mean? She was a hot number."" ""If you had a platinum card she'd give you a blowjob. Listen, this girl worked at a tanning salon, need I say more?"" She sips her wine. She asks what Christie does. ""She's my... cousin. She's from... France,"" says Bateman. Elizabeth asks for the phone to call someone. She asks if Christie summers in Southampton. The person she's calling doesn't answer. ""Elizabeth, it's 3 in the morning."" ""He's a god damn drug dealer, these are his peak hours."" She says that the wine tastes weird. She leaves the man a message on his answering machine. She looks at Bateman when she can't remember where she is. ""Paul Allen's."" ""I want the number idiot. Anyway I'm at Paul Norman's and I'll try you again later, and if I don't see you at Canal Bar tomorrow I'm going to sic my hairdresser on you."" She hangs up. ""Did you know that guy who disappeared, didn't he work at Pierce and Pierce? Was he a friend of yours?"" He says no. She asks if he has any coke. He shakes his head. ""Or a Halcyon? I would take a Halcyon."" ""Listen,"" he says. ""I would just like to see the two of you *get it on*."" They stare at him. ""What's wrong with that? It's totally disease-free."" ""Patrick you're a lunatic."" He asks her if she finds Christie attractive. ""Let's not get lewd. I'm in no mood for lewd conversation."" He says he thinks it would be a turn-on. She asks Christie if he does this all the time. Christie remains silent. He tells her to drink her wine. ""You're telling me you've never gotten it on with a girl?"" he asks Elizabeth. ""No. I'm not a lesbian. Why would you think I would be into that?"" ""Well, you went to Sarah Lawrence for one thing."" ""Those are Sarah Lawrence GUYS, Patrick. You're making me feel weird.""Some time later, the drugs having kicked in, and Elizabeth and Christie are feeling each other up on the couch. Patrick says wistfully ""Did you know that Whitney Houston's debut LP, called simply 'Whitney Houston', had four number-one singles on it? Did you know that Christie?"" Elizabeth starts laughing. ""You actually listen to Whitney Houston? You own a Whitney Houston CD? More than one?"" she laughs, falling off the couch. ""It's hard to choose a favorite amongst so many great tracks. But 'The Greatest Love of All' is one of the best, most powerful songs ever written, about self-preservation, dignity, its universal message crosses all boundaries and instills one with the hope that it's not too late to better ourselves."" Elizabeth is still laughing. ""Since, Elizabeth, it's impossible in this world we live in to empathize with others, but we can always empathize with ourselves. It's an important message, crucial really, and it's beautifully stated on the album.""All three have sex, Patrick on top of both of them. He moves his face down to Elizabeth's torso, and she starts giggling. Christie rolls out from underneath them. She watches them as they fool around under the sheets, and she starts gathering her clothes. A stain begins to form on the sheets: Blood. Elizabeth is screaming. Patrick looks up at Christie with blood on his mouth and a crazed look on his face. Christie runs out of the room, and Patrick chases her naked. She runs to a door and throws it open, to reveal a closet with two dead women in plastic bags hanging on coathangers. The full horror of Patrick's existence finally revealed to her, she lets out a bloodcurdling scream. She enters another room and almost vomits. Spraypainted on the wall is the words 'DIE YUPPIE SCUM' and the room is covered with blood and faeces. She backs out and sees Patrick turn the corner naked wielding a chainsaw. She cuts through a maze of doors and finally runs into a bathroom. She falls into a pool of blood next to another dead, naked woman. Patrick runs in, covered in Elizabeth's blood and starts biting her leg. She kicks him in the face and runs. ""Not the face! Not the fucking face you piece of bitch trash!"" She runs through the living room and out into the hallway, pounding and screaming on neighbours' doors, but to no avail. Patrick runs after her, stark nude, and chainsaw in hand. She runs down a circular set of stairs. Patrick reaches the top and holds the chainsaw out over the gap, waiting for the right moment. When she nears the bottom, he lets go, and the chainsaw falls end over end, finally hitting its target. He screams in victory. The chainsaw has impaled Christie through the back.Patrick doodles a woman impaled with a chainsaw with a crayon on a paper tablecloth. He hasn't touched his dessert. Evelyn is sitting next to him, asking him to commit to their relationship. The restaurant is crowded with middle-class looking people. ""I think Evelyn, that uh, we've lost touch."" ""Why, what's wrong?"" she asks, waving to someone. A woman flashes a gold bracelet to her, and she mouths ""It's beautiful. I love it."" ""My need to engage in homicidal behaviour on a massive scale cannot be corrected, but uh, I have no other way to fulfill my needs. We need to talk. It's over, it's all over,"" he tells her, scratching a red X over his drawing. ""Touchy touchy. I'm sorry I brought up the wedding. Let's just avoid the issue, alright? Now, are we having coffee?"" ""I'm fucking serious. It's fucking over, us, this is no joke, uh, I don't think we should see each other any more."" ""But your friends are my friends, and my friends are your friends. I really don't think it would work."" She tries to brush some food away from the corner of his mouth, but her stops her. ""I know that your friends are my friends, and I've thought about that. You can have 'em."" She finally understands. ""You're really serious, aren't you? What about the past? Our past?"" ""We never really shared one,"" he replies. ""You're inhuman."" ""No. I'm-I'm in touch with humanity."" She starts crying. ""Evelyn I'm sorry, I just uh... you're not terribly important to me."" She cries so loudly that the whole restaurant turns to look at her. ""I know my behaviour can be *erratic* sometimes..."" ""What is it that you want?"" she cries. ""If you really want to do something for me then stop making this scene *right now*!"" he snaps. ""Oh God I can't believe this,"" she weeps. ""I'm leaving,"" he says. ""I've assessed the situation and I'm leaving."" ""But where are you going?"" ""I have to return some videotapes.""Evening. Patrick stops near the lobby of a building to use an ATM. He sticks his card in the machine. Looking down he sees a stray cat. ""Here kitty kitty."" He picks up the cat and starts petting it. A message comes on the screen of the ATM: 'FEED ME A STRAY CAT'. He tries to put the cat in the card slot of the ATM, but it pushes itself away. He pulls out a 9mm pistol and points it at the cat's head. A woman in a fur coat sees this. ""Oh my God. What you doing? Stop that!"" He shoots her in the chest and she falls to the ground. He lets the cat go. A siren is heard a block away, and a police car pulls up at the other end of the lobby. He takes his card and walks away. He tries to steal a car, but every car on the street is locked, and he only winds up setting off all their car alarms. He kicks the back of a Porsche and runs. Two police cars cut him off on the next street. They get out, guns drawn. ""Drop the weapon! Drop it now! Get on the ground!"" He starts to put his hands up, then turns the gun on the officers. They exchange gunfire. He runs behind a parked car for cover, firing and hitting one of them. He fires five more shots, and both police cars explode in a massive fireball. Stunned by his luck, he looks at the gun, then at his watch, and walks away. He breaks into a run, under the support columns of a skyscraper. He walks into the lobby of an apartment. ""Burning the midnight oil, Mr. Smith? Don't forget to sign in,"" says the man at the desk. He pulls out the gun and shoots him in the head. He runs past the elevators. One of them opens and a janitor gets out. He goes around a revolving door, back into the lobby, shoots the janitor, then out the other side. He runs into another lobby. Out of breath and drenched in sweat, he goes up to the desk. Smiling at the doorman, he reaches into his pocket and pulls out a pen, signs in, and goes up in the elevator, crying.He reaches his office. He looks out the window, then hides from the searchlight of a passing police helicopter. Still crying, he makes a phone call. An answering machine picks it up. ""Harold, it's Bateman. You're my lawyer so I think you should know, I've killed a lot of people. Some girls in the apartment uptown uh, some homeless people maybe 5 or 10, um an NYU girl I met in Central Park. I left her in a parking lot behind some donut shop. I killed Bethany, my old girlfriend, with a nail gun, and some man, some old faggot with a dog last week. I killed another girl with a chainsaw, I had to, she almost got away and uh someone else there I can't remember maybe a model, but she's dead too. And Paul Allen. I killed Paul Allen with an axe in the face, his body is dissolving in a bathtub in Hell's Kitchen. I don't want to leave anything out here. I guess I've killed maybe 20 people, maybe 40. I have tapes of a lot of it, uh some of the girls have seen the tapes. I even, um..."" He almost can't say it. ""I ate some of their brains. I tried to cook a little."" He starts laughing. ""Tonight I, uh, hahahaha... I just had to kill a LOT of people!"" Crying again. ""And I'm not sure I'm gonna get away with it this time. I guess I'll uh, I mean, ah, I guess I'm a pretty uh, I mean I guess I'm a pretty sick guy."" He's smiling. ""So, if you get back tomorrow, I may show up at Harry's Bar, so you know, keep your eyes open."" He hangs up and tries to compose himself. The helicopter can still be heard buzzing around but is getting fainter.Morning. He showers and picks a suit from his walk-in closet. He goes to Paul Allen's place, putting on a surgical mask because of the smell of the bodies he left there. Opening the door, he finds the place empty and repainted white. Three people are talking in one of the rooms, and the floor is lined with cloth and there is a ladder and some other redecorating equipment. He heads towards the closet where he left two bodies. It contains only paint cans, ladders and buckets. He takes off the mask, stunned. ""Are you my 2:00?"" asks a well-dressed 40-something woman behind him. ""No."" ""Can I help you?"" ""I'm looking for Paul Allen's place. Doesn't he live here?"" ""No he doesn't. Did you see the ad in the Times?"" ""No. Yeah. I mean yeah. In the times."" ""There was no ad in the times. I think you should go now."" He asks what happened here. She tells him not to make any trouble, and tells him again that he should leave. He starts to leave. ""Don't come back,"" she warns. ""I won't. Don't worry."" He closes the door behind him.Outside, Bateman calls Jean from a payphone. He downs the rest of a bottle of pills while he waits for her to pick up. She answers. ""Jean... I need help."" He sounds distraught. ""Patrick is that you? Craig McDermott called, he wants to meet you, Van Paten and Bryce at Harry's Bar for drinks."" ""What did you say you dumb bitch..."" he croaks. ""Patrick I can't hear you."" ""What am I doing?"" he laughs. ""Where are you Patrick? What's wrong?"" He starts crying. ""I don't think I'm going to... make it, Jean. To the uh, office, this afternoon."" ""Why?"" She sounds worried. ""JUST... SAY... NO!"" he screams. ""What is it? Patrick, are you alright?"" ""Stop sounding so fucking SAD! JESUS!"" he screams, laughing. He hangs up, then tries to compose himself.Jean goes to Patrick's desk. She opens a drawer and finds a leather notebook. The first few pages have regular appointments. One page has a drawing of someone getting killed with a shotgun in the mouth.Patrick reaches Harry's Bar. He straightens his dishevelled hair and goes inside. Bryce, Van Paten and McDermott are sitting and drinking. McDermott tells him he looks wild-eyed. ""Rough day at the office?"" Bryce is drinking mineral water. ""He's a changed man! But he still can't get a reservation to save his life."" Bateman tells them he isn't going anywhere unless they have a reservation. They discuss various restaurants. Bateman spots his lawyer, Harold Carnes, across the room, and excuses himself. His lawyer is telling someone how the Japanese will own most of the country by the end of the '90s. ""Shut up, Carnes, they will not. So uh, did you get my message?"" ""Jesus yes! That was hilarious! That *was* you, wasn't it! Bateman killing Allen and the escort girls. That's fabulous. That's rich."" He asks him what he means. ""The message you left. By the way Davis, how's Cynthia? You're still seeing her, right?"" ""What do you mean?"" ""Nothing. It's good to see you. Is that Edward Towers?"" He starts to walk away but Bateman stops him. ""Davis. I'm not one to bad-mouth anyone. Your joke was amusing. But come on man. You had one fatal flaw. Bateman is such a dork, such a boring, spineless lightweight. Now if you said Bryce, or McDermott, otherwise it was amusing. Now if you'll excuse me, I really must be going."" For some odd reason, Carnes keeps calling Patrick ""Davis"". Patrick angrily stops him again. ""I did it, Carnes! I killed him! I'm Patrick Bateman! I chopped Allen's fucking head off,"" he whispers with tears in his eyes. ""The whole message I left on your machine was true."" Carnes tries to leave again. ""No! Listen, don't you know who I am? I'm not Davis, I'm Patrick Bateman!"" He no longer sounds sure who he is. ""We talk on the phone all the time. Don't you recognize me? You're my lawyer."" He tells Carnes to listen carefully. ""I killed Paul Allen. And I liked it. I can't make myself any clearer."" Carnes tells him that that isn't possible. ""And I don't find this funny anymore."" ""It never was supposed to be! Why isn't it possible?"" ""It's just not."" ""Why not you stupid bastard?"" says Patrick. ""Because I had dinner with Paul Allen in London twice, just ten days ago."" ""No you... didn't."" Patrick is stunned. He begins to doubt whether he actually killed Allen or not or all those other people. Maybe it was all a fantasy. Maybe Patrick Bateman's real name is Davis. Carnes excuses himself again and he lets him go.Jean continues to look with horror through Patrick's notebook. A crude drawing of a woman getting her limbs cut off with a chainsaw. A naked woman nailed to boards. The more pages she turns, the worse the images get. Page after page is filled with shocking fantasies of rape, murder and mutilation of women.Patrick returns to the table. The guys are watching President Ronald Reagan talking about Iran-Contra on TV. ""How can he lie like that?"" says Bryce. Van Paten continues to ask where they have reservations, even though he isn't really hungry. ""How can he be so fucking... I don't know, cool about it?"" ""Some guys are just born cool I guess,"" says Van Paten. Bateman starts laughing. ""Bateman? What are you so fucking zany about?"" ""Ha ha, I'm just a happy camper! Rockin' and a-rollin'!"" Turning back to Reagan on the TV, Bryce says ""He presents himself as this harmless old codger, but inside... but inside..."" ""But inside doesn't matter,""A baffled Bateman narrates: ""Inside, yes? Inside? Believe it or not Bryce, we're actually listening to you,"" says McDermott. Bryce asks Bateman what he thinks. ""Whatever."" Van Paten says he doesn't like dry beers and needs a scotch. Bateman looks over the faces of the people in the room as he narrates. ""There are no more barriers to cross. All I have in common with the uncontrollable and the insane, the vicious and the evil, all the mayhem I have caused and my utter indifference toward it I have now surpassed. My pain is constant and sharp, and I do not hope for a better world for anyone. In fact, I want my pain to be inflicted on others, and no one to escape. My punishment continues to elude me. My confession has meant nothing."""

Marley (Robert Forster), co-pilot Nick Vanzant (James Spader), medical officer Kaela Evers (Angela Bassett), medical technician Yerzy Penalosa (Lou Diamond Phillips), search and rescue paramedic Danika Lund (Robin Tunney) and computer technician Benjamin Sotomejor (Wilson Cruz). Aboard their vessel, the Nightingale 229, they receive an emergency distress signal coming from an ice mining operation on the moon Titan 37, more than 3,000 light-years away.The crew answers the call and dimension-jumps-during which Captain Marley suffers fatal injuries due to a malfunction of the ship's equipment-arriving in the path of Titan 37's debris cloud, some of which damages the ship and causes the loss of 82 percent of its maneuvering fuel. Worse still, Titan 37 orbits a blue giant, and its high gravity field will pull the ship to the point where it will be incinerated in 17 hours, 12 minutes-which happens to be almost the same amount of time that the Nightingale 229 will need to recharge its jump drive, their only possible hope for escape. With only an 11-minute window for escape, the surviving crew soon find themselves in danger from the disturbing young man (Peter Facinelli) they rescue, and the mysterious alien artifact he has smuggled aboard. This artifact is analyzed by the ship's computer and is said to contain nine-dimensional matter.It is ultimately discovered that the young man who called for rescue is actually Karl Larson, an old former lover of Kaela (it is implied they had an abusive relationship). Karl came into contact with the nine-dimensional matter after recovering the artifact. It somehow enabled him to acquire super-strength and supernatural healing abilities, and made him younger (such that Kaela did not recognize him). Karl murders most of the crew except Kaela and strands Nick on the mining platform. Karl unsuccessfully attempts to romantically reconcile with Kaela. Nick finds his way back to the medical ship through a rescue pod left on the mining platform, and a battle ensues between Nick and Karl. Karl is ultimately killed by Kaela using explosives placed near the alien artifact which Karl was obsessed with retrieving. The explosion ejects the artifact into space, hurtling it towards the blue giant.With moments left before the dimension jump activates, Kaela and Nick place themselves into the only remaining dimensional stabilization chamber (Karl had destroyed all but one), which is the only thing that enables human beings to survive the ship's dimensional jump drive. The pods are meant to hold only one person; however, two subjects might be genetically mixed during the dimensional jump. Before Nick and Kaela enter the only remaining pod, the computer warns them that the nine-dimensional matter is reacting with the gravity of the blue giant sun and will cause a nine-dimensional reaction that will spread in all directions, such that the reaction's resulting supernova will reach Earth within 51 years. The computer hypothesizes that the reaction will either destroy life on Earth or ""enable humankind to achieve a new level of existence"". Just before the blue giant supernovas, the ship engages in a dimensional jump which brings Nick and Kaela back to Earth. As a result of their being in the same pod, the two of them each have one eye of the other person's original eye color. The ship's computer also reveals that Kaela is pregnant, which may be the result of them being in the pod together during the jump, or the result of their copulation hours earlier."

The Little Vampire,2000,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0192255/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A lonely American boy living in Scotland makes a new best friend, a fellow nine year-old who happens to be a vampire. With indecipherable, spine-chilling visions about vampires haunting his sleep, unpopular Tony, a lonely 9-year-old American boy living in Scotland, finds it impossible to make new friends at school. But they say be careful what you wish for. When Tony catches the eye of the mysterious Rudolph, he is about to discover that the blood-sucking creatures exist. As the two boys share a strange connection, something unexpected happens: Tony finds meaning in his dreams and embarks on a dangerous quest to help Rudolph retrieve a magic amulet of power. With the fate of the vampire clan hanging by a thread, can the little vampire protect his only friend?—Nick Riganas Based on the popular books, the story tells of Tony who wants a friend to add some adventure to his life. What he gets is Rudolph, a vampire kid with a good appetite. The two end up inseparable, but their fun is cut short when all the hopes of the vampire race could be gone forever in single night. With Tony's access to the daytime world, he helps them to find what they've always wanted.—Max Vaughn Tony Thompson [Jonathon Lipnicki] is lonely and friendless. His parents, Bob and Dottie,
have just moved him from San Diego, California to Scotland, and the two
McAshton boys, Nigel [Iain De Caestecker] and Flint [Scott Fletcher], are making fun of him at his new school
because of his obsession with vampires. Unfortunately, Nigel and Flint are
the grandsons of Lord McAshton, Bob's boss.One night, a bat flies into Tony's room. The bat is Rudolph Sackville-Bagg
[Rollo Weeks], vampire, and he's in a bad way. He can't fly, and the
vampire hunter Rookery [Jim Carter] is looking for him. Rudolph desperately needs blood
and asks Tony to lead him to a cow. While Tony waits for Rudolph to finish
his dinner, Rookery attempts to run Tony over with his vampire-hunting
mobile, but Rudolph saves him just in time. Tony and Rudolph are now
tit-for-tat, each having saved the other. They decide to become friends.
Rudolph sleeps the next day in Tony's toybox but is gone when Tony
gets home from school. Rudolph shows up again that night, asking about a
picture Tony drew of an amulet he saw in a dream, the amulet of Attamon,
made by the Great Magician from a piece of the comet of Attamon. Tony
offers to help Rudolph find it because it could mean the end of a curse
that causes Rudolph and his family to remain vampires. Unfortunately,
Rookery is also seeking the amulet because, used in another way, it can
send all the vampires straight to hell.
Suddenly, Rudolph's family shows up...father Frederick, mother Freda,
sister Anna, and brother Gregory. Frederick is not happy that his son has
befriended a human. Just then, Rookery shows up and starts firing stakes
at the vampire family. Tony cuts the hose between Rookery's stakegun and
his pneumatic air supply. The vampires and Tony take refuge in an
underground crypt, and Tony has a vision in which he sees a woman covering
the body of the Great Magician with a blanket bearing a crest flanked by
two stags and a banner reading ""Sola animo at manuforti.""Later that night, Tony and Rudolph pay a visit to the McAshton boys.
Tony presents himself as the Lord of the Underworld and Rudolph as ""the
fiendish friend of Tony Thompson,"" and orders the boys to treat Tony with
respect or else they will be bat-bait. The next day at school, the
McAshton boys trip all over themselves to be nice to Tony. It appears that
Tony's problems with the McAshton boys are over.
However, his problems with the McAshtons are just beginning. That
afternoon at tea, Tony's dad shows him a picture of the McAshton crest. Lo
and behold, it is the one from Tony's vision. Later that evening, Tony
goes to the crypt to tell Rudolph of his discovery, only to find Rookery
there. Rookery lowers a bright light into the crypt, but Tony throws a
rock at it and breaks the bulb. Unfortunately, Rudolph's father takes the
full brunt of the light and is severely weakened. After fortifying their
dad on some cowblood, the vampire family moves into Tony's cellar in order
to hide from Rookery. During the night, as Tony tries to sleep, Anna [Anna Popplewell] comes
into his room. She gives him a good luck charm (a dead mouse) from the old
country and tells him to whistle if he should ever need her help.It's Saturday morning, and Tony goes to work with his dad, hoping to
learn more about the McAshton crest and the whereabouts of the amulet.
Unfortunately, Rookery is also there, and Lord McAshton is telling him
about the family history. It seems that the woman in Tony's vision, the
one in which he sees her covering the body of the Great Magician with a
blanket that bears the McAshton crest, was actually Lord McAshton's
ancestor, Elizabeth, and the Great Magician was the vampire Von
Sackville-Bagg. Even more important is the fact that Elizabeth is wearing
the amulet of Attamon in a family portrait and was probably buried with
it. Rookery asks where she is buried, so Lord McAshton takes him to the
family crypt. They open her coffin, but it is empty. Most likely, she was
buried elsewhere, but where?Tony, who has been watching from a balcony, suddenly falls
off...right into the coffin. Rookery, who has also been after Tony, closes
the lid. Tony can't get out, but he remembers his good luck mouse and
whistles for Anna. Although it is daylight, Rudolph and Anna cover
themselves with a blanket and helmets and go to Tony. A mouse leads the
three of them to a secret passage in which they find the real coffin of
Elizabeth McAshton and Von Sackville-Bagg, but the amulet isn't there.
Suddenly, Tony has another vision of Elizabeth burying the stone under the
floorboards of her room...which is now Tony's room.
Rudolph and Tony go to Tony's bedroom and start prying up the
floorboards, but Rookery is wise to them. When Tony refuses to hand over
the stone, Rookery takes Tony, stone and all, for a ride in his
vampiremobile. As they drive along, they are attacked by a herd of flying
vampire cows (the cows on which Rudolph and his family have been feeding)
who cover Rookery's windshield with cowpies.Meanwhile, Frederick and Freda realize that tonight is the night that
the Attamon comet will cross the moon, and all the vampires must be called
to unite on the cliffs. Frederick is still too weak to fly, so they
introduce themselves to Tony's parents and invite them to view the comet,
too, using their car to drive out there. The entire vampire clan is
gathered on the cliff, but where is the amulet?
At the last minute, Rudolph and Tony fly in. Tony gives the amulet to
Frederick who says the magic words. A red light descends from the comet, a
red fog creeps over the vampires, and they all disappear.Epilogue: It is some weeks later. Tony and his parents are at the market in
town when a new family moves in. It is the Sackville-Baggs, but they are
human now. At first they don't recognize Tony, but a little whistle from
Tony brings back their memories. [Original Synopsis by bj_kuehl.]"

Highlander: Endgame,2000,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0144964/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Immortals Connor and Duncan MacLeod must join forces against Kell, an evil immortal who has become too strong for anyone to face alone. When Connor MacLeod sees his old friend Rachel die in an explosion, he's had it with his immortal life and the endless pain it brings him and those he loves. He locks himself inside the Sanctuary, a Watcher-organized retreat stationed on holy ground, where immortals who are tired of the game can go to forever escape it, as well as to ensure that The Prize never falls into the wrong hands. But when an old enemy, Jacob Kell, and his posse of assassins attack the Sanctuary and kill everyone there but Connor, he is forced out into the open and into battle. Kell and Connor were friends once, and knew each other back when Connor was cast from Glenfinnan; he returned when news came that his mother was to be burned at the stake, and in the attempt to free her, Kell was killed by none other than Connor himself, and became an immortal, bitter with hate, and devoted to making Connor's life a living hell. In the present day, Connor's kinsman Duncan MacLeod is attacked by Kell's posse, including Kate, an old love of Duncan's who seeks revenge for her unwillingly being made an immortal centuries ago. This attack had something to do with Connor, and Duncan goes in search of him to find out why. In the process, he learns that in the 450 years since Connor and Kell's encounter in Glenfinnan, Kell has taken more than 600 heads and gained enough power to be called nothing less than the most powerful immortal alive. To make things worse, neither Connor nor Duncan are strong enough to face Kell alone.—Hammer2Fall On his way home, Conner bears witness to his apartment exploding in an elaborate set up, killing his adopted daughter in the blast. Filled with remorse and loss of hope, Conner goes to a sanctuary in a monastery where he and other immortals are held in a state of hibernation by the monks to avoid the prize from being won. (Even though the prize was one at the end of the first film but, oh well.)While in hibernation, Conner has a memory of how his mother was convicted of witchcraft due to Conner's immortality by the townspeople Conner had been expelled from. Conner set out to rescue her in the ancient village but they were both taken over by the priest and his son, Jacob Kell, Conner's former friend. Conner's mother was tied to a stake and set ablaze while Conner was locked in a prison cell and forced to watch. He did escape his prison and kill many attackers but was unable to save his mother. He then killed the priest believing the priest to be attacking him, and was then attacked by Kell, who he mortally wounded- thus making him an immortal inadvertently. Conner mourned the death of his mother and returned home.With the flashback over, the monastery is laid siege to by a group of immortal bikers. The monk guardians are all killed, and the bikers' leader, Jacob Kell, arrives and makes his way into the sanctuary. One by one, he decapitates all the sleeping immortals, making his way to Conner who has begun to awaken and is trying to escape...Before we can learn of Conner's fate, we are then introduced to Duncan MacLeod, Conner's relative who is disturbed by a vision of killing during his training. He then goes to visit his friend, fellow immortal, Methos, who tells him of the Sanctuary. Duncan is in disbelief that Conner would ever desire to go there, but Methos concludes that Conner would do so as to protect the last living members of the people he loved. After the bloody sanctuary aftermath, Guardian Matthew Hale, observes the bloodshed and tells his men that they will now seek out ""volunteers"" to avoid the battle from continuing and the prize from being won.Duncan then has a memory of his adventures with Conner in Kildare Ireland in 1712, and how they rescued a beautiful lady named Kate from being waylaid by Highwaymen. Duncan later married Kate, and Conner arrived to tell him that Kate had the opportunity to become an immortal if killed suddenly. Of two minds about the issue, Duncan is unsure as to what to do of the matter. Conner encourages him to let Kate go, but Duncan is unable to. In a fit of impulse he kills Kate suddenly, only for her to awaken and scream in horror at what her husband is done. She flees his life and does not return.Duncan then travels to Conner's abandoned wreck of a home and is attacked by Kate who is still angry at Duncan for making her an immortal. After a battle with more immortals who attack, Kell arrives. However, before anything else can continue, Duncan is shot many times by an impatient immortal and falls out of a window where he is collected by Hale's men. The impatient immortal is executed by Kell for his actions in allowing Duncan to escape. Duncan finds himself being strapped to a hibernation device by Hale, but is unable to escape. Hale leaves and Duncan is taken over by sleep after Hale injects him with a drug. While out, Duncan has a memory of the time Conner appeared to him the moment Duncan became an immortal after a swift death in a battle. Duncan awakens to find himself being rescued by watcher Joe Dawson and Methos. They travel to a graveyard where Duncan enters alone and finds Conner, who tells him that Kell had the opportunity to kill him in the sanctuary but let him live in order to continue terrorizing him. Kell and Kate arrive. Kell taunts Conner, explaining that it has been him all along who has been killing everyone Conner loves in recompense for Conner killing his father the priest.Kell challenges Conner to a fight where they stand, and Conner accepts despite Duncan reminding him that it is against the Immortal's code of honor to fight on holy ground. The battle is very short and one-sided as Kell easily overpowers Conner and beats him to the ground, continuously taunting him, before leaving with Kate. Duncan offers to help Conner but Conner leaves in a huff, knowing that Kell will try to kill Duncan in order to make Conner';s life more miserable. That night, Duncan tracks down Kate in her modeling career and asks her why she is working with Kell. She explains that she only feels hate towards Duncan and sees that parallel with Kell in his hatred for Conner. However, after Duncan goes home and tries to sleep, Kate follows behind and enters his home. Despite initially fearing that she is there to kill him, Duncan then realizes that Kate is not here for that reason. The two then have passionate sex, paralleling the erotic experience they shared on their wedding night decades earlier. Afterwards, Kate's ill feelings toward Duncan return and she storms out of his home, only for her to track her down and tell her that it is not too late for forgiveness.Kate arrives back at Kell's lair where she and the other immortals realize that Kell will soon kill them and take their quickening when he no longer needs their services. Soon after, Kell gathers them all together in a mock representation of the last supper and decapitates them all one by one, finishing with Kate. Duncan has a vision of Kate's death and is struck with grief. He is then confronted by Conner on a nearby rooftop, who explains that Kell will not stop until both of them are dead, and that together, neither of them will beat Kell, and one must kill the other. Duncan refuses, prompting Conner to attack him. The two battle with swords all the while Duncan begging Conner not to continue. Conner then locks Duncan into a sword move to which Duncan is invincible against his opponent. Seeing what is conspiring, Duncan begs Conner not to continue, only to be met with Conner's last signs of humanity and love. Duncan tearfully tells Conner that he loves him and Conner smiles sadly, nodding in agreement. Duncan wrests his sword free from Conner's grip and swiftly decapitates him, killing Conner once and for all. Duncan then receives Conner's quickening and is overcome with emotion with the memories he sees of Conner's past lives.Duncan, strengthened with Conner's quickening, goes after Kell and the two do battle in an abandoned power plant. Kell beats Duncan around and comes close to killing him but hesitates in order to taunt him further. Duncan then tries his invincible move upon Kell but Kell deflects his move with a hidden dagger, and beats him down once more. However, Duncan's voice alters to that of Conner's as does his face which distracts Kell. Duncan then leaps over Kell and decapitates him in one bold stroke of his sword, before kicking his body off of the parapet and into a pool stating defiantly (in Conner's voice) ""There can be only one, and you are not it!""Duncan is struck with Kell's overwhelmingly powerful quickening and is overcome with power and might. He collapses, spent to his knees, before making his way up as the victor, having finally gained the prize. He then visits Conner's grave, for which is in Scotland and tearfully pays his respect to Conner's memory saying, ""I hope you've found peace, Conner."""
Ready to Rumble,2000,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0217756/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Two slacker wrestling fans are devastated by the ousting of their favorite character by an unscrupulous promoter. Two dimwit sewage workers watch their hero, WCW wrestler Jimmy King, get screwed out of the World title by wrestler Diamond Dallas Page and evil WCW owner Titus Sinclair. They embark on a quest to help their hero win his title - and honor - back. Features cameos by lots of WCW wrestlers.—Greg Popil Gordie Boggs and Sean Dawkins are two dumb hardcore wrestling fans who worship WCW's World Champion, Jimmy King. When they attend an episode of WCW Nitro to see King defend the title from Diamond Dallas Page, they witness him losing in a dishonest effort and being fired by the president, Titus Sinclair. After their truck breaks down on their way home, the guys figure it must be a test to find King and avenge his unfair loss and firing. They find him and persuade him to go back to WCW and get the title back. King shows up on Nitro with Gordie and Sean, and King pins Page after all hell breaks loose. This causes Sinclair to strike up a deal: if King defeats Page at the next pay-per-view, he gets his title back plus $1 million; if he loses, he is never allowed back in WCW. So Gordie and Sean take King back to basics, and rebuild him to win the WCW World Heavyweight Championship once and for all.—powermandan Sewage workers Gordie Boggs (David Arquette) and Sean Dawkins (Scott Caan) are huge professional wrestling fans. They seem to know a lot about it and its history except for the fact that it's purely entertainment and that it's scripted. Their favorite wrestler is World Championship Wrestling (WCW)'s World Heavyweight Champion Jimmy King (Oliver Platt) who personifies a modern king character on TV. Unbeknownst to them, King is actually a low life wrestler who burned out his fortune and didn't show a much respect for his boss, his family, or his co-workers.WCW owner and promoter Titus Sinclair (Joe Pantoliano), fed-up with King's attitude and behaviors, puts up a plan to screw King out of his title and destroy him. To do so, he hires WCW wrestler Diamond Dallas Page (DDP) (Himself) and his crew. He books a match between King and DDP and keeps everyone backstage thinking that King is gonna win.So Sean and Gordie go to the WCW Monday Nitro show as fans, believing they're about to witness another King victory. What ensues is their favorite wrestler getting beat up for real in the ring, loosing his championship belt and getting publicly fired from WCW for life. After the match, on their way home, the two wrestling fans express their disappointment and rage in their septic truck which leads to a car crash.However, Gordie believes that the car crash was fate and that they should help make Jimmy King World Champion again. Sean agrees to help Gordie, and the dimwitted duo embarks on a journey to put their King back on his throne.The next day, they meet Isaac (Chris Owen), a nerdy wrestling fan who's father seems to think everything Issac does is for pussies. They asks their new friend to use his internet knowledge to find out where the washed-up wrestler lives. Isaac succeeds to find King's address, and the boys go to an unexpected-looking neighborhood. They find King's estranged wife Eugenia (Caroline Rhea) and his uneducated son Frankie (Tait Smith) who both happens to be the exact opposite of what you'd expect from a queen and prince. Eugenia reveals that King left them a while ago to run with another girl and never returned nor sent anything for child support. They later meet his parents (Kathleen Freeman and Lewis Arquette), who reveals that their son borrowed their mobile home, and never returned it.The duo finally find King, with the help of Isaac, hiding in a trailer park, drunk and disguised as a woman, afraid that Sinclair and his goons might be looking to inflict more pain upon him. After paying King 30$ for a 5 minute encounter, they have a conversation in which King claims he's officially retired and has given up on wrestling. Refusing to drop the subject, Gordie and Sean, with their stupidity, anger King to the point where he suddenly attacks the two boys. The boys encourage King to beat them up in order to convince him that he can still fight and that he should fight DDP again. King accepts the offer and knocks out the boys with his finishing move to thank them. The two boys awake the next day to find a somewhat sober Jimmy King ready to take one more shot at wrestling.While on the road to the WCW arena, Gordie sends letters to his father, an overzealous cop who wanted Gordie to follow in his footsteps to be a policeman and who hates wrestling because he deems it unmanly and fake. Gordie tells his father that he will not be taking the police test, making him angry to the point where he shoots the letter with his gun.They arrive at the WCW arena where they hide King in a port-a-potty and meet their favorite Nitro Girl, Sasha (Rose McGowan). When DDP shoots a backstage promo mocking Jimmy King on camera, King comes out of the port-a-potty and assaults him. King then asks for a rematch which Sinclair agrees with a few conditions. The match will be a triple cage match (a match involving three cages stacked on one another with a championship title belt hanging above the third cage; whoever can grab it wins) for the WCW World Heavyweight Championship between DDP and King. If King wins, he not only regains his title and the right to resume his career, but he also gets a million dollar bonus cash prize. However, if King loses, he has to officially retire and never wrestle again in WCW or anywhere else. Gordie and Sean agrees with the terms, not listening to King's protest.Later that night, during an after show party, Gordie strikes a conversation with Sasha who flirts with him saying she is impressed with what he's doing for King. She then invites him to a date at her apartment where she ignores his clumsiness and has sex with him.Meanwhile, King, out of sheer panic, tries to run away but falls into a sewer. The boys find him the next morning and convince him they found the perfect trainer for him. They go to Sal Bandini (Martin Landau), an old school trainer who likes to train his students by beating them up and putting them through excruciating submission holds (a parody of real life Canadian wrestling legend and promoter Stu Hart). Sal agrees to train King and therefore starts beating him up. The boys also think that King should have a partner to back him up in case Sinclair tries to interfere with the match. They turn to King's former tag team partner, WCW wrestler Bill Goldberg (Himself). Unfortunately, Goldberg is still resentful of King's behavior towards him and refuses to help.That night, Sal is assaulted and injured by WCW wrestlers Sid Vicious and Perry Saturn. While at the hospital to check on Sal, Gordie overhears a phone conversation between Sasha and Sinclaire and finds out Sasha was faking their relationship to spy on them. He then confronts her and breaks up with her.Sal encourages King to still go through with the match but advises them to hide until then. Gordie and Sean decide to bring King to their hometown of Lusk, Wyoming. On the way, King goes to his wife to apologies for his behaviors and promises, after receiving two kicks to the groin, to use the million dollar cash prize to make it up to her and their son.Upon their arrival, Gordie's father comes along to pick up his son and convinces him that his dreams of getting involved in the professional wrestling business are stupid. That night, Sean and King try to bust Gordie out of his room where he's been confined to study until the next police exam, but Gordie refuses, saying it's time he gets real with his life.King and Sean holds an audition to find an entourage to help King during the match since no one within the WCW locker room wants to back him up. Many candidates show up, but none of them are any good and King realizes he's gonna have to do it on his own. As they are about to leave for the show, Gordie comes to say goodbye and apologies to King for not going with them. King dismisses the apology because he understands and thanks Gordie for everything he's done for him.Meanwhile, Sean meets up with Wendy (Melanie Deanne Moore) whom he first thought of as one of the guys but realized he has developed a soft spot for her while she was always infatuated with him. He gives her a New-York Hard Rock Cafe T-shirt and confesses that he's been thinking about her. She thanks him by bringing him inside the RV and have sex with him before he leaves.The night of the match, King is ready but very nervous. He's joined by Sean, dressed to impress as he's going to act as a manager to King from outside the cages. Both King and DDP makes their entrance and the match gets underway. The fight quickly becomes a nightmare for King when it is revealed that DDP's goons were hiding under the ring and therefore, are inside the cage with them. One of the goons is a masked wrestler who turns out to be King's son Frankie who does not hesitate to attack his father. As King is getting beat up by the goons, out comes WCW wrestlers Goldberg, Booker T, Billy Kidman and Disco Inferno who have finally decided to help King after all. Unfortunately, they can't do much as they're all locked out of the cage.It is then that another man riding a motorcycle comes out and uses the entrance ramp as a jumping board to crash through the cage door and take out some of the goons with the motorcycle. That man is Gordie, dressed in a wrestling outfit inspired by his father's uniform. His father sees his son on TV and starts cheering him on with is colleagues. Gordie and the others deal with DDP's friends and defeat them while King and DDP climb the cages to get to the belt. Sasha tries to get back together with Gordie as the fans seem to love him, but gets knocked out by a ladder after not listening to Sean's warnings.Meanwhile, in the highest cage, DDP manages to throw King down to the lowest cage. As he attempts to reach for the belt, Page is knocked down to the lowest cage himself by WCW wrestler Sting (himself) who was threatened into helping DDP earlier by Sinclaire but decided to help King instead because he actually likes him. King and DDP both succeed to climb back to the top again and fight it out until King manages to slam DDP all the way down to the mat, knocking him out in the process. King retrieves the belt and is once again the WCW World Heavyweight Champion.After the match, Sean and Gordie beat up Sinclaire before tossing him into the crowd where the fans beat him up some more. Goldberg asks King to reform their tag team but the new champ announces his new partner will be Gordie and their manager will be Sean. Gordie's father still cheering finally accepts his son's decision while Wendy is seen at work jumping and screaming her love for Sean.Afterwards, Sean is back in Lusk, at the convenient store where the story began, telling the story to some kids and saying ""dreams can come true"".

Saving Grace,2000,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0195234/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A small-town English widow, facing financial troubles after her husband's suicide, turns to agriculture of an illegal kind. A widow discovers after her husband's suicide that he has mortgaged everything they own and the banks are ready to foreclose. Faced with impending doom and little working knowledge except her ability to grow plants, she struggles to save her home. Enter her gardener, who is struggling to make a few marijuana plants grow in a hidden location and suggests that she use her green house to help grow the plants and sell them to make the money both need. He is wanting to get married, but needs capital. What he doesn't know is that his girl friend is pregnant and thus fears that they will be busted for growing marijuana. While supposedly working, the whole village is well aware of the endeavor and is hoping for their success. When the plants come in, Grace takes the crop to London and tries to sell it to a ruthless, but charming drug dealer. Everything busts loose from there.—John Sacksteder <jsackste@bellsouth.net> Grace has just lost her husband, which is sad enough, but she's also discovered that he's left her in debt to the tune of thousands of pounds. Faced with losing all of her belonging and her home, Grace turns to the only thing she's got left: her skill as a greenhouse gardener. She and her handyman Matthew hatch a brilliant marijuana-growing scheme. But are they doing the right thing? Can Matthew's girlfriend put up with these kind of illegal antics? And finally, once they grow it, can they even manage to sell the stuff?—Martin Lewison <mlewison@utk.edu> A wealthy widow discovers that she is not wealthy at all: in fact she is 300,000 British pounds in debt, thanks to her late husband's failed business ventures. To get her out of debt, her handyman comes up with a plan to grow a certain cash crop in her greenhouse.—Tim Horrigan <horrigan@aol.com> The first scene shows Matthew Stewart digging a grave for Grace Trevethyn's husband, John (Bill Weston), who has committed suicide. His now widow, Grace (Brenda Blethyn), an English woman living on a beautiful large estate, learns, upon his death, that John's debts had mounted to the point that her assets (home, car, garden) will soon be repossessed. The postman (Bill Hallet) keeps on bringing her more threatening letters from banks, credit cards... and he also tells all the townspeople about her problems. One of John and Grace's friends, Dr. Martin Bamford (Martin Clunes) tells her that everybody knew more or less that John was doing something fishy financially, but nobody wanted to interfere in his business. With desperation, Grace realises that all commercial schemes by her late husband were failures, and that they even had a secret account in Sweden, but with nothing in it.With no assets of note and no source of income, she watches helplessly as the process begins, and when her high-tech state-of-the-art lawnmower is taken away by some movers (led by Johnny Bamford), she must fire her gardener, Matthew Stewart (Craig Ferguson), to whom she is close. When she stumbles upon the fact that Matthew is not having much success growing some weed plants in the fields of the local vicarage because of the lack of sunlight and heat, feeling awful about having fired him, she suggests that he move his plants to her greenhouse.The plants begin to grow impressively, and Grace, quite innocently, asks Matthew what the plants are worth. The news that they are illegal marijuana plants that are quite valuable on the open market gives Grace an idea, one that might just save her from having her estate repossessed by the bank. Mass production of marijuana plants begins in Grace's greenhouse. Matthew's girlfriend, hard-working fishing boat captain Nicky Tristan (Valerie Edmond) wants no part of the plan. She wants Matthew to grow up, settle down and start taking responsibility for his own life. Some of the locals suspect what is going on, but, compassionately, stay out of Grace's way. In fact, some of them have the notion of watching the neon lights coming from the conservatory every night, as though it was some kind of show.Of course, somebody will have to go to London to line up a buyer for the marijuana. Matthew, a marijuana user and a man in his thirties is the logical candidate, but unbeknownst to him, his girlfriend is pregnant. Knowing of the pregnancy, and not wanting Matthew to leave the side of his girl, Grace insists that she be the one to go to London. Her escapade into the lowest depths of the London drug subculture is hilarious, and at first it looks like she is going to fail. However, suave and savvy Jacques Chevalier (Tchéky Karyo, more handsome than ever) eventually contacts her. He smooth-talks her into doing business.Authorities become aware of the drugs on her estate because of the flying saucer-like lights which the greenhouse now emits. Local police officer Sgt. Alfred Mabely (Ken Campbell) has let things be, as he thought she was cultivating just a small quanitity of weed for her own personal use and that she needed it to cope with all the debts and stress. But when he realises that it's a huge quantity, he has to get involved and investigate the matter.Grace has little choice but to destroy her own inventory. However, as the marijuana plants are not completely dry, they produce such a huge quantity of smoke that Grace, Matthew, the posh visiting ladies (Phillida Law, Linda Kerr Scott, Denise Coffey) who didn't wait for Grace to appear to make themselves some tea, and even the police officers -including Mabely - get high. The scene leaves with everybody jumping, dancing and caressing happily in the garden while naked.In a strange twist of fate, however, Grace writes a book describing her remarkable experience called The Joint Venture. The novel becomes a best seller, and, suddenly, her financial worries are over. She has to travel again to London to receive an award won by her novel, while all the townsfolk look at her on TV. Now we come to realise that Grace and Jacques are a couple, that he has left London for her small town and he strongly denies to some journalists that he ever got involved with any kind of drug."

Annie is unable to produce a vision, largely due to the presence of Sheriff Pearl Johnson (J. K. Simmons), who looks upon Annie's trade unfavorably.Annie later receives a vision that Jessica has been murdered and her body weighed down by a chain and thrown into a pond. She also sees a fiddle player, white lilies, and a split-rail fence. She goes to Sherrif Johnson with her findings, and with the information, Johnson decides to search a pond on the property of violent alcoholic Donnie Barksdale (Keanu Reeves), whose battered wife, Valerie (Hilary Swank), gives permission to search their house as Donnie is away fishing. Donnie returns while the search is proceeding. As the police are ready to give up on the search, they find the naked and chained body of Jessica King. Donnie is immediately arrested.During his trial for Jessica's murder, it is revealed that Jessica and Barksdale had an affair, and Jessica's reputation for promiscuity is exposed in court. The case against Barksdale is strengthened when a scratch on his forearm is proven to have been perpetrated by Jessica during a confrontation at a local bar.

Buddy tries to explain to Annie why he hates his father, but Annie is preoccupied and doesn't want to listen to the panicky and vulgar Buddy. He asks her, ""If I look into a blue diamond, will I die?"" but doesn't elaborate. Unable to understand the question, Annie shrugs Buddy off.Soon after, Buddy's hysterical mother calls Annie to come over, as Buddy has snapped and has his father bound to a chair. Buddy sets fire to his father, and as Annie tries to stop him, he shows her a blue diamond tattoo on his father's navel. It is revealed that Buddy's father took advantage of his son's fragile mental state to force him into fellatio. An ambulance takes Buddy's father away, while Buddy is taken to a psychiatric hospital.Later, Annie receives another vision saying that Donnie is innocent. She asks District Attorney David Duncan (Gary Cole) to reopen the case. Duncan refuses, but Annie counters that she will reveal Duncan's own involvement with Jessica King, as Annie had caught them making out in the women's restroom at a local dance. Duncan offers her money to keep quiet, but Annie refuses, still wanting justice for Barksdale.Annie tells Principal Collins that Barksdale is not responsible for his fiancée's death and that D.A. Duncan will not reopen the investigation. After driving out to the pond that night with Collins, Annie realizes that Collins is the murderer. He confesses to Annie that he was angry after he discovered that she was cheating on him with nearly every man in town. Knowing that she'll go to the police, Collins attempts to kill Annie. Just as he is about to land a fatal blow with a steel flashlight, Buddy Cole shows up and knocks Collins out.Sitting in the car at the pond, Buddy, uncharacteristically calm, returns a handkerchief that Annie had loaned him earlier, and tells her that she is the heart and soul of the town and not to stop doing what she's doing. The two drive to the police station with Collins stowed in the trunk. Annie tells Buddy that he will have to return to the hospital, and he waits in the car while she goes inside to talk with Sheriff Johnson. When Annie explains to Johnson what happened at the pond and that Buddy saved her life, the sheriff informs her that Buddy Cole had hanged himself at the hospital earlier that day. She returns to her car to find Buddy gone. However, Annie still has her handkerchief that Buddy's ghost returned to her."

Digimon: The Movie,2000,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0259974/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Throughout three different stories, Kari Kamiya and her friends take on explosive adventures involving digital creatures. The film is an edited version of three different Japanese short films, which have been combined together. There is narration by a continuing character, Kari. The first segment of the film revolves around the first encounter with a digimon and a fight that occurs between their digimon and another. The two kids, Kari and Tai, raise a fast-growing digimon from an egg to a large, dinosaur-like digimon, which escapes from their house and then has an encounter and a battle with a parrot-like digimon. The second segment mainly involves Tai and another digiDestined friend of his, Izzy. A computer virus sweeps across the internet, effecting a digiEgg, and thus creating an infected digimon. This infected digimon begins to start eating computer information and data, and the two protagonists attempt to stop the digimon, but fail. After the infected digimon manages to get into the American information system and launch two nukes, one at japan and one at Colorado, Tai and Izzy get help from teammates Matt and his little brother T.K. They successfully overcome the infected digimon and prevent the nukes from detonating. The third and final segment involves Kari and T.K., now years older, as they see a kid and two digimon fighting whilst in New York. Kari and T.K decide to follow the child, who turns out to be the creator of the virus, and, after meeting up with friends, they manage to defeat the evil digimon, who turns out to be one of Willis' twin digimon that was affected by the virus following the actions of the second segment. Together they fight against this infected digimon, and destroy the virus that was affecting Willis' digimon.—Leo The film is split into three acts, and narrated by one of the protagonists Kari Kamiya who has a role in the first and third act of the film. Kari gives a brief introduction to the world of Digimon, explaining the existence of Digimon, monsters that were created from computer data, and live in another dimension called the Digital World. She continues, explaining she is part of a team called the Digidestined, who are partnered with Digimon to protect the world from evil. There were only a small handful of members at first, but it is added a few members introducing a new character for the film, named Willis, who lives in Colorado. Willis has two twin Digimon named Gummymon and Kokomon, but had no other friends to rely on. This takes us into the first act, on the night in 1995 when Kari and her big brother Tai encountered their first Digimon. Kari also reveals that Willis met his Digimon on the same night.In Highton View Terrace, Tokyo, Japan, Tai awakens in the night and finds Kari observing their fathers computer, where a large Digiegg emerges. The next day, Tai and Kari witness the egg hatch into Botamon, who quickly bonds with Kari. Tai goes to answer the telephone but the call is interrupted. Returning to the bedroom, Tai discovers Botamon has transformed into Koromon, a pink ball-like Digimon resembling a space hopper. This is a process Kari later explains as digivolving, which allows a Digimon to turn into a stronger form, which affects electrical equipment. Kari steals food from the family cat Miko, causing her to attack and scratch both Tai and Koromon. At sunset, Tai and Kari discover Koromon can speak, and he calls them his best friends.That night, another electrical surge causes Koromon to digivolve into Agumon, an enormous but simple-minded dinosaur, who leaps out the window with Kari on his back. Tai pursues them into the night as Agumon wanders the street, scaring Kari when he starts blowing things up with fireballs. A second, enormous Digiegg appears in the sky, hatching to unleash Parrotmon, a large bird-like Digimon able to fire electrical blasts. As Tai reaches Kari, Parrotmon destroys an overpass, burying Agumon under rubble. However, Agumon digivolves into Greymon and battles Parrotmon. Parrotmon knocks Greymon out, but Tai uses Karis whistle to awaken him. Greymon leaps up and obliterates Parrotmon with a fire blast, but the attack destroys him in the process.In narration, Kari explains that she, Tai, and six other children were amongst those who witnessed the battle and were chosen to become the Digidestined. Karis narration about the team acts as a segway into the second act, set in 2000, a year after the events of the television series Digimon Adventure.Koushiro Izzy Izumi, a computer whiz and member of Digidestined, spots a computer virus has somehow appeared on the internet and is attacking something. Getting an image of its target, Izzy amongst thousands of others across the world, witness the virus mutate a Digiegg, causing it to hatch and become a Digimon, which addresses the world with Hello!. Across town, Tai tries to compose an apology letter to his friend Sora Takenouchi after they had a falling out, but he has difficulty deciding whether or not to end the e-mail with love or from. Kari appears, off to a birthday party, sending the e-mail to Sora behind Tais back, but Tai discovers the e-mail was not delivered.A montage follows, showing what the eight Digidestined are up to Sora wanders the streets and checks her hair in a shop window but fails to notice the virus Digimon on a large screen, Joe Kido, the oldest of the group and voice of reason misses a train to an exam for summer school, Matt Ishida and his little brother T.K. are visiting their grandmother in the countryside, Kari attends a friends birthday, and Izzy races for Tais apartment.

Izzy appears, informing Tai of the Digimon on the internet.In Tais bedroom, they examine the Digimon. Izzy informs Tai that if the Digimon stays online, it could wipe out all technology. Izzy reveals he got his information from Willis, who is actually a child prodigy and taking classes at college already, though Tai is unimpressed. The Digimon suddenly digivolves, now resembling a cycloptic clawed hand and it starts devouring computer data, causing prices at supermarkets to triple, causing chaos at registers. Tai and Izzy race for the Kamiya computer, with Izzy trying one of Mrs. Kamiyas beef jerky milkshakes. Izzy connects his laptop and the computer together for more power, and explains Willis attempted to get his internet provider to remove the Digimon, but they ignored the threat. Getting online, they discover the Digimon has evolved again, now the creepy-looking Keramon. Not knowing what to do, Tai states he wish his partner Agumon was there (a different character from the Agumon seen in the first act).Agumon suddenly contacts Tai through Izzys laptop, revealing he and the other partners of the Digidestined are aware of Keramon. The Digimon are joined by Gennai, a data entity who appears as an old man. Agumon and Izzys partner, the insectoid Tentomon, agree to go onto the internet to delete Keramon whilst Tai decides to telephone the other Digidestined so their partners can help too. The attempts to phone his friends doesnt go well Joe is too busy to attend (seeing racing into his exam), Matt and T.K.s grandma is too senile to give the phone to them, Mimi is away from home and Tai only gets her answer machine, Kari is unable to come home, and Tai forces Izzy to call Sora due to their issues. Izzy calls Soras house, but she refuses to talk to Tai. Izzy tells Tai and he angrily rants about her attitude, revealing their falling out happened over a lousy hairclip. Sora checks her e-mail to see if Tai sent her anything but finds nothing.Agumon and Tentomon arrive on the internet and find Keramon eating computer data. They attack him, but when Keramon threatens Tai and Izzy, the two digivolve into their Champion-level forms Greymon and Kabuterimon. Keramon suddenly digivolves into Infermon, an armoured spider-like Digimon that proves to be stronger than Greymon and Kabuterimon. Izzy realises he is skipping stages in the digivolution chain and is now on the Ultimate-level. Greymon and Kabuterimon try to do likewise, but Infermon attacks them mid-transformation, wounding both and turning them back into Agumon and Tentomon.Izzy starts receiving e-mails from around the world, including one from Willis who claims the whole thing is his fault and suggests that Tai and Izzy find a way to slow down Infermon. Infermon himself sends an e-mail, which only says Hello repeatedly. Izzy spots the address, realising Infermon is hacking into the phone company and could cause them to lose their internet connection. Tai tries to call his friends but finds the circuits are busy, enraging the phone operator with his constant calls. Infermon calls and asks if Tai is his creator. Kari explains that Infermon was calling every number in the world, looking for his programmer. Izzys internet connection is cut off, forcing him to run home and fetch something, while Tai collapses on the sofa in defeat.A news reporter announces an emergency voicemailing system issued by the government to use the phone, instructing people to leave a message than call back to pick up replies. Tai sends messages to Matt and T.K., Kari, and Sora, inviting her to come to his house so they can talk about their issues. Sora arrives but hesitates at the last minute and stomps away. Tai leaves a message for Mimi, but his mother reveals they got a postcard from Mimi, who is on vacation in Hawaii cut to an ecstatic Mimi in Hawaii who doesnt have a care in the world. Izzy returns and reveals to Tai he has a satellite uplink device which will let them hack into a military satellite system to regain internet access.Tai checks the phone messages, discovering Matt and T.K. have left messages. Tai informs them of the situation, so Matt and T.K. rush off into town to find a computer to use. Tai and Izzy go back online and find Infermon has gone, now causing havoc in New York City. Matt and T.K. contact Tai and Izzy via a webcam, revealing they are using a computer in a barber shop, where a group of eccentric patrons watch their endeavours. Agumon and Tentomon are deployed to battle Infermon again, but are join by Matt and T.K.s partners Gabumon and Patamon. Confronting Infermon, Agumon and Gabumon immediately digivolve to their Mega-level forms WarGreymon and MetalGarurumon.The two beat Infermon down, and Patamon tries to digivolve as well. Infermon suddenly dashes at him, digivolving into his Mega-level form Diaboromon. Diaboromon uses his extendable arms to knock out Patamon and pin Tentomon down. WarGreymon and MetalGarurumon battle Diaboromon, getting the advantage. However, Izzy suddenly gets severe cramps and runs for the bathroom, blaming Mrs. Kamiyas recipes. Matt informs Tai that the Digimon are slowing down for some reason. Tai angrily slams the computer, causing it to malfunction, and WarGreymon freezes in place. Izzy returns and has to reboot the computer. He and Tai argue but then the subject turns to Sora. Tai explains he bought Sora a hairpin for her birthday, but she took offence, believing Tai disliked her hairstyle and they fell out. Izzy is stunned by the silly reason, but the attention is drawn back to the computer, discovering WarGreymon and MetalGarurumon have been defeated.Diaboromon sends an e-mail to Izzy, asking Who can count backwards from ten?. The Digidestined witness Diaboromon create a countdown, and then he starts cloning himself. Izzy is informed by Willis that the American governments systems have been hacked and Diaboromon has fired two nuclear missiles, possibly through Izzys satellite uplink, and they will hit their targets in ten minutes, thus explaining the countdown. The two targets are Colorado and Tais neighbourhood. Izzy explains every other country is trying to intercept the nukes, but their own missiles are made useless by Diaboromon and crash in the ocean near Hawaii.Izzy concludes that if they destroy all of the Diaboromon clones until the original one remains, then they can stop the countdown, only to discover there are over 75,000 clones and rising. WarGreymon and MetalGarurumon decide to go after Diaboromon, and Izzy realises the e-mails he is getting are slowing down their Digimon. The Digimon race to stop Diaboromon, entering a large circular chamber where Diaboromons clones swarm. They all attack at once, easily overwhelming WarGreymon and MetalGarurumon. Both are rendered unconscious. Tai despairs and moves towards the computer, wanting to help WarGreymon. Mrs. Kamiya enters offering more juice but notices Tai has disappeared. Kari explains that Tais bond with WarGreymon was so strong, it allows him to enter the internet and become digital, the same happening to Matt.Tai speaks to WarGreymon, encouraging him to not give up and people from all over the world are supporting him. WarGreymon and MetalGarurumon awaken, harnessing the data from the e-mails, and fuse together into one Digimon Omnimon. Omnimon easily wipes out all of the Diaboromon clones, leaving only the original, but he is so fast that Omnimon doesnt have time to aim at him. With only thirty seconds left, Izzy realises he can send the e-mails to Diaboromons address, slowing him down like they did to their Digimon. Diaboromon slows down, allowing Omnimon to spot him.Ten seconds left, the missiles head for their targets, while Omnimon dashes at Diaboromon, running him through with his sword with only two seconds to go. Diaboromon is deleted, and the missiles land harmlessly, one crashing into Tokyo Bay without detonating. Mrs. Kamiyas cake is charred in the microwave, and Sora finally receives Tais e-mail, noting the love at the end, and makes amends with him. Elsewhere in Colorado, Willis celebrates with his Digimon, only for a strange phenomenon to appear and capture Kokomon.The films third act takes place four years later, with the introduction of the second generation of Digidestined introduced in the series Digimon Adventure 02. T.K. and Kari are in New York with the intent on visiting Mimi, but Kari senses a strange feeling in the air. Nearby, the teenage Willis flees from Kokomon, who has digivolved into an enormous ape-like Digimon (actually called Wendigomon, but he is only called Kokomon throughout the film). Kokomon cryptically informs Willis to go back and to destroy. Gummymon has digivolved into Terriermon, a floppy-earred Digimon who looks more like a rabbit than a dog. Kokomon and Terriermon fight in the back alleys of Manhattan, until Kokomon defeats his smaller twin.Willis tries to get more information from Kokomon, but he disappears into mist. Kari, T.K., Gatomon and Patamon witness the battle but Willis flees when they call out to him. Patamon follows Willis, witnessing him call his mother at a payphone and learns he is going to Colorado. The Digidestined head to Colorado on the train, Kari deciding to contact their friends for backup. On a beach, Davis Motomiya, Yolei Inoue, and Cody Hida, along with their partners, DemiVeemon, Poromon, and Upamon, learn of the situation but are hapless on how to get to America. T.K. and Karis train is suddenly attacked by Kokomon who causes the train to halt in the middle of nowhere, warning them not to interfere.Meanwhile, the others arrive in America and get across country by hitching rides with Yoleis large number of uncles who happen to live in the United States including a reckless cab driver, and a pilot who drops them off in a delivery plane. Davis eventually gets fed up with the travel and shouts, alerting a truck driver who pulls over, and the group hitch a ride on the truck. Inside the trailer, they meet Willis and Terriermon. A little later, the group accompanied by Willis and Terriermon, stand on the roadside. Willis is thrilled to meet other people with Digimon and flirts with Yolei. Davis is impatient to reach Kari, and Willis suggests waiting for them at his summer home in Colorado, calling a pizza delivery guy he knows to pick them up. The delivery man arrives moments later, but he drives off before Davis and Willis can get on.Kokomon materialises, Davis sending DemiVeemon to attack him by digivolving into Veemon. Veemon, Davis, and Terriermon try to fend off Kokomon by flying at him, but crash into a billboard. Veemon digivolves into Flamedramon, but Kokomon easily defeats him. Willis tries to reason with Kokomon, who tells him to go back to the beginning. Willis Digivice, which can be used to help a Digimon digivolve, springs to life, allowing Terriermon to digivolve into Gargomon, a large rabbit who has gun turrets attached to his arms. Gargomon battles Kokomon and defeats him, but he disappears. Willis worries that Kokomon will hurt Davis and the others, but Terriermon tells him that they are a team.Needing transport to reach Yolei and Cody, Veemon digivolves into Raidramon, and they race across Colorado to Willis summer house. Realising T.K. and Kari havent arrived yet, Willis guesses Kokomon likely stalled them. Davis, Yolei, and Cody ask Willis how he knows Kokomon, but he gets upset and leaves, followed by Davis. By nightfall, the two have been wandering for hours and Davis asks Willis what he is afraid of. Willis reluctantly explains that after he got Terriermon and Kokomon, he got the idea to try and create his own Digimon on the internet, but it was attacked by a virus and mutated into Diaboromon. But while Diaboromon was destroyed, the virus survived, somehow appeared in the real world and infected Kokomon, turning him into his present self, and he is obsessed with chasing Willis. Willis assumes that Kokomons cryptic words are about going back to where the virus attacked him, but he cant be sure. Davis encourages Willis to join their team, further supported by an eavesdropping Terriermon.The next day, the Digidestined go to the field where Kokomon was infected, and the big ape arrives. Willis asks him what he wants but Kokomon is unable to speak anything other than Destroy! He suddenly digivolves again, becoming Antylamon, a tall rabbit-like Digimon. Veemon, Terriermon, and the evolved Hawkmon and Armadillomon digivolve to battle Antylamon. Gargomon and Flamedramon corner Antylamon, but he sinks beneath the river and disappears. Antylamon digivolves and rises as the nightmarish Cherubimon, who is able to make the Digimon de-digivolve to their Rookie forms. The group try to fight him as they are but are defeated. T.K. and Kari arrive with their digivolved partners, now Angemon and Angewomon, who are able to put up a decent fight against Cherubimon until he covers the whole area in darkness.
All the children suddenly start getting younger, revealing Kokomon is reversing time, and only Veemon, Terriermon, Angemon and Angewomon are spared. Willis realises Kokomons words meant go back in time to when the virus first attacked him four years ago. Angemon and Angewomon decide to digivolve to their Mega-level forms to unlock the Golden Digieggs, which will allow Veemon and Terriermon to digivolve. The two become Seraphimon and Magnadramon, but are quickly defeated by Cherubimon, reverting them back to Patamon and Gatomon. However, their presence summons the Golden Digieggs, Veemon and Terriermon using them to digivolve into Magnamon and Rapidmon.They battle Cherubimon who launches a sneak attack on them, and devours them. Inside Cherubimons body, they find Kokomons soul who implies they must destroy him from the inside out to eliminate the virus. The two fire their attacks and delete the virus, allowing Cherubimon to turn good, but the damage causes him to be deleted as well, though Veemon and Terriermon survive.The Digidestined return to New York, where Davis informs Willis that Digimon never really die but rather their data is rebooted and they are born again. Willis parts ways with the other, cheekily kissing Kari and Yolei on the way out, much to Davis fury. He and Terriermon return to Colorado, where Willis calls his mother. Terriermon senses a Digiegg, and Kokomons egg washes up nearby. Kari closes the film, explaining that friendships last forever and Digimon will come back, even if they are singing a different tune. Kokomon, now Wendigomon again, sings rather badly to Smash Mouths Allstar, while Willis watches on in amusement, commenting that his friend is tone deaf."

Shadow of the Vampire,2000,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0189998/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The filming ofNosferatu (1922)is hampered by the fact that its starMax Schreckis taking the role of a vampire far more seriously than seems humanly possible. Shadow of the Vampire is a film about the making of a German all time classic silent horror-movie from 1922 called Nosferatu-Eine Symphonie des Grauens (Nosferatu-a Symphony of Horror). The production of Nosferatu had to deal with a lot of strange things (some crew members disappeared, some died). This movie focuses on the difficult relationship between Murnau, the director, and Schreck, the lead actor.—Anonymous Max Schreck's performance in the classic film Nosferatu has become legendary. What if the reason he was so good is that he really was a vampire? That's the premise of this film, which features director F.W. Murnau so enamored with creating the perfect vampire film that he seeks out an actual member of the undead to play the title role. But when Schreck starts taking more and more advantage of the opportunities to feed he suddenly has, can Murnau come to his senses and destroy him?—rmlohner Bram Stoker's widow has refused to sell the film rights for Dracula
to F.W. Murnau, so Murnau [John Malkovich] decides to film it anyway, changing the names of
the characters, the title, and the locations. Thus, Dracula becomes
Nosferatu, Transylvania and England become Germany, Count Dracula
becomes Count Orlock, and Mina becomes Ellen. After filming the beginnings
of the movie on a soundstage in Berlin, Murnau is anxious to get cast and
crew to Czechloslovakia where they will be meeting up with Max Schreck [Willem Dafoe],
the vampire hired by Murnau to play an actor playing a vampire.Murnau introduces Max Schreck as a character actor from the Reinhold
Company and explains that Schreck will remain in character at all times.
Yet no one, not even producer Albin Grau [Udo Kier] knows anything about him. As a
vampire, Schreck is no Dracula. He is old and bald. He can't remember his
humanity; he knows only that his turning had to do with a woman, whose
face has long ago passed from his memory. He has lost most of his powers,
e.g., his strength and his ability to pass through locked doors. He hasn't
seen the light of the sun for centuries. He lives in the filth of an
abandoned abbey, keeping himself alive on the blood of the occasional rat
he can catch. He thinks the saddest part of Dracula, which he read after
Murnau gave him a copy, is when Dracula was forced cook for Harker because
he had no servants. He reads and angsts over Goethe's poem about Tithonus,
a mortal who wished for immortality but forgot to ask for external youth
and is now aged, powerless, and yet must endure...just like himself. He
has agreed to make this film only because Murnau has promised to provide
him with blood during the filming and, at the end of the movie, Murnau has
promised that Schreck can feed on Greta [Catherine McCormack], the actress who is playing Ellen
Harker.As the filming progresses, Schreck's performance is both inspiring
and creepy, inspiring in how he captures the essence of the vampire and
creepy in his own personality and mannerisms. To add to the creepiness,
the local villagers are extremely anxious about the nosferatu,
particularly after photographer Wolfgang Mueller [Ronan Vibert] is found weak and dazed.
While filming the scene where Jonathan Harker cuts his finger with a bread
knife, Schreck loses control and takes more blood from Wolfgang, forcing
Murnau to threaten Schreck with the admonition that he cannot harm his
people or there will be no Greta. Schreck is able to contain himself,
feeding on the blood of ferrets, rats, and bats and on the occasional
bottle of blood that Murnau supplies, but one thing Schreck refuses to do
is to film at sea. Consequently, Murnau is forced to build a replica of
the ship on dry ground for the sailing scenes. However, the final scenes
of the movie, where Orlock feeds from Ellen and is killed in the morning
sunlight, must be shot on the island of Heligoland, so Murnau agrees to
fly Orlock there. Unfortunately, Wolfgang is too far gone and must be
replaced by another photographer, Fritz Wagner [Cary Elwes].By now, Murnau's people are beginning to suspect that Schreck is a
real vampire. All the cast and crew members lock their bedroom doors at
night. Albin and Fritz have gone in search of his coffin but found
nothing. Their suspicions are confirmed when one night they come upon
Murnau in a laudanum stupor. While under the influence, Murnau blurts out
that there is no Max Schreck. He found him in a book about despotic
Slovakian rulers reputed to be vampires and then, while Murnau was
scouting out locations in Czechloslovakia, he came upon him living in the
old monastery. When Fritz asks Murnau what he promised Schreck in return
for acting in his movie, Murnau tells the truth: Greta. Albin and Fritz
are appalled but agree to go ahead that night with the filming of the
final scenes.Murnau has set up the final bedroom scene in an old warehouse that is
light-tight, but he has taken care to install a safeguard...a door to
allow daylight to come streaming into the room at the flick of a switch.
Greta, dressed in a nightgown, is positioned on the bed. Orlock is on the
set, his eyes filled with lust for Greta and following her every move.
Fritz is behind the camera, ready to shoot. Albin is standing by, and
Murnau begins barking out directions.
Just as the camera is about to roll, Greta notices that Schreck casts
no reflection in the mirror next to her bed. She begins to scream, so
Murnau shoots her with laudanum, which knocks her into a compliant stupor.
Schreck is almost beside herself. 'I vant her now,' he hisses, but Murnau
refuses until after he has shot the death scene. When those shots are
completed, Schreck can contain himself no longer and pounces at Greta's
neck. Amazingly, Murnau keeps the film rolling as Schreck drinks and
drinks. After drinking his fill, Schreck falls asleep, as evidenced by his
snores. Murnau, Albin, and Fritz wait.It is daybreak. Hoping to get a more realistic death scene, Murnau
orders that the door be opened to flood the room with sunlight.
Unbeknown to Murnau, however, Schreck has found the trap and dismantled
it. In releasing the lever, the noise awakens Schreck, who becomes irate
at being tricked. Fritz attempts to fire on him, but Schreck is impervious
to bullets and breaks Fritz's neck. Then he chokes Albin. Meanwhile,
Murnau has taken over the camera. He informs Schreck that this ending is
unworkable and requests that he return to his original mark. Amazingly,
Schreck complies, returning to Greta's neck for another sip of blood. Just
then, the outside crew breaks down the door, allowing the sunlight into
the chamber, and Schreck dies again...this time for real.
After ending the shot, Murnau looks up from the camera and says, 'I
think we have it.' [Original Synopsis by bj_kuehl.]"
Quills,2000,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0180073/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"In a Napoleonic era insane asylum, an inmate, the irrepressible Marquis De Sade, fights a battle of wills against a tyrannically prudish doctor. The infamous writer, the Marquis de Sade of eighteenth century France, is imprisoned at Charenton Insane Asylum for unmentionable activities. He manages to befriend the young Abbé de Coulmier, who runs the asylum, along with a beautiful laundress named Madeline. Things go terribly wrong when the Abbe finds out that the Marquis' books are being secretly published. Emperor Napoleon contemplates sending Dr. Royer-Collard to oversee the asylum, a man famed for his torturous punishments. It could mean the end of Charenton and possibly the Marquis.—Emily H and Janette W A notorious French writer writes books about sexual situations. The Marquis de Sade's laundress smuggles his last writings out of the asylum.—Anonymous Quills begins during the Reign of Terror, with the incarcerated Marquis de Sade (Geoffrey Rush) penning a story about the libidinous Mademoiselle Renare, an aristocrat who meets the preeminent sadist in her executioner.Several years later with the Marquis confined to the asylum at Charenton, overseen by the enlightened Abbé du Coulmier (Joaquin Phoenix). The Marquis has been publishing his work through laundress Madeleine ""Maddy"" LeClerc (Kate Winslet), who smuggles manuscripts through an anonymous horseman (Tom Ward) to a publisher. The Marquis' latest work, Justine, is published on the black market to great success. Napoleon (Ron Cook) orders all copies of the book burned and the author shot, but his advisor, Delbené (Patrick Malahide), tempers this contentious idea with one of his own: send traditionalist Doctor Royer-Collard (Michael Caine) to look in at Charenton and silence the Marquis.Dr. Royer-Collard arrives, informing the Abbé that the Marquis' ""therapeutic writings"" have been distributed for public consumption. Horrified, the Abbé rejects Royer-Collard's offers of several archaic ""treatments"" and asks to speak with the Marquis himself, who promptly swears obedience (winking at Madeleine through a peephole). Royer-Collard takes his leave for the time being and travels to the Panthemont Convent in Paris to retrieve his promised bride, the underage Simone (Amelia Warner). They are given a run-down chateau by the Emperor, with a handsome young architect, Prouix (Stephen Moyer) on hand for its renovation.The hasty marriage incites much gossip at the asylum, prompting the Marquis to write a farce to be performed at a public exhibition. The audacious play, titled ""The Crimes of Love"", is interrupted when the inmate Bouchon (British character actor Stephen Marcus) molests Madeleine off-stage, prompting her to hit him in the face with an iron. Royer-Collard shuts down the public theater and demands that the Abbé do more to control the Marquis. Infuriated, the Abbé confiscates the Marquis' quills and ink, prompting more subversive behavior, including a story written in wine on bedsheets and in blood on clothing. This results in further deprivation, eventually leaving the Marquis naked in an empty cell.While this is occurring at the asylum, Simone has been violently introduced to the adult world by her husband. She unrepentantly purchases a copy of the Marquis de Sade's Justine, seduces Prioux, and the young lovers run off together. She leaves behind a letter explaining her actions and her copy of Justine. Upon finding this, Dr. Royer-Collard seizes on the Marquis as the source of his troubles and embarks upon a quest for revenge.About to be sent away from Charenton for her role in assisting the Marquis, Madeleine begs a last story from him, which is to be relayed to her through the asylum patients. Bouchon, the inmate at the end of the relay, is excited by the story, breaks out of his cell, and kills Madeleine. The asylum is set afire by the pyromaniac Dauphin (George Yiasoumi) and the inmates break out of their cells.Madeleine's body is found by her blind mother in the laundry vat and Bouchon is captured and imprisoned inside an iron dummy. The Abbé blames the Marquis for Madeleine's death and prods him into a fury. The Marquis claims he had been with Madeleine in every way imaginable, only to be told she had died a virgin. The Abbé cuts out the Marquis' tongue as punishment for his involvement. In a later scene, the Abbe commits necrophilia with the corpse of Madeline in a dream. The Marquis' health declines severely, though perverse as ever, he decorates his oubliette with a story, using feces as ink. As the Abbé finishes reading the last rites, he offers the Marquis a crucifix to kiss, which he swallows and chokes on, thus committing suicide.A year later, the new Abbé du Maupas (Alex Avery) arrives at Charenton and is given the grand tour. The asylum has been converted into a printing press, with the inmates as its staff. The books being printed are the works of the Marquis de Sade. At the end of the tour, the new Abbé meets his predecessor, who resides in the Marquis' old cell. Yearning to write, he begs paper and a quill from the Abbé, who is herded off by Royer-Collard, now overseer of the asylum. However, the peephole opens, and Madeleine's mother thrusts paper, quill, and ink through. The Abbé begins to scribble furiously, with the Marquis providing the narration."

As Sarno begins coordinating the rescue of Robin, Longbaugh contacts Robin's gynecologist, Dr. Allen Painter (Dylan Kussman) and orders him to a truck stop to examine Robin.After the examination, Painter returns to Chidduck, and it is revealed that Dr. Painter is Chidduck's son.Longbaugh calls and demands a $15 million ransom for the safe return of Robin and the baby. Jeffers and Obecks, tempted by the money, begin forming a plan to save the child, keep the $15 million for themselves, and kill everyone under the guise of paying off the kidnappers. As Longbaugh hangs up the telephone outside a Mexican motel, he is approached by Sarno, who offers to pay $1 million if they surrender the pregnant Robin and simply walk away. Sarno reveals to Longbaugh that his daughter has something in the works, promising to take care of the old man. Longbaugh declines the offer and returns to his hotel room where Parker and Robin play cards. Sarno then returns to Chidduck's home to relay the events and plan the next step.Jeffers and Obecks realize that Sarno is a wild card in this affair, and Jeffers comes to realize that Robin is Sarno's daughter. Jeffers, Obecks and Painter leave to meet with the kidnappers, while Sarno departs separately with the $15 million ransom. At the motel, Parker is having second thoughts on the kidnapping, he confers with Longbaugh outside the motel room which gives Robin an opportunity to seize a shotgun and barricade herself in the motel room after almost shooting Parker.As sirens are heard in the distance, Parker and Longbaugh hastily escape, and Robin emerges into the parking lot just as Mexican police officers arrive, followed by Jeffers, Obecks and Painter in another car. As Painter and the bodyguards try to persuade Robin to leave with them, the officers pull their guns and order everybody on the ground. Suddenly, Parker and Longbaugh open fire from a nearby hilltop, igniting a fierce firefight that kills the two officers before Jeffers shoves Painter and Robin into his car and drives off, leaving the dead officers and a wounded Obecks in the motel parking lot.Parker and Longbaugh torture the wounded Obecks to gain Robin's location, while Jeffers confines Robin in the room of a secluded Mexican brothel and forces Painter to perform a cesarian section on her to retrieve the baby, despite Robin's confession that the child was conceived between her and Painter and is not Chidduck's. During the operation, the heavily-armed Parker and Longbaugh infiltrate the brothel and search for Robin. The ensuing ambush, that leaves Parker wounded, turns into another standoff with Jeffers threatening to kill Painter and the baby before Painter kills Jeffers with a hidden gun. Outside the brothel, Sarno arrives with a group of bag men and the $15 million ransom, which they stack in the courtyard. Parker wants to kidnap Robin and Painter again, to which Longbaugh, guilt ridden after seeing her condition, says ""She's had enough"". Despite realizing that the $15 million is bait, Parker and Longbaugh charge headlong into an ambush.All of Sarno's men are killed in the ensuing gunfight. However, Sarno manages to shoot and cripple the already wounded Parker and Longbaugh, and then calls for an ambulance. As a child's cries break the silence, Painter emerges with Robin, newborn baby in her arms. Lying in a pool of blood, Parker and Longbaugh call out to Sarno, informing him that the baby is in fact Robin and Painter's, and thus Sarno's own grandson. Painter wonders aloud if this fact will influence Sarno to let them keep the child. Robin and her baby are then taken away in the ambulance with Painter, Sarno and the $15 million, leaving Parker and Longbaugh to bleed out.Miles away and days later, Chidduck's wife reveals that she's pregnant (possibly from Jeffers, with whom she was having an affair)."

Amores Perros,2000,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0245712/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A horrific car accident connects three stories, each involving characters dealing with loss, regret, and life's harsh realities, all in the name of love. On the brink of the new Millennium in the bustling City of Mexico, one horrible car accident intertwines inextricably the lives of three perfect strangers. Octavio, a rebellious adolescent who is secretly in love with his sister-in-law, dreams of escaping his miserable life, and for this reason, he enters reluctantly the obscure world of dog fighting with his lethal dog Cofi. And then unexpectedly, Valeria, a stunning woman and famous supermodel, will cross paths with Octavio, while in the meantime, her pampered little dog Richie manages to vanish into thin air in the confined space of her apartment. Lastly, Chivo, an ex-guerrilla vagabond, after abandoning his little daughter, unable to make up for lost time, he channels his love to the city's strays and a mortally wounded Rottweiler. In the end, even though all the weary characters, men and beasts, wish for a bright future, in this life-changing journey in the pursuit of love, sometimes infidelity, sin and death can get in the way.—Nick Riganas Three interconnected stories about the different strata of life in Mexico City all resolve with a fatal car accident. Octavio is trying to raise enough money to run away with his sister-in-law, and decides to enter his dog Cofi into the world of dogfighting. After a dogfight goes bad, Octavio flees in his car, running a red light and causing the accident. Daniel and Valeria's new-found bliss is prematurely ended when she loses her leg in the accident. El Chivo is a homeless man who cares for stray dogs and is there to witness the collision.—Anonymous The film opens in the harsh streets of Mexico, where a young man named Octavio and his pal Jorge are speeding down the road. In the backseat of their car lies Octavio's dog, Cofi, a rottweiler who's bleeding all over the seat. Octavio is freaking out, not just because he has to take Cofi to a veterinarian, but he and Jorge are also being chased by some thugs in a yellow truck, shooting at them. Eventually, Octavio loses them, but wrecks his car at an intersection. This wreck sets the stage for the rest of the plot.We then cut back a few days, where we see a punk named Jarocho submitting his dog into the back alley dogfights, held by overweight thug Gerardo, known as ""Fatso"". Jarocho's dog wins the fight, killing the other dog, and Jarocho collects an easy 20,000 pesos. Jarocho is feeling so high and mighty that he decides to let his winning dog loose on some strays, but is stopped when a vagrant named El Chivo pulls out a machete, causing Jarocho and his pals to walk away. Instead, Jarocho sees Octavio's rottweiler, Cofi, wandering the streets, and fully aware of this, he lets his dog loose on it. We then see a rundown home, where Octavio lives with his mother, his brother, Ramiro, and Ramiro's wife, Susana. Octavio is secretly in love with Susana, and despises Ramiro, who beats and cheats on her. Ramiro works as cashier at a local supermarket and is constantly out of money, so he can't pay for diapers or milk for the baby, which frustrates Susana. To earn a little extra cash, Ramiro and his buddy hold-up gas stations, dugstores and groceries. One day, Ramiro says, he will rob a bank, and get all the money he needs.Jorge eventually shows up at Octavio's, and tells him that Cofi killed Jarocho's dog. Cofi runs up to Octavio, covered in blood, and sits by his master. Suddenly, Jarocho drives up (in the yellow truck) and demands that Octavio give him the money he will lose now that his dog is dead; alternatively, Octavio can lend Cofi to him. Octavio refuses, but Jarocho threatens him and says that Octavio owes him. Octavio just laughs as Jarocho drives away. This gives Octavio an idea. He decides to submit Cofi into the local dogfights, and talks to Fatso. After seeing Cofi win a fight quickly, Fatso agrees to let Octavio participate, and says that Cofi is good for eight fights. Every time there's a fight, Jarocho enters a new dog, and everytime, Cofi kills it. Soon, Octavio is raking in some serious cash. It is now that he asks Susana to go away with him, to the border where they could open a little shop and live together with Susana's baby. Susana politely refuses, saying her love is for Ramiro. However, Susana does confide in Octavio that she is pregnant again, and if Ramiro finds out, he'll be very angry. Octavio promises not to tell. One night, Octavio goes to the drugstore that Ramiro works at, and buys some supplies for the baby. Ramiro gets annoyed, claiming that he can provide for his own child, and threatens Octavio. Octavio tells Ramiro that he's not afraid of him, and headbutts him in the face, making Ramiro's nose bleed. When Ramiro gets home, he beats the crap out of Octavio.After winning more money from Cofi's fights, Octavio keeps pushing Susana to go away with him. He even tries to make passes at her, but she keeps brushing him away. Finally, however, Susana gives in, and she and Octavio embark on an affair. He asks her what she's going to name her unborn child. She says if it's a girl, then Susana would be nice. Octavio suggests his own name if it's a boy, but Susana does not respond to that. Soon, Ramiro begins to catch on about where Octavio's money comes from, and insists on having half of what Octavio gets, since Cofi is technically Ramiro's dog. Octavio refuses. Ramiro then pulls out a gun, points it at Cofi, and fires. Octavio jumps, but the gun is empty. Ramiro then demands half of the earnings.A few days later, Fatso notifies Octavio that Jarocho has a Class-A fighting dog, and that he challenges Octavio to a private fight, with no outside bets, for a cool 40,000. Octavio accepts, but asks Fatso for a favor. The favor, as it turns out, is getting rid of Ramiro, so, after work one night, Ramiro is jumped by Fatso's thugs, taken to the middle of nowhere, and beaten to an inch of his life. This scene plays simultaneously with Octavio and Susana having sex on top of the washing machine. Octavio then asks her to come away with him, that weekend, since he's about to hit a big score. The night before the fight, though, Octavio learns that Ramiro has left, with Susana and the baby. Octavio searches his things, and finds that most of his winnings are gone as well. The next day, he and Jorge scrounge up about 20,000. While Octavio is counting the money, Jorge is watching a talk show, featuing a beautiful young model named Valeria (This comes into play later).Octavio and Jorge go the fight, and even though they have just 20,000 instead of the initial 40,000, Jarocho agrees, and the fight begins. Cofi is doing some serious damage to the other dog, when suddenly, Jarocho pulls out a gun and shoots Cofi. Octavio freaks out, and tells Fatso to do something, but Fatso just claims that this is between them. Jorge and Octavio carry Cofi to their car, and put him in the backseat. Octavio tells Jorge to start the car and keep it running, then walks back inside, and stabs Jarocho in the stomach. Octavio then runs back to his car, and speeds away, being pursued by Jarocho's thugs. This is where the wreck occurs.The next story involves the model, Valeria, who was seen earlier. She has just finished the talk show, and is being escorted by a dashing older movie star, who is rumored to be her boyfriend. He leads her to a nicely furnished apartment, with all of her things and a nice view of an advertisement on a billboard with her picture on it. Valeria finds this rather spooky, until her real boyfriend, an older man named Daniel, surprises her. He's bought the apartment for them, with everything he had, and left his wife and two daughters for the much younger Valeria. When she runs to embrace him, part of the floor gives under her heels. Daniel has also brought her dog, a little terrier (I think) named Richie. Their dinner is complete, except for the wine, which Valeria goes to get. She's in her car with Richie, and when she pulls into a certain intersection, she is blindsided by Octavio. Valeria is rushed to a hospital, where Daniel learns from her doctor that Valeria's right leg has almost been completely crushed, but it's salvageable. Richie, however, survived the crash without a scratch on him. Valeria is finally allowed to go home, but she grows bored of being alone while Daniel is at work. One day, while she is playing fetch with Richie, the ball rolls into the hole in the floor, and Richie climbs in to find it. Valeria calls him back, but he doesn't come. When Daniel comes home five hours later, Richie still hasn't come back, and Valeria is growing worried. In the middle of the night, Valeria can hear
Richie scratching and whimpering. She tells Daniel to go rescue Richie, but Daniel has no success. It is during this period of time that Valeria and Daniel's relationship grows strained. She is constantly nagging at him for not trying to rescue Richie, and he is having second thoughts about leaving his wife. One night, they have an enormous fight, with the sounds of Richie trying to escape in the background. The next morning, Daniel tells Valeria he'll be home in a few hours. Valeria says she doesn't care if he never comes back at all. That night, Daniel comes home, but Valeria has locked him out of their bedroom. Daniel, not in the mood for a fight, decides to sleep on the couch. Later into the night, he demands to be let back in. He finally breaks down the door, and finds Valeria lying on the floor, unconscious. Daniel rushes her to the hospital, where her doctor explains that her leg eventually became infected with gangrene and had to be amputated. Daniel goes home that night, and after hearing Richie, tears apart the floor, until he finds the poor little dog, lying unconscious. The sounds he and Valeria had been hearing were actually some rats that inhabited the building. Valeria finally comes home, and is very upset. She goes to the window and takes Daniel's hand. The advertisement that had once had her picture on it is now gone, and the billboard is now up for rental.The final story involves the vagrant, El Chivo. Chivo wanders the streets and collects the city's strays. Also, he is a part-time hitman. Early in the film, he shot a businessman in a restaurant in broad daylight. Later, he is reading the newspaper about the murder, and the paper states that no suspects have been found. On another page, Chivo reads the obituary of a woman. He begins to tear up, and goes to the funeral. He stands and watches the service from afar. An older woman at the funeral sees him, and escorts the deceased's daughter away. Then, the woman confront Chivo, and tells him to go away. It is revealed that the woman is his sister-in-law, and the young girl was his estranged daughter, who thinks that Chivo is dead. Through some explanations from a crooked cop, we learn that Chivo used to be a professor, but one day he went mad and joined the guerrillas. He left his wife and daughter and eventually was captured and served time in prison. When the cop found him, Chivo was nothing more than a wino, but the cop hired Chivo to do some hits, and Chivo was so good, that the cop keeps sending business his way. A new assignment comes up, and it involves a young businessman who wants his partner dead. Chivo asks for 100,000 upfront, and demands another 50,000 once the job is done. Chivo then begins to follow the partner around. One day, while standing at the corner of a street, Chivo sees two cars collide (Octavio and Valeria). Chivo rushes over to Octavio's car, and helps Octavio out. Octavio has broken his leg, and has some gashes to his head, but Jorge is killed. He also swipes Octavio's money and wallet and even takes the wounded Cofi back to his hideaway. Chivo nurses Cofi back to health. He also makes several attempts to establish contact with his daughter, but nothing comes of it. He even breaks into her apartment when she is not there, and steals a graduation picture of her, her mother, and her stepfather. Chivo goes to a photo booth, takes some pictures of his shaggy and weathered face, and places his photo over the face of the stepfather. As he passes the photo booth, Chivo sees Ramiro, with Susana and their baby. Ramiro finally decides to rob the bank with his buddy, and is almost successful, until an off-duty cop rushes in and shoots Ramiro, killing him. At his funeral, Octavio, now bald with cuts on his head and being supported by crutches, confronts Susana, and tells her that he is leaving that weekend, and that he'll wait for her. Susana says no, that Octavio doesn't get it, and finally declares that the unborn child will be named Ramiro. A few days later, Octavio waits at the bus station for her, but she never shows. Octavio does not get onto the bus.One day, Chivo comes home and finds Cofi, with blood all over him. Chivo rushes to the back of his hideaway and finds his other dogs are dead, killed by Cofi. Chivo is so torn up about this, he pulls out his gun and is about to shoot Cofi, but can't bring himself to do it. He burns the remains of the other dogs, and decides to carry out the hit. He apprehends the partner at a Blockbuster, and takes him back to his hideaway. Chivo ties the partner up against a pole, and leaves him there for a few days, yet does not kill him. Chivo then contacts the businessman and tells him to come to the hideaway. The businessman shows up with the rest of the money, but is shocked to see his partner still alive. Chivo quickly turns the tables, and ties the businessman up as well. Chivo then learns that the two men are not only partner, but brothers as well. The next morning, Chivo awakes and shaves and cuts his hair. He steals the businessman's suit, and leaves the two there, still tied up loosely, but places a loaded gun between them, so they will kill each other. He stops at the photo booth and takes another picture, this time with his cleaned up face. Chivo takes Cofi and they go back to Chivo's daughter's apartment. Using the businessman's cell phone, Chivo calls his daughter's phone and leaves a message, saying how sorry he is that he wasn't there for her, and that he loves her. He then takes out the graduation photo, and puts the new photo on top of the old one. He then sells the businessman's SUV to a chopshop, and wanders into the unknown, with Cofi by his side."

Sara Goldfarb (Ellen Burstyn) is a retired widow, living in a small apartment. She spends most of her time watching TV, especially a particular self-help show. She has delusions of rising above her current dull existence by being a guest on that show. Her son, Harry (Jared Leto) is a junkie but along with his friend Tyrone (Marlon Wayans) has visions of making it big by becoming a drug dealer. Harry's girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly) could be fashion designer or artist but is swept along in Harry's drug-centric world. Meanwhile Sara has developed an addiction of her own.

Brooklynite friends Harry Goldfarb and Tyrone C. Love are aimless and somewhat shiftless, they making what little money by continually stealing and pawning Harry's widowed Brighton Beach mother Sara Goldfarb's aged television set, which she always buys back in not wanting to get her dear son in trouble in he being the only person in her life on who she can count. Seizing upon an opportunity, Harry and Tyrone decide to start dealing in heroin, Tyrone seeing the money as an escape from his ghetto life and a means for approval from his mother. Also along for their ride is Harry's privileged girlfriend, Marion Silver, who rebels against that privilege in needing something other than money from her family.

Abe tries to get Sara to turn Harry in, but she doesn't have the heart for it, as Harry is all she has left after the death of her husband, Seymour, twenty years prior.Harry and Tyrone eventually come up with a plan to make money by reselling heroin on the street so that they can get away from their dead-end lives. Over the summer, they make a fair amount of money. They talk regularly about buying a pound of extremely pure heroin as their 'big score' that will give them comfortable lives when they invest that money in a legal business.Marion Silver (Jennifer Connelly), who is Harry's girlfriend, has a distant relationship with her parents (who are never seen on camera), but sometimes goes out with Arnold (Sean Gullette), her psychiatrist, in order to appease them.

As Harry starts earning money, he and Marion talk about opening a clothing store where Marion can earn a living as a clothing designer.Meanwhile, Sara is a TV junkie, obsessed with an infomercial hosted by self-help guru Tappy Tibbons (Christopher McDonald), based on the acronym JUICE (Join Us In Creating Excitement). One day she receives a mysterious call from someone who claims that she has been selected to appear on a TV show. Thinking she's being invited to appear on the Tappy Tibbons infomercial, Sara is suddenly obsessed with the idea of flaunting Harry on the show before a national audience. She wants to wear a particular red dress that she wore at Harry's high school graduation; a dress that Seymour loved to see her in. However, she is now too overweight to fit into it. One of Sara's friends, with whom she sometimes sits outside her apartment, gives her a diet book; but of course the ""grapefruit and coffee"" diet leaves her constantly hungry.

Gazing at the money in the shoe box, he reminisces about running home and into his mother's arms before making love to his girlfriend.As summer progresses to fall, so do the debilitating effects of the drugs that Harry, Tyrone, Marion, and Sara use. The money that Harry and Tyrone had saved starts to dwindle. First, Harry buys Sara a large, new TV/entertainment set. Tyrone gets caught in the middle of a drug gang assassination, lands in jail and needs to be bailed out. While visiting Sara to tell her about the new TV set he's gotten her, Harry finds out that the diet pills that Sara is taking are methamphetamine 'uppers,' or 'speed,' and warns her of the dangers involved. However, Sara delivers a passionate monologue about how her upcoming television appearance is giving her a new lease on life. Harry leaves in a taxi, shattered emotionally by his mother's situation, but he won't do anything to prevent her addiction growing.Eventually, Tyrone, Harry and Marion all run out of both drugs and money. Without money they cannot buy more drugs. Harry pleads with Marion to ask Arnold for $2,000 so that Harry and Tyrone can make a purchase from a notorious mob figure. As Marion fears, Arnold wants her to sleep with him in return, and she reluctantly complies with Harry's acceptance. At the site of the drug deal, a scuffle breaks out among buyers trying to push ahead in the line, and the supplier opens fire before driving away, leaving several people -- Harry included -- without any drugs.Sara loses weight gradually, the zipper on her dress coming tantalizingly closer to zipping up completely. But she also develops a tolerance for the pills that lead her to continually increase her dosage without consulting her doctor, and she slips into drug-induced psychosis that causes her to experience hallucinations involving her refrigerator, which get more and more intense. Sara begins to regularly hallucinate that she is the guest of honor on Tappy Tibbons' infomercial and gets to speak with the man himself.Harry's relationship with Marion starts to crumble when the need for drugs starts to overcome their sensibilities and the love they have for each other. Marion blames Harry for the failed purchase from the mob figure. After one major fight, Harry gives her a phone number for a major dealer named Big Tim (Keith David), who he heard about from Tyrone. Harry and Tyrone couldn't buy from Tim because he was more interested in 'pussy' than money. Harry also discovers a black spot on his arm where he injects the heroin.Fall fades into winter. As a result of increasing drug gang violence and police crackdowns, Harry and Tyrone cannot find any heroin in the city, so they decide to drive to Florida to make a purchase. Marion goes through severe deprivation withdrawal and she tearfully begs Tyrone and Harry's regular contact, Angel, for help, but he rebuffs her because she is broke. In desperation, she calls Big Tim and goes to his house. Although she is hesitant for a moment, she gives him a blow job in return for a fix. Pleased with her performance, Big Tim invites her to a big orgy event at his house later in the week.The invitation for Sara to appear on TV has not arrived, and her hallucinations with the refrigerator reach a climax as she takes more and more pills, thinking they will make the refrigerator stop. But instead, she finally hallucinates that the refrigerator lurches through the kitchen straight towards her and opens a wide toothy mouth. Sara runs from her apartment in fear, wearing no winter coat even though shoveled snow lines both sides of the streets. She wanders in a stupor, gets on the subway and finds her way to a Manhattan television station, begging to know when she will be on television. The receptionist and TV executives stall for time so they can contact paramedics who take her to a mental hospital.As Harry and Tyrone are headed to Florida, the black spot on Harry's arm grows to an alarming size and he begins complaining about the pain. Tyrone drives Harry to a hospital. One look at Harry's arm and the triage doctor knows that Harry is a drug addict. He discreetly excuses himself taking all drugs with him and calls the county sheriff's department, taking the medicine and drugs which were previously lying around with him, just in case. Tyrone and Harry are arrested and sent to jail, where Tyrone is subjected to racist guards and punishing work detail. Harry uses his phone call to contact Marion. She begs him to come home right away, and he promises her he will, but she knows he is lying. As they speak on the phone, Marion is getting dressed up to attend Big Tim's party.At the mental hospital, Sara refuses treatment and refuses to eat, and her psychosis only deepens. Still delusional, she unwittingly and unknowingly signs an authorization for doctors to put her through electro-shock therapy.While clearing prisoners for work detail, a prison doctor finds Harry's arm has become almost completely black and gives off a foul odor, and the pain is too much for Harry to bear. He is sent to the prison infirmary, where the doctors quickly determine they must immediately cut off Harry's arm at the shoulder to save his life.At Big Tim's party, Marion engages in a variety of sex acts including an 'ass to ass' with another woman.Harry has a dream of running toward a smiling Marion as she waits for him on a Coney Island pier, and then awakens in a hospital ward with a beautiful, kind nurse (Lianna Pai) watching over him. Hearing him speak Marion's name, the nurse promises to contact her and arrange to have her come see him. But Harry knows she will not come; he knows he's lost her.Marion arrives home from Big Tim's party, clutching a large plastic bag to her breast; she's been paid very well and Big Tim likes her enough to be her supplier as long as she pleases him. She lies down on her couch and smiles blissfully.Tyrone and several other prisoners are ushered into a common cell after work detail and Tyrone lies down on a cot, exhausted, with only a pillow and no blanket.Two of Sara's friends visit her at the mental hospital, and are so horrified and shocked at the sight of her as a hollow shell of her former self that they sob uncontrollably in each others' arms while waiting for their bus back home.All four main characters are shown curling up in a fetal position: Harry in the hospital bed with his arm amputated, Marion on her couch after gaining a regular drug supplier in return for her favors, Tyrone on a cot in prison as he dreams of his childhood and his mother, and Sara in a bed at the mental hospital.The movie closes with Sara having another hallucination where she is a grand prize winner on the Tappy Tibbons show, wearing her red dress and looking beautiful; showing off Harry, who in her dreams, has become a successful businessman engaged to marry Marion, to a cheering audience."

However, they agree to keep their bond platonic so as not to commit similar wrongs. Set in Hong Kong, 1962, Chow Mo-Wan is a newspaper editor who moves into a new building with his wife. At the same time, Su Li-zhen, a beautiful secretary and her executive husband also move in to the crowded building. With their spouses often away, Chow and Li-zhen spend most of their time together as friends. They have everything in common from noodle shops to martial arts. Soon, they are shocked to discover that their spouses are having an affair. Hurt and angry, they find comfort in their growing friendship even as they resolve not to be like their unfaithful mates.—Anonymous 1962, Hong Kong. On the exact same two days, Mr. and Mrs. Chow and Mr. and Mrs. Chan, who don't know each other, rent a room in adjacent flats from the resident owner, Mr. and Mrs. Koo and Mrs. Suen respectively, and move into their room. They join the friendly relationship that exists between their landlords and the other residents of the building, although the Chows and Chans' entry into the relationships are more cordial than friendly. With Mrs. Chow and Mr. Chan often out of town either on business or personal matters, Mr. Chow and Mrs. Chan lead a somewhat emotionally lonely existence. The cordiality and emotional isolation extend to Mr. Chow and Mrs. Chan's working lives. Mr. Chan, a newspaper journalist who would rather be writing martial arts serials, has as his closest work colleague Ping, a gambler who often takes advantage of that friendship. And Mrs. Chan's job as a secretary to married Mr. Ho largely entails her handling his personal affairs, including managing and facilitating his affair with Miss Yu, something she cannot talk about to anyone. Eventually, Mr. Chow and Mrs. Chan individually come to the realization that their respective spouses are having an affair with each other, mostly taking place when they are out of town together. In dealing with this joint betrayal of their respective marriages, Mr. Chow and Mrs. Chan begin spending time together. Despite they not doing anything untoward with each other, they do not tell anyone of their time together in the inappropriateness of two married people of the opposite sex being alone with each other. As they try to figure out what to do about their respective marriages, the situation becomes more complicated when they admit that they are falling in love with each other, something that neither intended when they began their friendship.—Huggo Hong Kong, 1962. Two married couples, the Chans and the Chows, move in next door to each other. Mr Chan is hardly around, regularly disappearing overseas on business.

Blemished by betrayal's painful stain, the lithe Mrs Chan and the morosely handsome Mr Chow now struggle to understand--and keep at bay bottled-up emotions, repression, and loneliness--bound by their noble beliefs and their inflexible morality. However, little by little, a silently passionate undercurrent of inexpressible affection starts to creep up on them, as both find themselves powerless before the catalytic force of love. Are man's vows strong enough to suppress desire?—Nick Riganas Two couples Mr and Mrs Chan ( Mrs Chan played by Maggie Cheung ) and Mr and Mrs Chow ( Mr Chow played by Tony Leung Chiu Wai ) move into the same building on the same day. Both spend much time alone as their respective spouses work long hours. One day they discover when talking things over that their spouses are having an affaire. The two lonely hurt people come together as friends and try to reproduce the infidelity of their husband and wife whilst analysing just how it happened. Deciding in doing so to avoid the usual clichés and above all not become like 'them' they end up by falling in love for real. In becoming what they had objected to and despised they break up and leave for different lives. In the end of the movie we learn that both of the couples have split up and are alone. Mrs Chan has a son which we assume could be Mr Chow's although their 'union' was never actually shown, but implied. A divine movie with a beautiful haunting music and fabulous photography.

Bamboozled,2000,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0215545/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A frustrated African-American TV writer proposes a blackface minstrel show in protest, but to his chagrin, it becomes a hit. Dark, biting satire of the television industry, focusing on an Ivy League educated black writer at a major network. Frustrated that his ideas for a ""Cosby Show""-esque take on the black family have been rejected by network brass, he devises an outlandish scheme: reviving the minstrel show. This is the hook: Instead of white actors in black face, the show stars black actors in even blacker face. The show becomes an instant smash, but with the success also come repercussions for all involved.—N. Cognito <nobody@noplace> In a New York City residence, Pierre Delacroix (Damon Wayans) rises to begin his daily routine. Brushing his teeth, he gives us by voice over a definition of satire. He tells us that with the rise of the Internet, video and interactive games, his field as a television writer has seen a drop in popularity. Meanwhile, in a dilapidated building, squatter Womack (Tommy Davidson) wakes up his friend Manray (Savion Glover) for a day of work. This consists of travelling to the CNS (Continental Network System) building where Delacroix works, and Manray tap-dancing to entertain the workers. They then collect money from the workers. The men see Delacroix walk by, and ask him for monetary help in the form of work of some kind.Delacroix walks into a staff meeting late and is immediately castigated by his boss, Thomas Dunwitty (Michael Rapaport). Dunwitty informs the staff that CNS has poor ratings. He says he wants them to write funnier material, and ends the meeting. In the privacy of his office, Dunwitty tells Delacroix that the material Delacroix's been writing for him seems like it's about white people with black faces. Dunwitty asserts that Delacroix is an ""oreo"" with his Harvard education, because he won't write a ""n----r show.""The next day, Delacroix and his assistant Sloan Hopkins (Jada Pinkett Smith) talk. They've decided that Manray is the solution to his problem. Delacroix plans to write a show that will be so ""offensive and racist,"" it will prove his point that the network only wants to see black buffoons on the air. Delacroix simply hopes to be fired so he can be let go of his contract with CNS. Manray and Womack ask the receptionist for a ""Delapoint"" and the men working there tell them to step outside. However, Sloan steps into the lobby, sees what's happening, and escorts Manray and Womack to Delacroix's office. Delacroix explains to them that he has an idea for a television pilot, and they can make money with it. His main request is that Manray changes his name to Mantan, in an apparent homage to black character actor Mantan Moreland.On Sloan's walk home, she runs into her big brother Big Blak Afrika F/K/A Julius (Yasiin Bey). In Sloan's apartment, Julius and Sloan argue about his values, and he tells her to introduce him and his political hip-hop crew, the Mau Maus, to Delacroix.Delacroix has another meeting with Dunwitty. Delacroix proposes that the network start a variety show called ""Mantan: The New Millenium Minstrel Show."" Delacroix says that new faces are needed for the show, and has Sloan bring in Manray and Womack. The two men, respectively renamed ""Mantan"" and ""Sleep'n Eat,"" will exhibit a range of stereotypical traits, Delacroix explains. Sloan is opposed to the proceedings, and suggests that there will be protest of the show they are planning. To seal the package, Manray dances atop a table in front of Dunwitty -- who immediately leaves to try to sell the show's concept to his executive bosses.Delacroix, Sloan and another woman hold auditions for the show. The first group of people (The Roots) audition to be the show's house band, The Alabama Porch Monkeys. After they perform, a dancer, a vulgar man shouting ""I be smackin' my hoes,"" and a didgeridoo player all audition. The next hopeful is Honeycutt (Thomas Jefferson Byrd), an actor who bungles Shakespearean quotes and proclaims ""N----s is a beautiful thing."" Sloan's brother's group, the Mau Maus then do a fiery, confrontational performance; Pierre states via voice over that there is no place for them in his plan.Delacroix looks over a revised script for the show and confronts Dunwitty and his co-writer, Jukka, about their alterations to it that even he finds racially offensive. Delacroix says he won't be responsible for their changes, which Dunwitty says are to make the show funnier. Dunwitty says he knows black people better than Delacroix does, telling him, ""Look at all the brothers on the wall"" (referring to numerous pictures of famous black men hanging up in Dunwitty's office). Dunwitty tells him not to interrupt them, and Delacroix expresses impotent rage at this before leaving.A dressed-up Honeycutt steps onto a stage and introduces himself to a TV studio audience. Backstage, Womack and Manray create blackface from burned cork, put it onto their faces, and apply fire-truck red lipstick to their mouths. Mantan, Sleep'n Eat and the Alabama Porch Monkeys are then unveiled to the audience. People in the audience are shocked and dismayed, as the two actors employ self-deprecating racial humor while Mantan tap dances. White people in the audience are mostly scared to laugh or show their enjoyment, but black people around them clap and laugh. The white people thus feel sanctioned in enjoying the show. A sign near the stage says ""Howl!"" and the non-black people, seeing the approving black people around them, applaud.To Delacroix's disbelief and displeasure, the CNS executives order 12 shows of ""Mantan"" for a mid-season replacement. As the show becomes more and more popular, sides are chosen in the resulting battle over representation. The success goes to Delacroix's head, and his intentions begin to change, defending the show as satire. Manray's success also goes to his head, berating the dancers he trains to appear on the show and dismissing Womack's concerns about his growing ego. Womack then tells him he's quitting.Delacroix accuses Sloan of harboring romantic feelings for Manray, which she denies. Delacroix tells Sloan to stop seeing Manray outside of work, and reminds her of a relationship they had in the past, calling her ""the help"". Sloan in turn calls him by his birth name Peerless Dothan, and confronts him over his selfishness and hypocrisy. She gives him a videotape before she leaves, telling him that it could save his life.Delacroix tells Manray to stop seeing Sloan, and asks him to think about how she got her job in the first place. Manray visits Sloan, and asks her how she got her job. Sloan admits her past sexual relationship with Delacroix, but denies it had anything to do with her employment. Manray is disgusted. Sloan asks him if he's a puppet for Dela.Delacroix talks to his mother on the phone. She is disheartened by the shows content. While she praises his hard work, she says that she's disappointed in him. Delacroix then perceives one of his black-themed antique collectible items moving by itself.At the next show, the audience (all wearing blackface) blatantly laugh at descriptions of slaves being beaten. Dunwitty, also in blackface, watches from the control room. Backstage, Manray thinks about his conversation with Sloan. Realizing he's being exploited by Dela, he leaves his dressing room without costume or blackface. He tells Delacroix that he'll now do the shows only as himself.Manray goes onstage, and the audience is confused. He gives a speech about his hardships. Dunwitty storms onstage, and has Manray removed from the building as Delacroix tries to save face. Manray walks into an alley and is abducted by the Mau Maus.
Angered at the show, they plan to execute him on live webcast. Major television networks are given permission to air it live.Delacroix, Sloan, Womack, and Dunnwitty each watch the broadcast in anxiety. The Mau Maus fire at Manray's feet to make him dance, before finally shooting him dead. Back in his office, Delacroix, now in blackface himself, mourns. He perceives his collectibles as staring him down, and trashes the office.The Mau Maus celebrate before being ambushed by the police, who kill they whole group except for the only white member, One-Sixteenth Blak, who begs to be killed as well.Sloan arrives at Delacroix's office with a gun, given to her by her late brother. She makes Dela play the tape, revealed to be a collection of racist and demeaning footage from film and television of the first half of the 20th century. When Dela tries to take the gun, Sloan accidentally pulls the trigger. Peerless takes the gun in his hands to make his death look like a suicide, as Sloan tearfully flees. Watching the tape as he dies, Peerless reflects on his misdeeds in a voice-over.The final shot is a closeup of the late Manray performing as Mantan."
The Dish,2000,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0205873/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A remote Australian community, populated by quirky characters, plays a key role in the first Apollo moon landing. In the days before the July 19, 1969 space mission that marked humankind's first steps on the moon, NASA was working with a group of Australian technicians who had agreed to rig up a satellite interface. That the Aussies placed the satellite dish smack dab in the middle of an Australian sheep farm in the boondocks town of Parkes was just one of the reasons that NASA was concerned. Based on a true story, The Dish takes a smart, witty, comical look at the differing cultural attitudes between Australia and the U.S. while revisiting one of the greatest events in history.—Anonymous Cliff Buxton returns to the tracking station in the Australian outback where, in 1969, he was in charge when NASA designated it their main southern hemisphere contact with the first Apollo moon mission. He recalls how town pride, the shaky electricity supply, a worried NASA official, and even romance played a part as tensions mounted with the world depending on them for pictures of the first moon walk.—Jeremy Perkins {J-26} Parkes (Australia), has a huge dish in the middle of a sheep paddock. It will transmit the first landing of humanity on the Moon, and the famous Neil Armstrong's moonwalk. They will be the ones broadcasting the moonwalk to a world audience which will remain the highest for many years to come.Cliff Buxton (Sam Neill) goes back to the satellite station and remembers it all. He was the chief scientifical supervisor, but then NASA took over. Not all employees accept that, and some of them are quite rude to NASA's representative and chielf operations director.The Mayor of the town of Parkes, Bob McIntyre (Roy Billing) acknowledges that this is the moment for him and his town to perform a great deed. Australian Prime Minister (Bille Brown) arrives, with a full gathering of people among which is American Ambassador (John McMartin), who insists on seeing the premises himself. Back at the station, Rudi (Tayler Kane) is one of the funniest characters. He's given a gun, becuase NASA demanded armed security, but when his sister Janine (Eliza Szonert) appears, and notices it, he begs her ""not to tell mum, or she will come to take it from me."" Janine is constantly providing home-made food for the dish's personnel, because she has a love interest in one of the mathematicians who work there. He is very shy, though, and it takes him a lot of time, mocking and coaxing from his workmates to ask her for a date. Rudi keeps changing the names of the areas within the complex ""A, B, C..."".The McIntyres prepare themselves for their outstanding visitors, However, the eldest daughter Marie (Lenka Kripac) is constantly making rude remarks, the son Billy (Carl Snell) knows about the technical data about the landing and tries to explain them to his father - who can never fully grasp it-, and the wife May (Genevieve Mooy) is worried most of all about her dressing. Another fun moment is when she asks her husband to choose among two dresses, one blue and another one lemon-coloured. McIntyre keeps on saying that it is a yellow dress, and May corrects him saying it's ""lemon"". When McIntyre introduces his wife to the ambassador, he is so nervous that he introduces his wife saying ""she's the lemon"".There are two main events at the station:
1- One of the employees does not charge enough fuel to one of the power stations. There is a sudden blackout and the station computers lose all data, so the staff at the complex loses all communication with Apollo 11's crew, because they cannot pinpoint the dish towards the rocket. However, nobody wants to admit their mistake to the NASA, in fear that they will leave them out of the broadcasting team. Finally, they find the location just in time.2- One of the reasons why Parkes was chosen was its perfectly stable weather. However, all of a sudden, a gale starts. Nobody expected such strong winds in Australia, - least of all the weather forecasters - but neither the dish nor the station had been designed to stand them. They decide to take their chances at broadcasting, because Armstrong has overruled a programmed sleep and has decided to go out of the rocket sooner than expected. If Parkes does not broadcast it, nobody will see it. The wind gets so strong, that the station crew is afraid that all the structure could collapse with them inside the building. However, they finally do it. Cliff remembers his late wife, who had suppported him through the years and dedicates his success to her memory.Back to the present time, a white-haired Cliff Buxton is told-off by more efficiente security guard who doesn't recognise him. He tells them that visitors are only permitted through the main gate. Cliff says that it doesn't matter, and leaves the premises whitout more ado."

Aren't there more important problems like pay equity and childcare to address? Yes, but boxing reaches out in a visceral way to viewers too worn down by life's own battles to do more than manage to pay the mortgage and get the kids off to school each morning. So by gaining access to the viewers through boxing, this film does further our national discussion of serious issues facing young women.Regardless of your position on the sport of boxing, this film allows views to address serious themes of sexism, gender identities for men and women, sexual stereotypes for both men and women, and the role of parental figures. The character development of Diana is somewhat formulaic, but some formulas work and should be applied in new arenas. This is a suitable arena for the hero's journey. And Diana (Michelle Rodriguez) notice the reference to the Greek goddess of the hunt embarks on a journey that is not easy as a woman, an athlete, or an ""at-risk"" teen. Girlfight does what movies are supposed to do: provide entertaining ways to introduce topics about the human experience that viewers end up discussing long after the popcorn and soda are gone."

Charlie lives and tells his own stories. What caused his melancholy?—<jhailey@hotmail.com>"

Timecode,2000,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0220100/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Four frames of simultaneous action that alternately follow a smitten lesbian lover as she obsesses over her partner's dalliances and the tense goings-on of a Hollywood film production company. The primary story with this movie is that it is shown in four simultaneously filmed ninety-three minute single shot takes (in other words, shown in four quadrants), with the actual plot secondary. The four cameras follow the players involved, with two or more of the four cameras sometimes filming the exact same scene from different angles and thus different perspectives. The audio on each of the four quadrants is turned up and down based on which quadrant(s) the viewer should pay most attention to at any given time. The actual plot, which takes place in Hollywood, involves the pre-production by Red Mullet Productions for the movie ""Bitch from Louisiana"". The production team is in an executive meeting to discuss several aspects of the movie, including problems with one of their own, Alex Green, who has been missing in action from much of the production and this meeting. Alex's problems stem from his substance abuse and philandering, his wife Emma who is contemplating leaving him, of which he is unaware. Lester Moore, the movie's director, is also causing the producers some concern as they believe he again is using drugs against company policy. The production team is also talking about casting the role of ""The Bitch"". One actress who wants to audition is Rose, who is having an affair with Alex as a foot in the door. Rose does not officially have an audition, although she tells her controlling lover, Lauren, that's why she is going to Red Mullet's office, while she really is meeting with Alex for a tryst. Lauren, however, believes that Rose is indeed cheating on her. Through it all, Quentin, a masseuse, is present giving free massages as a means to gain Red Mullet as a corporate client. Their goings-on come to a head during a pitch meeting by visiting European actress, Ana Pauls, who is accompanied by her agent, Bunny Drysdale, and her musician boyfriend, Joey Z.—Huggo L.A., real time. From her limo, the wealthy Lauren eavesdrops on her lover Rose's tryst with movie producer Alex Green. The assignation takes place in his company's screening room between meetings. Alex's wife walks from therapy to his office, tells him she's leaving him, weeps in a bookstore restroom, and walks home with a cocaine-sniffing actress friend for what may lead to sex. Alex is drinking, wants to quit work and move to Tuscany, laughs at pretentious movie pitches, and puts off Rose when she asks for an audition. A film director sees Rose and decides she's perfect for his next picture; she takes a screen test. She's ecstatic and calls Lauren: jealousy takes over.—<jhailey@hotmail.com> We begin simultaneously with a screen showing 4 different stories that will converge during the film. Lauren Hathaway (Jeanne Tripplehorn) clandestinely flattens the tire of the car belonging to actress Rose (Salma Hayek) her lover. Lauren is suspicious of her faithfulness and plants a secret microphone on Rose so she can overhear her conversations when they are apart. Rose is eager to get to the casting sessions for a new film, being directed by Lester Moore (Richard Edson). Alex Green (Stellan Skarsgard), the studio executive overseeing Moores project, has problems of his own connected to his wife Emma (Saffron Burrows), who is discussing her relationship problems with her Therapist played by Glenne Headly. Alex also has a substance-abuse problem and this negatively affects his ability to perform executive decisions and his sexual involvement with Rose compromises his marriage and his career. At the studio a local spa has sent over Quentin (Julian Sands), a Latin-speaking masseuse to give everyone back rubs during their business conferences. Rose has come to the studio to meet up with Alex as part of a seduction to obtain a favorable introduction and audition for the current film being cast. The story also spins out the day of producer Evan Watz (Xander Berkeley) and his relationship with Alex and the other executives of the film company and attempts to push forward in spite of Alexs obvious problems. When Scott ""Bunny"" Drysdale (Kyle MacLachlan) brings in his client, Euro filmmaker Ana Pauls (Mia Maestro), an artist with ideas to pitch a new project to the executive group with the assistance of white rap musician Joey Z (Alessandro Nivola), the film clearly moves into the realm of screwball comedy, but with a pacing and delivery of some very bitter-sweet reality show. During this slice of the work day a variety of actions disrupt the actions including drug and alcohol consumption, fornication physical abuse and a few earthquakes to further shake things up as well as the actual camera work."

Thats why he must go away from here. Out of the restroom. Just as Walter is asking her why she is after Bodo, Bodo comes home. He isnt happy to see Sissi. Sissi stands up.

When Bodo asks her why the two of them, she tells him that she dreamed they were brother and sister, wife and husband, mother and father. He answers that she is crazy, and she admits that maybe everything is wrong, but she thinks that it is luck. He answers that he doesnt believe in luck. When she says that he has just had too much bad luck, he asks what she knows about his bad luck. She tells him that she knows about his wife, the gas station, and the accident.

Suddenly, Bodo stands up and starts chasing Steini throughout the whole building. Sissi, who is still standing in the hall with her colleague, sees them and follow them. Steini climbs a ladder to the attic. Just as Bodo tries to enter the attic, Sissi catches up to him and asks him what happened. He explains that Steini tried to throw a plugged-in toaster into the water in the bathtub. She suddenly understands.Meanwhile, her colleague worries. She sees the police cars coming and goes outside.

She goes directly to Steini and asks him why he did it. He gives a confusing answer and says that he can jump. The police also arrive on the roof and move slowly toward the three people at the edge of the roof. Steini tries to explain that he just has to jump and then everything would be okay, but Sissi answers that he wont jump. She goes back to Bodo, takes his hand, and walks a few steps away. Suddenly, they jump from the roof. Everybody is shocked. Sissi and Bodo land in a little lake that had been covered up with leaves.

His doppelganger watches him during the drive. Bodo is crying again. Sissi wants to wipe away his tears, but he doesnt want her to touch him. His doppelganger suddenly closes Bodos eyes and forces him to stop the car. The doppelganger then asks him to leave the car and sits down next to Sissi. He starts the car and drives away, leaving Bodo behind. The new Bodo in the car takes Sissis hand. He is smiling.The camera then focuses on the picture of Sissis friend Maike, which is hanging in the car. Suddenly, the picture comes alive, and Maike is shown walking toward Sissi and Bodo, who have arrived at her house by the ocean in their old car.

The Crimson Rivers,2000,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0228786/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A murder detective must follow the footsteps of a brutal killer within the secrets of a classist college. Parisian murder detective commissioner Pierre Niemans is called to Guernon, a self-sufficient, prestigious university in a mountain valley, to investigate the murder on 32-year old professor and librarian Rémy Caillois, whose corpse was found 50 meters high on a steep mountain side, naked, horribly covered in bruises and bleeding wounds, the result of some five hours of bestial torture including quasi-surgical amputation of hands cauterized to prevent bleeding to death- and eyes. Guernon is a closed society of virtually incestuous scientists, de facto succeeding to their parents' posts; the eye-doctor, formerly on the staff, says hereditary genetic diseases are the price of such elitism, but in recent years spread to the simple farming families. Inspector Max Kerkerian examines two crimes in the town: a school break-in with theft of old photos and archive papers as well as a graveyard desecration of Judith Herault, the daughter of local nun Andrée, who lives in a dark cell since 15 years and mumbles the demons who made an attempt of both of their lives have returned to prevent the child endanger their secret. As both police investigations continue, the loner sleuths meet; secrets and other corpses are found, till it all ties together.—KGF Vissers Two very different policemen seeking the truth about separate crimes find a terrible common link in this thriller from France. Pierre Niemans (Jean Reno) is a noted French detective assigned to investigate a brutal murder at a prestigious college located high in the Alps; the victim was first disfigured and dismembered, then strangled to death. Niemans soon realizes the murder was not an isolated incident when several similarly mangled corpses are discovered. Meanwhile, in a town 150 miles away, a young police investigator, Max Kerkerian (Vincent Cassel), is called in to investigate when the grave of a ten-year-old girl is dug up and ransacked. While interviewing the mother (Dominique Sanda) of the young girl, he crosses paths with Niemans, whose investigation has led him to the same town, and the two men begin to realize a surprising and troubling link between the crimes. Two French policemen, one investigating a grisly murder at a remote mountain college, the other working on the desecration of a young girl's grave by skinheads, are brought together by the clues from their respective cases. Soon after they start working together, more murders are committed, and the pair begin to discover just what dark secrets are behind the killings.—Jean-Marc Rocher <rocher@fiberbit.net> Detective Superintendent (Commissaire Principal) Pierre Niemans (Jean Reno), an investigator well known in Paris, is sent to the small rural university town of Guernon in the French Alps to investigate a brutal murder. The victim's body is found bound in the fetal position and suspended high on a cliff face, his eyes removed and his hands cut off. Niemans learns that the victim was a professor and the University's librarian, Remy Callois, and he seeks out a local ophthalmologist for an explanation to the removal of the eyes. Dr. Cherneze, once on the University staff, explains that the school's isolation led to in-breeding amongst the professors, with increasingly serious genetic disorders. Recently the trend has reversed, with the local village children becoming ill and the college babies remaining healthy. Cherneze hints that the killer is leaving Niemans clues to their motive by removing the body parts that are unique to each individual - the eyes and hands. Niemans questions the Dean and examines the librarian's apartment, where he finds images of athletic ""supermen"" juxtaposed with texts on genetic deformities. The Dean's assistant (and son) Hubert translates the title of Callois' Ph.D. thesis as, ""We are the masters. We are the slaves. We are everywhere. We are nowhere. We control the crimson rivers.""Coincidentally Detective Inspector (Lieutenant de Police) Max Kerkerian (Vincent Cassel) is in the nearby town of Sarzac investigating the desecration of the grave of Judith Herault, a girl who died in 1982, and the theft of her photos from the local primary school. The girl was killed in a horrific highway accident, witnessed by her mother, who was so traumatized she took a vow of darkness in a nunnery. The mother tells Kerkerian that when Judith was ten she fell ill, and they went to get help in Guernon where she was born; she claims they were then attacked by ""demons"" and, when they fled, her daughter was killed in the road accident. She says the pictures were stolen to erase her daughter from history, and that her face is a threat to the demons who have returned to complete their mission. She tells him it all began in Guernon.Niemans questions Fanny Ferreira (Nadia Farès), a glaciologist and student, who is immediately suspect because of her climbing ability. Despite her contempt for the school and its arrogant professors, she works for the university to steer away frequent avalanches, and is incensed when Niemans implies she might withhold evidence to protect the school. She tells him that anyone with good equipment could've hoisted the body up the cliff, and brushes off his obvious attraction. Soon after, the pathologist reports that it was acid rain in Callois' eye sockets, which has not fallen in the area since the seventies. Niemans enlists Fanny to take him up the glacier to get ice samples to compare with the acid rain in Callois' eyes. On a hunch, Niemans follows a glacial melt tunnel to a cave that contains a second body, frozen into the ice.Kerkerian traces a car from the accident to Phillip Sertys in Guernon and meets Niemans while attempting to break into Sertys' apartment. Sertys is the body in the ice, a doctor that worked in the maternity ward at the University hospital. They find Judith's stolen photograph as well as evidence that Sertys was breeding and training fighting dogs - and then they find the dogs, and Niemans the ""supercop"" is momentarily paralyzed by fear, until Kerkerian coaxes him through.Sertys was also mutilated, and his eyes replaced with glass prosthetics, ""Like you would find at an eye doctor's"" remarks the pathologist, leading Niemans to race back to Cherneze's practice. The doctor is already dead, and they almost catch the killer, who fights off Niemans and races away after deliberately emptying Niemans' gun into the wall but not hitting him. Kerkerian gives chase but the killer escapes. Returning to the scene, where the killer has written ""I will trace the source of the crimson rivers"" in Cherneze's own blood above his body, they learn the prints on Niemans' gun belong to Judith Herault.Kerkerian goes back to search the grave in Sarzac, which is empty except for a picture, while Niemans goes to Fanny's home. Niemans tells her that although he sees her as physically capable of committing the crimes he doesn't believe her to be guilty. When he returns to the university, the local police captain tells him that Callois' thesis is full of Nazi-style eugenics, suggesting perfection can be achieved by breeding athletically gifted and intellectually gifted children together.Kerkerian returns with the photo which Niemans recognizes as Fanny and, on the way to her house, they narrowly avoid being run off the road by the Dean's son as they piece together the story. Due to the poor bloodlines and genetic mutations in the faculty's inbred offspring, the doctors at the hospital had been swapping healthy village children with the university children. Sertys, they deduce, must have swapped Fanny for Judith, and Callois arranged the matches in the college's breeding program. Once at Fanny's house they find the missing hands and eyes of the victims in her basement, but Fanny is now gone and so are her grenades. Niemans gives the order to evacuate the university while he and Kerkerian travel up the mountain to find Fanny.The duo confront Fanny only to be set upon by Judith, who is her identical twin. Judith tells Fanny to kill Niemans she refuses, and instead turns the gun on her sister. At the same time Kerkerian fires at Judith but hits Fanny in the shoulder and the gunshots trigger an avalanche. Judith is swept away and the rest are buried in the snow until a rescue team arrives with search dogs. Fanny is airlifted to hospital while Kerkerian asks Niemans to explain his fear of dogs."

Waking the Dead,2000,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0127349/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A congressional candidate questions his sanity after seeing the love of his life, presumed dead, suddenly emerge. Fielding Pierce lives the life of an aspiring politician - in 1972 he's serving in the Coast Guard (trying to avoid Vietnam in the most honorable way), and by 1973 he has entered law school. Along the way he falls in love with Sarah, a fiercely idealistic woman who devotes her life to helping others - unfortunately she's killed in an explosion while assisting members of the Chilean resistance. Nine years later, in the middle of a congressional election, Fielding is suddenly flooded with thoughts and visions of his lost love.—ccampbell The first scene of the movie introduces Fielding Pierce (Billy Crudup) as he is watching news footage showing that Sarah Williams (Jennifer Connelly) has been killed in a suspected car bombing. The reporter indicates that Sarah was an activist from Chicago involved in helping refugees from the Chilean government and that her death may cast new light on the movement. Fielding is completely distraught over hearing this news and the movie begins.The first 3/4 of the movie unfolds on parallel timelines in the 70s and early 80s: the progression of Fielding & Sarah's complicated, volatile relationship and Fielding's ascension into power as an upcoming politician dealing with the recent loss (and haunting memories) of Sarah.Fielding meets Sarah as he is returning, in uniform, from duty in the Coast Guard and meeting up with his brother, who is a editor. The brother, Fielding and Sarah all go to lunch where Fielding is very ouspoken in his political ideals about current events. Sarah and Fielding are both immediately intrigued by each other, Fielding's attraction being more sexual and blatant and Sarah's attraction more of curiousity and intrigue. A few dates quickly lead to a sexual relationship despite an obvious difference in political thinking between the two. Sarah asks why Fielding wants to be a senator and his very serious reply is that he doesn't- he wants to be president. Sarah is later quoted as saying ""Ambition is the ice in the lake of emotion."" And when Fielding tries to comfort Sarah's fear of his Coast Guard duty leading to a Vietnam tour, she replies ""but if you go over there, you'll be shooting at the guys that I want to win."" Their intense love outweighs their differences, though, and their relationship quickly becomes serious.Meanwhile Fielding is a young politician being groomed to be congressman by the current govenor because of a scandal involving Jerry Carmichael 's (Ed Harris in a cameo role) resignation due to his homosexuality. Fielding seems ambivalent about the offer to be put on the ticket, perhaps because of the nature of the resignation- as he indicates- or pehaps because of the impact of Sarah's influence on his current ambitions. Either way, the governor and his top advisor Isaac (Hal Holbrook) are not comfortable with this lack of enthusiasm and do not offer much hand holding. This confrontation sets the tone for the later timeline in Fielding's life as his insecurities and haunting memories of Sarah eventually lead to hallucinations and his emotional breakdown. Fielding is now dating Isaac's daughter, but their relationship is clearly not as intense as his past relationship with Sarah. Conversations with his sister Caroline (Janet McTeer) and visits with his dad quickly lead to discussions about Sarah and how is haunting memories are leading to him seeing Sarah again. His family is supportive without offering any helpful advice other than to focus more on the political path ahead of him.Sarah and Fielding's relationship takes them to Chicago where they share an apartment as he continues law school and she begins missionary work for a local church led by Father Steven (John Carrol Lynch). Fielding's involvement with Isaac soon begins, and Sarah's aversion to the whole political process becomes more threatening. After a uncomfortable encounter with Sarah at one of Fielding's political events, where her disdain for the situation leads to a verbal attack on one of the attendees, they attempt to reconcile on the subway afterwards. They cannot reach an agreement and she proclaims ""It is so infuriating loving you!"" Fielding chuckes and says that the feeling is mutual. Sarah's long hours away from home, spent working at the church, lead Fielding to foolishly suspect Sarah is having an affair with Father Steven. Their intense bond holds them together through their disagreements and insecurities.Fielding starts the campaign trail even as his memories of Sarah convince him that she may still be alive and is watching him. He even chases someone he believes to be her through town and eventually ending at a church. But his search is fruitless and only further shows his descent into emotional breakdown. His relationship with Molly becomes troubled as he emotionally withdraws from her also. When she tries to reach to him, he does not offer any recognition of her or his feelings.Sarah's missionary work leads to activist work in Chile where her and Father Steven bring back political refugees of the government. At one uncomfortable dinner at the church with Fielding. The refugees are appalled to hear that Fielding is hoping to enter politics, an american institution they feel is overrun with corruption. Fielding tries to convince them he is not entering politics to become corrupt but to affect change. They are not conducive to this idea. He chastises their hypocrisy by observing that as awful as they try to hint his government is, he can't help but to notice when they needed help they ran to this country for freedom. When he turns to Sarah for help, she offers ""You are alone in this conversation."" Fielding then replies he is alone in this whole room and he is ""choking on the collective sense of superiority."" Fielding and Sarah's political difference and growing distance is shown at its worst, as no make up scene follows. Soon after Sarah leaves for her fatal trip in Milwauke."

Hey Ram,2000,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0222012/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Saketh Ram's wife is raped and killed during direct action day riots in Calcutta. He is convinced that Mahatma Gandhi is responsible for all the problems happening in the country and sets out to kill him. The film starts with Saketh Ram as a very old man and almost immediately goes into flashback. As a young man he is among his friends, in conviviality. He has taken a Bengali wife, Aparna, and everything is wonderful in his life, However the year is 1946, and the imminent independence of India from British suzerainty is complicated by religious antagonism between the Hindu majority and the large Muslim minority, who demand their own independent state. Saketh and Aparna visit Calcutta; rioting is reported, but Saketh goes out to get some food, and he soon encounters a Hindu woman being chased by Muslim rioters. He rescues her, but the rioters later come to his house, and brutally rape and then kill his wife. Saketh is devastated and takes to the streets, determined personally to kill as many Muslims as he can find. He meets up with Sriram Abhiyankar, who is leading a group of Hindu extremists, and Saketh becomes temporarily taken with the cause himself. At the same time, he is persuaded to take a new wife, Mythili, and life begins to stabilize for Saketh after all. However he then falls in with an eminent Maharajah who is leading an underground group with the intention of assassination. Travelling with the Maharajah, Saketh meets one of his old friends from younger days, who has fallen on hard times. Reminiscing, and getting his old friend back on his feet deflect the process of recruiting Saketh, but only temporarily, and soon he is manipulated into committing himself to renouncing his family and his new wife, in the interests of the cause which now is disclosed as the assassination of Gandhi. Although a fellow Hindu, Gandhi was felt by some to be too conciliatory to Muslims and in the logic of extremists, Gandhi became the prime target. Soon Saketh is informed that Gandhi will be in Delhi for some weeks, and that Saketh is to take the opportunity to do ""his duty"". However, hiding from a snap search by the police, he has to hide his pistol on a delivery lorry, and it is driven away to a factory owned by Muslims. Going there hoping to retrieve the gun, he becomes engulfed in a shoot-out between some Hindu attackers and the Muslims, and finds that his loyalties are not so clear cut as he had imagined. Finally he escapes after the death of another of his old friends in the crossfire. The next day, January 30th 1948, he contrives to be near Gandhi in a public prayer ground, his appointment with destiny. But the film still has 20 minutes to run, and the ending is not what you expect.—Hazel Freeman The movie begins at present day with Saketh Ram (Kamal Haasan), an 89-year-old South Indian Brahmin who is dying. The scene reverts back to the past as Saketh remembers the 1940's, when he and his good friend, Amjad Ali Khan (Shahrukh Khan) were archaeologists working together under their boss, Mortimer Wheeler, in Mohanjodaro (Indus River Valley Civilization) in Karachi. Relations are pleasant between the Indians and the English, and Saket and Amjad do not approve of the Partition and the creation of Pakistan. Aparna Sen, Saketh's simple Bengali wife is living in Calcutta in the midst of riots and chaos over the issue of the formation of Pakistan. Saket goes to Calcutta and is swept into the madness. In one instance, Saket saves an innocent Punjabi girl from the hands of a Muslim gang. The Muslims are angered and decide to take revenge; the group is headed by Aparna's tailor, Altaf, who break into Saket's home. They brutally rape and maliciously slit Rani's throat, and the scene, so vividly shot, leaves little for the imagination. This itself turns Saketh Ram maniacal and puts him on a wild killing spree, avenging his wife's disgrace and killing every possible Muslim in sight. On his apparent sortie he comes across a bunch of right-winged Hindu fundamentalists, led by Abhyankar (Atul Kulkarni). Abhyankar preaches him about the need of the Hindus to come together and save their brethren from the Islamists who according to them are mere intruders from across the Khyber.. He soon joins fanatical Hindus and loses sense of himself, falling victim to the chaos and religious hatred around him. He is also urged to marry again and agrees to it reluctantly. Mahatma Gandhi (Naseeruddin Shah) is solely blamed for the division of India and of the two religions. His wrath gets the better of him as he pledges to take revenge co-opted by the Hindutva Brigade and he travels from Calcutta to Madras to kill Mahatma Gandhi. There he meets his second wife (Vasundhara Das) , another light eyed beauty. Saketh Ram does not love her but only marries her under his father's (Kavignar Vaali) orders. Saket Ram is entrusted the task of killing Mahatma Gandhi, after his friend Abhyankar is left paralyzed in a freak accident. He has a change of heart only when he falls prey to a bunch of Muslims, where he also meets old chum Amjad Khan (Shah Rukh Khan), an ardent Gandhi admirer. At the climax, Saketh Ram is prepared to murder Mahatma Gandhi but is stopped by Amjad. He later realizes that without Gandhi, India would be destroyed. He goes up to Gandhi and begs for forgiveness but Gandhi says he has to go and that he has no time for his apologies. When Gandhi is about to leave, a young man approaches and kills Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi with a gun. The movie ends with the old Saketh Ram, slowly dying on his death bed.—Hariharan Saketh Ram comes from a wealthy and educated South Indian family, and is currently touring Karachi, British India, in the company of his businessmen friends, Lalwani, and Amjad Ali Khan. Saketh goes to Calcutta to meet his beloved wife, Aparna. Then religious riots break out, and soon there are Sikh and Hindu gangs killing Muslims on sight, while there are Muslim gangs who kill non-Muslims on sight, as well as rape and molest their women. Unfortunately, Aparna happens to be one of those women. Saketh is enraged, first at the Muslims, then at Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, for advocating peace with the Muslims, and soon he becomes involved with a revolutionary group of right-wing Hindu from Maharashtra who want to assassinate Gandhi. The British leave a bitter and divided India, and Saketh comes home, where his family get him married to Mythili Iyengar. Subsequently, both of them leave, and re-locate to Maharashtra, where they meet with Maharaja, and are soon involved in plotting to assassinate Gandhi. Saketh Ram and Shriram Abhyankar are entrusted with this task, however, Shriram has an accident, is paralyzed, and subsequently dies, leaving Saketh to complete the task of assassinating Mohandas, who will later be known as Mahatma Gandhi.—rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com) The movie begins at present day with Saket Ram (Kamal Hassan), an 89-year-old South Indian Brahmin who is dying. The scene reverts to the past as Saket remembers the 1940s, when he and his good friend, were archaeologists working together under their boss, Mortimer Wheeler, in Mohenjo-daro (Indus Valley Civilization) in Karachi. Relations are pleasant between the Indians and the English, and Saket and Amjad do not approve of Partition and the creation of Pakistan.Aparna Ram (Rani Mukerji), Saket's simple Bengali wife, is a school teacher. She lives in Calcutta in the midst of riots and chaos over the issue of the formation of Pakistan and the call by Mohammad Ali Jinnah for ""Direct Action"". Saket goes to Calcutta and is swept into the madness. In one instance, Saket saves an innocent Sikh girl from the hands of a barbaric Muslim gang. When he returns to his house, he finds a group of Muslims entering his house. They brutally rape and murder Aparna. Saket, unable to cope with his tragic loss, kills the Muslims who raped and killed his wife in a fit of rage.Outside his house, he runs into another Brahmin, Sriram Abhyankar (Atul Kulkarni), who is part of a Hindu militant group determined to fight the Muslims' malice with similar brute force, and assassinate Gandhi for what they perceive to be his treachery towards Hindu dominated India (Gandhi wanted Hindus and Muslims to co-exist peacefully with hope of winning over the hearts of the rioters through sheer self-pity). However, Abhyankar and his fellow extremists had lost patience at what they deemed Mahatma Gandhi's unreasonable stand to appease Pakistan, who had already invaded Kashmir by that time. Gandhi was pressurizing the newly founded Indian state to pay Rs. 62 Crore to Pakistan and some territorial concessions as well.Urged by family to remarry, he weds Mythili (Vasundhara Das). However, on a trip to Maharashtra, he reunites with Abhyankar and becomes a part of his militant organisation that plots to do away with Gandhi. Due to an horse-riding accident, Abhyankar is left a quadriplegic and has Ram swear that he will carry on his work, that of killing the Mahatma.Saket comes to the belief that Mahatma Gandhi (Naseeruddin Shah) is solely responsible for the division of India and of the two religions and also of having supported whom they viewed as the enemy. Hindu fundamentalists, including Saket, are furious and plot to murder Gandhi. However, Saket, after several incidents surrounding and leading to Amjad's death (with whom he reunites briefly in a congested Delhi area), changes his mind about Gandhi. He decides against assassinating the leader, and attempts to beg for forgiveness. Soon afterwards, Gandhi is killed by another assassin, Nathuram Godse. Ironically, Gandhi dies without his famous last words: ""Hey Ram!"" as popularly believed, and as in Richard Attenborough's film Gandhi (film).(Though actual witnesses have denied having heard Gandhi utter those famous last words.)Then on, Saket Ram lives by Gandhian principles. As the 89-year-old Saket Ram is being taken to the hospital, he is told of bomb blasts in the city due to Hindu-Muslim communal riots. He asks ""Innuma(even still)?"". They were forced by the police to be taken into an underground shelter for their security, but Saket Ram dies there. in his funeral gandhis grandson come and see saket private room with full of historical photos. Saket's grandson handed over gandhis footwears and spectacles which Saket collected from place of shoot out and keep like inspirational treasure.Thanks to Wikipedia"

She's the typical American girl - except for one little problem: her personality is split into more slices than a pepperoni pizza. Spoof of 1960s Beach Party/Gidget surfing movies mixed with slasher horror films. Florence Forrest, a not-so-innocent girl in 1960s Malibu, becomes ""Chicklet"", the first girl surfer at Malibu Beach. Only Florence suffers from dissociative identity disorder and, occasionally, her alter ego ""Ann Bowman"", a sexually aggressive, foul-speaking girl, comes out, during which time several beach goers are found murdered. The suspects include Chicklet herself, surfer Kanaka, exchange student Lars, and even Chicklet's own mother.—Matthew Patay Chicklet, a wannabe surf-girl with a split personality, becomes the primary suspect after a string of humorously gruesome murders terrifies the teen set. When the clues take her to the beach, the fun and suspense begin. At the beach, Chicklet crosses paths with burnt-out surf guru Kanaka, dreamy surfboy Starcat, and stylish homicide detective Monica Stark. Psycho Beach Party comes from screenwriter and dragtress extraordinaireCharles Busch. It's an audaciously funny whodunit and psycho thriller parody set on the sun-drenched beaches of '60s Malibu. When pouty-lipped misfit Chicklet, (Lauren Ambrose) finally makes her way into the cool crowd, she begins having insanely bizarre blackouts. At precisely the same time, all of her beefcake surfer pals mysteriously drop like flies and she quickly becomes the chief suspect. A madcap romp filled with shirtless hunks, a wannabe surf babe with a split personality, oh, and a few severed body parts. Robert Lee Kingdirects this wacky, campy fusion of teenage surfer flicks and slasher sagas. Impossibly perky Florence (Lauren Ambrose) doesn't quite fit in at her thoroughly square high school in her seaside Southern California town -- that is, until she happens upon a band of ultra-hip surfer dudes. Renaming herself ""Chicklet,"" she tries her gosh-darnedest to be the sole girl riding the waves with the group led by suave Kanaka (Thomas Gibson). While adopting her surfer alter ego, Florence soon discovers that other less pleasant personalities emerge when confronted with the sight of polka dots. One called Anne Bowman is a tough, ""experienced"" older lady, while the other, Tylene, is a stereotypical sassy black woman. Blacking out whenever these other personalities take over, Florence becomes increasingly worried that she is responsible for a series of grisly murders. Of course, she is far from the only suspicious character in her oceanside community -- there's B-movie star Bettina Barnes (Kimberley Davies), Swedish exchange student Lars (Matt Keeslar), and Florence's own unnervingly-perfect mom (Beth Broderick). This film was adapted from a popular off-Broadway play written byCharles Busch."

However, as there is no conclusive proof, Benezet has to let him go.At the party, a crowd is gossiping, and Chantal Hearst (Monica Bellucci), his wife, has to keep her composure. She will be questioned later, after her husband gives his speech without his wig, to confirm why she and her husband sleep in separate rooms. Little by little, the story each of them tells changes.Hearst first blames Chantal for being jealous. Then, it's discovered he likes cheap very young prostitutes. Hearst says that Chantal and artist Paco Rodríguez (Luis Caballero) are lovers. He's the husband of Chantal's sister María (Jacqueline Duprey). Chantal says that he saw Hearst with her niece Camille (Isabel Algaze) giving her presents and trying to seduce her. Also, she tells that once she saw her husband washing his blood-stained clothes at night.Pressure over Henry increases. Finally, Chantal, the legal owner of the mansion where they live (it was Henry's present), signs a form permitting the police to look for more clear proof. At the dark room, they find the photos of the two murdered girls and many previous snapshots of them. Henry says that it must be Chantal's trap. He doesn't divorce her because she would be entitled to one half of everything and the mansion.Henry gives up. He starts confessing it all. Suddenly, Benezet is interrupted. Another police officer tells him that they have found the real murderer in a car, pestering some other young girl and with the recorded videos kept in his car. Benezet and Owens free Henry.Henry doesn't forgive Chantal for trying to frame him. (At least that's my interpretation of the ending)"

Narrated by one of the children, the film follows the kids as they struggle to balance their own ambitions and relationships against a tragic lie.—Kelly Williams This is a story about some experiences of children in a rural, economically depressed southern town in the United States. George, Buddy, Vernon and Sonya are teens and tweens that hang out together, exploring and playing among the ruins of industrial sites. Vernon finds a leather-bound journal in the debris in one building.The film starts with Buddy and his girlfriend Nasia in a cubby at church, as she breaks up with him. Later, with the other kids playing on a concrete structure nearby, Nasia and George have a conversation.George's uncle Damascus, who has a violence-inducing fear of dogs, quits his job at the train yard over complaints that the company does nothing to curb the threat of wild dogs in the area.George finds a dog sitting in some feces. He tries to clean it up and take care of it.Among the remaining workers at the train-yard are Euless, a preachy health nut, and Rico, the son of the train-yard owner. Near where they are having lunch is Rico's moped and a broken down station wagon. Sonya mounts the bike, and Vernon sits on the car, taunting Rico, who comes over and gives him a noogie. Rico bans Sonya from touching his bike, while he explicitly allows the boys to do so, saying that she already stole one car.Euless and Buddy have a catching-up conversation about how Buddy's mom has trouble sleeping at night. He sings the theme to ""Blazing Saddles"" to her at night to help her nod off.In a house, there are five girls, including Nasia, and an older friend Denise, talking about wanting to get pregnant and rating the local guys. Nasia says there's nobody datable in this town.Vernon and Buddy are sitting on Buddy's porch, and Buddy is upset that Nasia dumped him, and thinks she's going after George.Next day, Euless talks to George, telling him his uncle quit yesterday.

Rico applauds, asking if that was Shakespeare or the Bible. They go for a walk, talking about the town, and Nasia. Rico recounts being dumped by a white girl for someone poor, fat, and ugly. Buddy says he likes his moms friends.We see George using a dry powder shampoo, because of his head condition. An infant's ""soft spot"" is the anterior fontanel, a diamond-shaped area that, since the brain grows faster than bone, allows for human head development, acting as an expansion joint for the frontal and parietal bones. Eventually, that spot and the other sutures surrounding the cranial plates would ossify, or harden into bone. If this doesn't happen, it's called cleidocranial dysostosis. It's often accompanied by many other symptoms, but in George's case, seems to have only affected his skull development. In voiceover, Nasia tells us that George's brain gets irritated if he scratches his head or gets it wet. He carries and often wears a football helmet to protect himself.At night, George and his sister Whitney are in bed. Damascus is in a bath, and Aunt Ruth is asking him to remember the first time they made love to the song that's playing. He asks why she always sounds like she's going to cry. In bed, we learn that their mom died when Whitney was one year old.In church, George and Buddy are chatting about being baptized, and we see a flashback to when George got baptized in the local river. Buddy gets George's assurance that he's not into Nasia.At the public pool, Sonya, Vernon, Buddy, and another boy, Tyler, are playing, while George dangles his feet or scores them on their dives. Tyler is wearing a neck brace, that he said was from hitting a wall while skateboarding.

Sonya is poking poop with a stick, and smearing it on the concrete wall. The other kids tell her to stop, and she ends up getting some on Vernon's shirt. They all go to the bathroom to clean up. Buddy shows George his new wrestling uniform, and says it's too big for him. After urinating, Buddy pantses Vernon, who crawls under a stall to get him back. George pulls Buddy up in a headlock. Buddy pushes George into a wall. George's head, with his helmet on, bangs against it. Everyone is sorry, and calms down for a second. Then George starts things up again by pushing Buddy into Vernon, who pushes him to Sonya, who pushes him back to George. All the while, Buddy's sneakers are squeaking on the wet floor. George pushes him back to Vernon, and Buddy slips and falls, smacking his head on the floor. Buddy says he has a headache, and asks them to call his mom. Then he goes into a stall, picks up a stick, starts beating the wall and yelling, as the blood in his brain leaks out the back of his head. He screams in pain, before collapsing to the floor, dead.Sonya, Vernon, and George are stunned, and are flailing in their minds, trying to think of what to do next.

Rico tries, unsuccessfully, to get people to come to a union meeting.On top of a building, Nasia and George talk. She says she thinks Buddy ran away because he has a crush on her. George says she has nice hands.Sonya finds Vernon sitting in the bathroom where Buddy died. He says some men came by his house asking about Buddy. He's worried about going to prison. He wishes he had his own tropical island, or any way to just get out of there, and is upset that Sonya doesn't show any emotion.George comes home and the dog is gone. He stays up all night listening to Damascus chop wood. He goes for a walk, and Nasia narrates about how she wouldn't have suspected that George knew what he knew about Buddy at that point.George wanders down to the pool, and sees Tyler floating, face down, with nobody around. He makes his way in, and dives in to rescue him. He gets Tyler to safety before his head condition endangers his life.At the hospital, the doctor says he'll be ok as the swelling goes down. Damascus says he's stupid, and that he should have known better, based on what happened at his baptism. George says he just wanted to save Tyler. Damascus says he makes him sick.Tylers mom shows up at George's to say thank you for George saving Tyler's life. Aunt Ruth is just tired.The next day, Aunt Ruth is reading a news article to George about his heroism.

Then George goes to where they left Buddy's body, and brings him to the river where George was baptized, performs a posthumous baptism, and lets Buddy's body float away.After a church service, Denise hops on Ricos bike, and they go make out by the river.

He says they shouldn't talk anymore, because he hasn't got anything to say. Then he's doing push-ups, as Nasia tells us he was always going to be a hero. He wears his helmet, Buddy's wrestling uniform, and a towel as a cape, and directs traffic. Rico tells George that he respects him, and asks if he can join. Then they're both directing traffic.Damascus is handling scraps of George's dog. George has a clipboard, and is making a tally of safety violations in the backyard.We see a preacher at Buddy's, and Nasia tells us that Buddy's mom never let the preacher come inside.George runs fire drills on his sister, with her full participation.Vernon and Sonya are talking by the water, about how George isn't talking to anyone anymore. Vernon tells a story about how Buddy's mom fed him one time when she saw he was hungry, knowing that would mean less for her and Buddy. Sonya asks him to keep a secret, and says she's not a good person, and doesn't think nice thoughts. Vernon says they're all just a little screwed up. She says she didn't cry when Buddy died, and Vernon says that's just how she deals. She says she doesn't have much to look forward to. They make a pact of sorts to escape the town together. They try to steal that station wagon. Sonya distracts boss Rice, and when he runs after her, Vernon tries to start the engine.Uncle Damascus comes in to have a chat with George about the dog.

About Adam,2000,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0199314/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A waitress falls for a handsome customer who seduces her, her two sisters, her brother, and her brother's girlfriend. A waitress meets personable, attractive Adam and they soon become lovers, then get engaged. Wasting no time, Adam starts an affair with her bookish sister, who knows about the first relationship. Their (none-too-happily) married third sister knows about both these liaisons but is still attracted to Adam. The lad is certainly playing the field, but in their own ways the girls seem to be getting just as much out of the deal as him.—Jeremy Perkins {J-26} In Dublin, Ireland, the adult Owens sisters are in different stages of and have different outlooks on romance. The eldest, Alice Rooney, is in a stable if somewhat boring marriage to Martin Rooney, with a baby daughter Jean adding to that stable, traditional family life. Middle sister Laura Owens, an academic, believes it better to have no relationship than to be in one without that fairy-tale passion, much like the romances in literature which she studies. Youngest sister Lucy Owens, an aspiring singer and a waitress at a local bar, goes in and out of relationships easily, she recently just having broken it off with her latest boyfriend Simon, an aspiring stand-up comic, and never yet having had that passionate relationship to which Laura so aspires. Into their collective lives comes Adam, a photographer and gallery owner, who becomes ensconced within their family. Unlike Martin who she doesn't much like, Mrs. Owens would love to see Adam as part of the family. Adam does touch on something primal and different in each of the sisters, one who he does openly embark on in a relationship, that sister unaware of what is happening between him and her sisters. Certain situations involving Adam are presented from the different perspective of each of the sisters. If Adam does end up as part of the family and with which sister and/or if he does have a longer term effect on each of their romantic lives is also affected by David Owens, the sisters' younger brother, who is in a stalled situation sexually with his current girlfriend Karen, and who sees in Adam the ""bro"" he has never had... and perhaps more.—Huggo"

It is many thousand years in the future. Vampires once ruled the night but have seen their numbers reduced by fearless bounty hunters. One such hunter is D, the halfbreed son of a human mother and vampire father. When a girl from a rich family is taken from her home by the vampire Meier Link, her father contracts both D and the Markus brothers (a rival group of hunters) to race to retrieve her. As the heroes fight their way through Meier's hired guards, they begin to suspect that the girl may have gone with him willingly.—Lordship In the far distant future, vampires rule the night. But because of the fearless bounty hunters, their numbers dwindle. One such is D, a half-breed born of a human mother and a vampire father. He is hired by a father-son team to retrieve Charlotte, a lovely young lady, who was abducted by the vampire Meier Link. However, they also hired the Marcus Brothers for competition. In a race against time and across the lands, D and the Brothers fight their way through demons and monsters to save the woman, and slowly begin to suspect that she wasn't taken against her will...and that another threat looms in the distance...—Selestia Fionaire <DragonHeart@the-lair.com> The story takes place 12000 years in the distant future, a future where nuclear war took place, and from the ashes of the Earths remains vampires emerged as a dominant race. Taking the title of Nobles, they enslaved the remnants of humanity and ruled over them with the aid of special magical technology and a race of inhuman creatures. But over time, they slipped into decadence and decau and humanity won their freedom.The film begins with a young maiden, Charlotte Elbourne, being abducted by the Noble Meier Link. Her family calls upon two famous bounty hunters to get her back (preferably alive, but dead if shes been changed into a vampire). One is the Marcus Brothers, the most brutal family of bounty hunters. The other is D, a dhampir (a half-human half-vampire being) who has taken to hunting vampires, who keeps a magical talking parasite in his left hand and bears a stoic demeanor.D meets the Marcus Brothers: the brutal leader Borgoff, the knife-wielding Kyle, the hulking hammer-swinger Nolt, the psychic Grove (though his abilities have left him mortally weak) and their adopted stepsister Leila. While the Marcuses have a head start, Ds Left Hand is able to magically track down Meier to a resting house (however, Borgoff schemes to let D do all the work and get the girl from him afterwards). Meiers carriage sets off with Charlotte inside; D fights Meier but halts when Charlotte calls out to Meier. Leila appears close behind but is injured in the fight; D tends to her wound, and in disgust she snarls at him.Meiers carriage is tracked to the Barbarois, a community of monstrous beings that have served vampires since time immemorial. D enters, and discovers that three guardians have been paid to guard Meier: a shadow-being called Benge, a werewolf named Mashira and a woman named Charlotte who can use her hair like tentacles and absorb elements. Benge uses his ability to surreptitiously kill Nolt, but he manages to warn his brothers before dying; consequently Grove uses his psyche to enter Barbarois and annihilate as many Barbarois as possible. Meiers carriage leaves Barbarois and a pursuing D strikes down Groves spirit, but Benge uses his power to temporarily trap D inside a shadow.The Marcus brothers take off after the carriage, but soon their tank is incapacitated by Caroline. Benge stays behind to deal with them, but thanks to Nolts final warning they are able to kill him. But they still need to get fuel for their tank, so Kyle and Leila head to a nearby town. They find D is also in town, so Leila turns the townsfolk against him to get him out of their hair. But one of them unexpectedly stands up with a gun to defend D, saying D saved his life as a child and hes returning the favour.At a stop, Charlotte steps out to enjoy the sunlight. D meets her and questions her. He learns that shes in love with Meier, and that shed rather die than return home. This revelation disgusts and enrages Leila, who swiftly captures her; however Mashira and Caroline were keeping watch nearby, and attack. Mashira gets Charlotte away, while Caroline engages D and Leila. D manages to stop Caroline temporarily before he is overcome by heat syndrome (as a half-human half-vampire he can endure the sunlight, but every now and then it gets too strong and he must bury himself for a time). Leila helps him bury himself in return for having assisted her, but has to deal with a regenerated Caroline. Fortunately a storm begins, and a lightning bolt strikes Caroline and electrocutes her, ending her permanently.During the storm, Leila has to seek shelter in the same place as D. Although she is harsh towards him, the rain eventually softens her. She shares a bit of her past: her father was killed trying to rescue her mother from being abducted by a vampire, who was turned (and later stoned to death by members of her own village). Filled with rage towards all vampires, she joined the Marcus Brothers to kill them all; shes resigned to this as the only life she will ever have. D, as a dhampir, is a kindhearted soul who is resigned to never having a normal humans life; but he reminds Leila that his fate is sealed, unlike hers. They both make a pact, that whichever of them dies first will have the other put flowers on their grave. As the rain stops, they go back to business rivalry and take off on their separate ways.Borgoff and Kyle work out that Meier is headed for the Castle of Chaythe, a fearsome place avoided by humans and vampires alike. However, to get there the carriage has to cross a bridge, which is where they set up an ambush: they place bombs under the bridge and with this force the carriage to a stop. Mashira seemingly bails out, leaving Meier and Charlotte unprotected. Kyle forces her out, but Meier steps out into the sunlight to save her, burning himself terribly. Charlotte breaks free and runs to save Meier, to the surprise of Borgoff and Kyle (and Leila, who witnesses the bridge from afar); the two of them decide to just let Charlotte die and then kill Meier, since they get paid for her return either dead or alive. But before they do anything, Mashira kills Kyle and cuts out Borgoffs eye; hed gotten away to remove the bombs from underneath the bridge.The surviving Marcuses and D continue the pursuit of Meier and Charlotte, though now its for personal reasons: Borgoff and Leila want to avenge their fallen brethren, and D wants to prevent the possible conception of another dhampir. Mashira stays behind to stall D, and Meier and Charlotte finally reach the Castle. There they greet Carmilla, and their purpose is revealed: aeons ago vampires used to travel into space in rocket ships, to distant worlds. Meier and Charlotte desire this ship to head to the legendary City of Night and Stars, where they can be together without resistance from anyone.However, Carmilla has her own plans. She creates an illusion of D and Charlotte to slice Meiers head in half, a mirage of Nolt and Kyle to trick Borgoff into becoming her vampire servant, a hallucination of a newly-orphaned Leila to throw her off track, and a vision of Meier to lure Charlotte to her tomb to feast on her blood. Borgoff attacks Leila and D, but Grove uses up his last strength to use his spirit to destroy Borgoff. D, unfazed by whatever apparitions Carmilla shows him, makes his way into her tomb, where she has drank enough blood to take on a corporeal body. She causes Ds vampire instincts to surface and he is almost overcome, but Meier puts himself back together in time for the two to team up, and eventually Carmillas body is destroyed and her spirit swallowed by Left Hand.However, it is too late for Charlotte, who was drained of blood beyond recovery. She and Meier have one last moment of love before she passes away. Meier decides to carry on his journey with Charlotte by his side, but D proposes to take her body back to her family. The two fight, but eventually D settles for taking Charlottes ring as proof of her death. Meier and Charlotte leave in the rocket ship, with D and Leila watching. Leila has been inspired by the dream the two lovers had: having lost her family a second time and seeing that vampires can love just as humans can, she decides to start a new life, a life away from hatred and vengeance.The film ends many decades later, as a family holds a funeral for their beloved matriarch Leila. Her granddaughter sees D watching from a distance, and comes to invite him home (times have changed since, as vampires or at least only D are held in better regard). He declines, saying he only came to keep a pact with an old friend, but says hes glad she was able to make a life and family for herself. He gives the girl a thankful smile, before he rides away..."

The Gangster is eager to please; his violence impresses Mays and he proves his loyalty with creative methods of murder. However, the Gangster from the start is obsessed with and jealous of Mays' success and glamorous lifestyle, demonstrated in his luxury clothing and plush flat. The Gangster discovers that Mays' rival, Lennie Taylor, is planning to kill Mays. Instead of warning him, the Gangster decides to let the attack take place, and kills the only other member of his gang who is aware of the plan. The Gangster watches as Taylor and his gang shoot and stab Mays, and slit the throat of his fiancee, Karen. Later that night, the Gangster goes to Taylor's flat, shoots him in the leg and tortures him to death. The Gangster discovers the following day that Mays did not die but was hospitalized. Mays is unjustly convicted of ordering Taylor's murder and sent to prison for 30 years. With Mays out of the way, the Gangster assumes leadership of the gang and consolidates his position. In a sequence spanning the years between 1968 and 1999, he is shown organizing a bank heist, opening a casino, fixing horse races, and building his gang to over 300. The narrative returns to the aged Gangster at the boxing event, where he discovers that Karen also survived and is due to marry Mays, who has left prison a changed man. The Gangster summons Mays to his old flat, which the Gangster took over. The Gangster, seeking to resolve any threat and his own demons, offers Mays money and the flat. However, Mays seemingly has no fight left in him, wanting only to marry Karen and retire in peace. The Gangster threatens Mays with a gun, then gives Mays the gun, confesses his silence over the attempted murder and Taylor's death and begs Mays to kill him; Mays leaves, acknowledging how empty and pathetic the Gangster's life is. The film closes with the Gangster, having apparently lost his mind, committing suicide by stepping off the top of a building. His last words: ""I'm number one""."

Werckmeister Harmonies,2000,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0249241/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A naive young man witnesses an escalation of violence in his small hometown following the arrival of a mysterious circus attraction. This story takes place in a small town on the Hungarian Plain. In a provincial town, which is surrounded with nothing else but frost. It is bitterly cold weather - without snow. Even in this bewildered cold hundreds of people are standing around the circus trailer, which is put up in the main square, to see - as the outcome of their wait - the chief attraction, the stuffed carcass of a real whale. The people are coming from everywhere. From the neighboring settlings, even from quite far away parts of the country. They are following this clumsy monster as a dumb, faceless, rag-wearing crowd. This strange state of affairs - the appearance of the foreigners, the extreme frost - disturbs the order of the small town. Aambitious personages of the story feel they can take advantage of this situation. The tension growing to the unbearable is brought to explosion by the figure of the Prince, who is pretending facelessness. Even his mere appearance is enough to break loose destructive emotions...—Anonymous The story takes place in Hungary, shortly after WWII. Events center around young János Valuska. Trustworthy, caring and respectful, János enjoys a modest yet peaceful existence with his close knit, extended family. Undaunted by cosmic events that will soon overshadow the whole community, the artistically inspired János directs and narrates a performance for a motley crew of intoxicated misfits in a local bar. Shortly thereafter, a new exhibit featuring a great whale and a foreign prince arrives in town. Apparently, this public display has already caused much commotion in neighboring towns, and once again trouble appears to be brewing. Aunt Tünde tries to organize a committee to restore order. Uncle György, a reclusive reactionary, wants nothing to do with this 'media circus', but in order to avoid confronting his wife directly, he reluctantly agrees to be the chairman. János goes to see the whale and eventually realizes that the exhibit is indeed a diabolical threat to the community, but he still does not understand how or why. Events reach a frightening climax when a mob of angry citizens ransack a hospital. When all the smoke and debris has finally settled, János is left even more clueless than he had been to start. The film insinuates that the Soviets deliberately provoked social unrest in Hungary so as to provide context for a justifiable military takeover. Those who naively cooperated with the Soviets became puppets. Others who opposed the Soviets were either killed or ostracized. The big 'fish out of water' represents the elite members of Hungarian society, who were rendered utterly powerless and useless.—Anonymous Werckmeister Harmonies is an allegory of the post WWII Eastern European political systems told as a b&w filmmatic poem with 37 long single camera shots.The film was made post the end of the cold war in Hungary 2000 it is based on a 1989 book ""The Melancholy of Resistance"" written during the time of the iron curtain by László Krasznahorkai. It examines the brutalisation of a society its political systems and dogmas through the metaphor of a decaying circus whale and its star performer. It is set in a desolate, isolated small town in Hungary during Soviet times.The film starts with János Valuska, a simple citizen, conducting a poem and dance with drunken bar patrons. The dance is of the total eclipse of the sun, which disturbs than silences the animals, but it finishes with the grand return of the warm sunlight.A reoccurring theme is the transitions from darkness to light. In the opening scene the light represent the warm sun of self determination which transitions to the people thrown out through a door in to the dark of night. The circus arrives like a Trojan Horse in the darkness of night. There is a wonderful poetic scene were the lead character walks in and out of the shadows .The film is in b&wHis uncle György is a composer, and therefore one of the elite. György observes the imperfection and compromise of the musical scale (as defined by Andreas Werckmeister a historical theorist). György proposes changes to the scale to make it more harmonious. György's utopian approach to music represents a flawed naive idealism that never can be achieved, it is not developed any further in the film or the book. It is just a statement that human governance will always be flawed. A less cryptic name for the film might be The Inevitably Flawed Paradox of Human Governance but that would destroy the enigma that this film is. It is an acknowledgement even when light of self government comes there will still be flaws because we are human.György's estranged wife tries to leverage her political and social status by giving György a list of names to sign up for the ""clean up the town movement"", this with the blessing of the police chief.However a stuffed smelly circus whale and its star performer, Prince, comes to town this is used a metaphor for a bloated political system and the unseen Prince who represents the power of politically inspired, emotive dogma.János philosophises about God and the beast (each viewer will interpret this differently).The post office workers are unsettled by the ominous disturbing signs of the circuses arrival and are disturbed by the cloud that settles over each town it visits (a reference to the spread of the externally imposed centralised monolithic government system onto the Soviet buffer nations, just after the war).György's struggling cobbler brother gets the list and passes it on to the agitated throbbing masses in the town square who are unhappy at public services failing.György's former wife sleeps with the drunk gun toting chief.The presence of the whale and the Prince stir up the masses.
János overhears the circus master losing control of his faceless Prince, who is becoming drunk with his own voice of revolutionary dogma. The circus master disowns him. The Prince, now free, inflames the masses.The people riot.The film is shot as a beautiful but disturbing visual poem. Long single shot scenes with a hypnotic and rhythmetic pace build up to the disconnected yet peaceful observation of the thuggish destruction of the hospital and its patents and the brutal inhumanity of the rioters, which almost seems normal and natural. You almost become one of the rioters as you get swept up in this pointless crowd-think not knowing or caring where it is going. Social upheaval does not always need a reason.When the rioters finally come to beating a helpless old naked patent they see their impotent sad and powerless selves. The sick helpless patents in the hospital are a mirror of the rioters themselves.After the riot János comes across the diary of a rioter it explains that the rioters did not know what they were angry with; so they were angry at everything, than it recounts the mobs horrendous rape of two working class post office girls.János comes across his killed cobbler uncle who got naively involved in the riot. János is told, by his cobbler uncles wife, to leave town for his own safety.He is intercepted by a helicopter. He finds himself committed to a mental institution with caged beds (a tool of the time for dealing with political dissidents). János appears drugged and broken.György his composer uncle is evicted from their society house but gets to live in a shed in the garden whilst György's former wife, with her new status as a collaborator, now occupies the big house with the police chief. The intelligentsia is displaced by political opportunism.György tells a vacant János, in the ward, that IF he is released from the mental institution they can live contentedly together in the shed with his piano, János just stares.It finishes with György looking directly into the eye of the whale than, walking away and looking back at the now sad and dishevelled whale, destroyed by the rioters the night before, its rotting carcass slowly enveloped by the fog which gets whiter and brighter.The camera pans up as warm bright sunlight returns............The director worked closely with the author. The book looks at the myopic petty interpersonal effects at roots of the situation however the film instead examines the overview of the forest. Like the film the book has paragraphs a chapter long. It spends 5 pages on a decaying corpse but not that of the whale.Gerard Hosier"

While Ed and his sons take the money, they still will not let Will off the hook. Will finally strikes an agreement with the men wherein he will come to a motel room and ""perform"" for them, allowing himself to be taken advantage of again, and they will give him all of the copies of the tape.However, Will secretly plans to ambush and murder all of them with the help of Syd, who purchases two pistols from the local drug dealer named Tuott the Basehead (Jason Mewes).When the time comes, Will finds himself unable to kill his three tormentors. Just as Ed and his sons move in to rape and murder Will, Ed's son Frankie accidentally shoots himself in the face with Will's gun. Then, a shootout ensues with another (unnamed) lowlife at the motel, who breaks into the room to rob them. Both the bum and Ed's other son (Gino) shoot each other to death. Ed panics, and Will chases him through the motel parking lot to a nearby playground. As Will approaches him to shoot him, Ed drops dead of a massive heart attack. His conscience clear, Will retrieves the tape and gives it to Syd to destroy to cover up his past. In the free and clear, Will then goes back to hosting his childrens television show."

Together, Brigitte and Ginger decide to kidnap Trina's dog that night, and imply that the Beast of Bailey Downs killed it.They set out and find the mutilated corpse of another dog. They decide to take it with them to convince Trina it is actually her dog, but, as they pick it up, a leg comes off in Brigitte's hand. Brigitte notices blood on Ginger, thinking it is from the dog, but it proves to be from Ginger's first period. The Beast of Bailey Downs attacks, and drags her into the woods screaming. Brigitte rescues Ginger. As the sisters flee, they narrowly escape being hit by an approaching van driven by Sam (Kris Lemche), which hits and kills the Beast. Brigitte finds Ginger's wounds are already healing and begs her to go to a hospital. Ginger refuses, as she does not want their mother (Mimi Rogers) to find out. After a few days, Ginger begins to grow hair from her wounds, sprouts a tail and menstruates heavily. A rift forms between the sisters after Ginger smokes marijuana with Jason, and aggressively pursues him. Ignoring Brigitte's warnings, she has unprotected sex with Jason, then kills a neighbour's dog.Frightened by what is happening to Ginger, Brigitte turns to Sam. Agreeing the Beast of Bailey Downs is a lycanthrope, he suggests a pure silver ring may cure Ginger. Brigitte persuades Ginger to have her navel pierced using the ring, but it is ineffective.Later, Trina goes to the Fitzgerald house claiming Ginger kidnapped her dog. As Ginger and Trina fight, Trina slips, hitting her head on the corner of the kitchen counter, and dies. The sisters panic, narrowly avoiding their parents seeing them as they put the body in the freezer, explaining the blood to be part of another series of death photos for the school project. Brigitte later accidentally breaks off two of Trina's fingers trying to get the corpse from the freezer. As they take Trina's body to bury it, they lose the fingers. Brigitte tells Ginger she cannot go out anymore, but Ginger remains defiant.On the pretence that Brigitte is the one ""changing"" instead of Ginger, they visit Sam, who suggests a monkshood solution for Ginger's illness; and informs them that the monkshood grows everywhere, however it only grows during spring. Ginger angrily tells him that they have no time, and accuses him of just wanting to have sex with Brigitte before storming out.On Halloween, Brigitte takes her mother's monkshood, which was purchased from a craft store, and asks Sam to make the cure. Sam warns her asks if it is for Ginger. Brigitte admits the truth, and promises to go to the Greenhouse Bash party.While trying to track down Ginger, Brigitte is attacked by Jason (whom Ginger infected through unprotected sex) and she defends herself by using the cure on him. She witnesses his immediate change in behavior, which proves the cure's success.Ginger returns to school looking for Jason. As Brigitte arrives, a message on the PA asks her to go to the Guidance office. She knocks, and is dragged inside by Ginger who has killed the counselor. Brigitte calms Ginger down, and goes to find cleaning supplies, but returns to see the janitor with his throat torn open. He survives, though infected, until Brigitte says he should have gotten help, which incites Ginger to disembowel him with her hand.The sisters' mother discovers Trina's corpse, and goes looking for her daughters. While she is looking for her daughters, she sees Brigitte running, and picks her up. As she drives Brigitte to the Greenhouse Bash, she tells her that she will burn the house down by letting it fill up with gas then lighting a match to erase evidence of Trina's death, and their escape. Brigitte arrives to find Sam rejecting Ginger's advances. As he approaches Ginger, she breaks his arm. In despair, Brigitte infects herself as Sam pleads with her not to. As the sisters leave, Sam knocks Ginger out with a shovel. Brigitte and Sam then take her back to the Fitzgerald house in his van, and prepare more of the cure for Ginger.Ginger fully transforms into a werewolf on the way home and escapes the van. Afraid, and unaware she has transformed, Sam and Brigitte hide in the pantry, and he makes the solution. As he goes to find Ginger, Ginger-Wolf mutilates Sam. Brigitte picks up the dropped syringe, and follows the blood trail downstairs. She tries to drink Sam's blood in an attempt to calm Ginger-Wolf, but chokes on it. Ginger-Wolf senses Brigitte's insincerity and kills Sam in front of her, then leaps at Brigitte. As Ginger-Wolf stalks Brigitte through the basement, Brigitte returns to the room where they grew up, finding the knife that Ginger had been using to remove her tail. Brigitte holds the cure in one hand and the knife in the other. Brigitte is told to leave but refuses, only to infuriate Ginger-Wolf, resulting in Ginger-Wolf lunging at Brigitte who stabs her with the knife, instead of the cure. As the movie ends, Brigitte lays her head upon Ginger-Wolf, sobbing, listening until its breathing finally stops."

Forty-two students, three days, one deserted Island: welcome to Battle Royale. A group of ninth-grade students from a Japanese high school has been forced by legislation to compete in a Battle Royale. The students are sent off to kill one another in a no-holds-barred game to the death, until one survives--or they all die.

They are kidnapped and forced onto an isolated island, where each is equipped with food, water, a map, and a random weapon. On the island, they must compete in a violent death-match game until only one victor remains. Failure to follow the rules or participate in the death match results in death by an exploding collar that each one must wear.—Artificial_Lifeform The story opens with a frantic news broadcast about a young girl being brought back to mainland Japan after she wins the latest ""Battle Royale"", a contest that pits high school students against each other in a fight to the death on a remote island. While being filmed, the girl smiles.Shuya Nanahara, a Japanese middle school student, attempts to cope with life after his father's suicide by hanging. Meanwhile, schoolmate Noriko Nakagawa is the only student attending class -- 3-B. Their teacher, Kitano, quietly leaves upon her tardy, apologetic arrival, but is attacked by student Yoshitoki Kuninobu and resigns after recovering from his wound.One year later, class 3-B takes a field trip after completing their compulsory studies; however, the class is gassed on their bus. They wake up in a ""briefing room"" on a remote island, wearing strange electronic collars. Kitano explains that the class has been chosen to participate in this year's Battle Royale as a result of the BR Act, which was passed after 800,000 students walked out of school. The orientation video cheerfully instructs the class to kill each other for three days until only one student remains. Students resistant to their rules or entering one of the randomly placed ""death zones"" for each day are to be killed by the collar's detonation. One of the 42 students, Fumiyo Fujiyoshi, interferes with the video by whispering to her friends; Kitano kills her on the spot with a thrown knife. While a shocked class is subdued by soldiers, Kuninobu openly confronts the viciousness of Kitano and the teacher slashes him with a knife (in the back of leg - the same area Kuninobu attacked Kitano two years earlier) before detonating his collar while Shuya, his best friend, watches in horror. Each student is provided a bag of food and water, map of the island, compass, and one item containing either a lethal weapon (firearm, kama (sickle), knife, potassium cyanide) or an item apparently worthless toward survival (paper fan, binoculars, coat hanger, saucepan lid). The weapons are supposed to eliminate any natural advantage any one student might have over the others.The program's first six hours see twelve deaths, four of which are suicides. Brazen, mute ""exchange student"" Kazuo Kiriyama and quietly deranged classmate Mitsuko Souma soon become the most dangerous players in the game, while another exchange student, Shogo Kawada seems somewhat more merciful. Shuya promises to keep Noriko safe for Kuninobu because he was in love with her, but never told her. Other students have various goals in the game: Shinji Mimura and his friends plot to hack into the military's computer systems and destroy their base of operations; Hiroki Sugimura searches for his best friend Takako Chigusa and his love interest Kayoko Kotohiki. Chigusa runs into Kazushi Niida, who is sexually obsessed with her; Chigusa kills him after he attempts forcing himself on her, but is herself killed by Mitsuko. Kawada teams with Shuya and Noriko, and reveals that he won a previous Battle Royale at the cost of his girlfriend, Keiko; he now swears vengeance. The trio are forced to separate when Kiriyama attacks, and Sugimura rescues Shuya, assisted by his assigned ""weapon,"" a GPS tracking device.Shuya awakens bandaged by Yukie Utsumi in the island's lighthouse, where she helps reorient him to the events of the past 14 hours; five other girls on the school's cheerleading squad have also been guarding and hiding out in the building, apparently since the beginning of the program. Utsumi gathers the girls around the dining table to weigh in on a possible method of escape from the island which Shuya has informed her of. Yuko Sakaki, thinking that Shuya murdered a friend of hers, attempts to poison Shuya's food, but it is inadvertently eaten by one of the girls, killing her and sparking a massive, fear-fueled gunfight resulting in all the girls' deaths -- except Yuko. She realises the enormity of her paranoia and commits suicide, jumping from the deck of the lighthouse.Shuya returns to Noriko and Kawada, and they set out to find Mimura's group. To a small warehouse, Sugimura tracks down Kotohiki, who panics and kills him shortly after; Sugimura professes his love before dying. Kotohiki cries in despair, and is found and killed by Mitsuko. Watching from the rafters, Kiriyama then guns down and kills Mitsuko after she sadly dispenses some fitting advice to her two (dead) classmates.Upon the rapidly-consecutive deaths of Sugimura, Kotohiki and Souma, all of the seven students remaining are either preparing or willing to completely subvert the operations of the ""game"" - save for the psychopathic Kazuo. ""The Third Man"", a hacker group consisting of Mimura, Iijima and Yutaka, successfully infiltrate the military's computer system and prepare to destroy the perimeter using a truck converted into a fire-bomb. However, at the last second they are found by Kiriyama, who kills them all, but one of them manages to detonate the truck, seriously injuring the killer. When Kawada, Noriko and Shuya arrive at the hackers' burning base, Kawada confronts and kills the shrapnel-blinded, Uzi-armed Kiriyama with his SPAS-12 shotgun.On the morning of the final day, Kawada, aware of the collars' internal microphones, takes Shuya and Noriko aside and fakes their deaths. Suspecting that Kawada has won through manipulation of the BR system, Kitano ends the game and dismisses the troops before establishing final protocol, intent on personally killing the young man. Kitano realizes that Kawada, and not Mimura, has hacked into the game's intranet system months beforehand, and has now disabled Shuya and Noriko's tracking devices. Kitano unveils a homemade painting of the dead students, with Noriko indicated as the winner. He reveals that he was unable to bear the mutual hatred between him and his students, having been rejected by his daughter, Shiori. He also confesses that he always thought of Noriko as a daughter. He asks the confused, reluctant Noriko to kill him, but is quickly shot by Shuya after he threatens her at gunpoint. As he falls, Kitano shoots, and it is shown that the weapon in his hand was a mere water-gun. Suddenly, his phone rings, and Kitano sits down to answer it, telling Shiori that ""if you hate someone, you take the consequences"" before finally dying. Shuya, Noriko and Kawada leave the island on a boat, but Kawada dies from injuries sustained in his gunfight with Kiriyama -- ""glad"" that in the end, he ""found true friends.""Shuya and Noriko are declared fugitive murderers, and last seen on the run in the direction of Tokyo's Shibuya train station."

He never sees her. Waking up in the morning, panties are all that's left of her. How does he find her in a building with 100 girls? This sexy, teen-comedy is about a freshman, Matthew, at college who meets his dream girl in a dorm elevator during a blackout. He never sees her face, but instantly falls in love. In the morning, the power is restored, but the ""dream girl"" has vanished. All Matthew knows is that she lives in an all-girls dorm. He sets out on a semester-long journey to find his mystery girl amongst a hundred female suspects. Could it be Wendy? Dora? Arlene? Patty? Cynthia? Or the 95 other girls, any of whom could have been in that elevator with Matthew.—Anonymous After leaving a party at a women's dormitory (aka the ""virgin vault""), Matthew (Jonathan Tucker) is trapped in an elevator with an unknown, and unseen, woman when the power goes out. Matthew and this unknown woman have sex in the dark. When Matthew wakes up in the morning still in the elevator he finds himself alone with a pair of her panties.On a mission to find his mystery maiden by finding a matching bra for the panties, Matthew becomes the maintenance boy of the virgin vault. He releases mice and goes room to room setting traps. He convinces the panicked women to leave the room and then starts to look for a match. This does not prove successful, and he continues to break things (such as the air conditioning) in an effort to find his woman. He also fixes the television set, which is greatly received by women he refers to as ""Jane-ites,"" as they have a great interest in movies adapted from books by Jane Austen. He doesn't get much help from his roommate Rod (James DeBello), who keeps telling him to give up, and together they philosophize about men and women. Rod tells him that he doesn't need a girlfriend and that it's futile to try to find the ""matching bra the panties,"" and Matthew accuses him of being too machismo. Rod introduces Matthew to his adopted idea of ""penile power"" that he uses to try to increase the size of his penis. We later find out that he does this, as well as the dissing of women entirely, as a ploy to try to make himself feel better about the problem he has with his manhood.Early on, he watches as a woman named Patty (Emmanuelle Chriqui) and her boyfriend Crick fight. Crick is the epitome of the macho man stereotype, with his big pectorals, conceited attitude, and abusiveness. He wears a pony-tail, a manicured goatee, ""male make-up,"" and chews nicotine gum, much to Matthew's dismay. Matthew tries to save Patty, but is hurt by Crick. Crick leaves and Patty tries to help Matthew, but Matthew can't help but think of how Patty's reputation has been.While searching one room, Matthew finds himself trapped in the bathroom when the occupant returns. Matthew is attacked by Wendy (Larisa Oleynik), until she recognizes him as a high school classmate. Wendy decides to help Matthew in his quest to find his mystery maiden. Later we learn that she is also looking for a woman because she is a closet lesbian.Along his quest, we learn of his nervousness he has had to talk to girls. He gets scrutinized by Arlene (Katherine Heigl) and his teacher Ms. Stern (Aimee Graham) about how females are more dominant than males are. Arlene undermines him and beats him at fooseball and Ms. Stern preaches about how the female gender is more dominant and should be in command, rather than males. Rod even tells Matthew that he's a chicken and should just give up on girls, while Matthew tells him that he has never been able to speak to girls, especially Cynthia (Jaime Pressly).In addition to searching by hand, Matthew puts an advertisement in the school newspaper to meet him in the basement on a Thursday night. He ends up sitting in the dark every Thursday night just waiting for her to show up. The door opens one night and he thinks it's her, but it turns out it's just Wendy coming to check up on him. Then, one night, the mystery maiden shows up, only to tell him to stop looking for her.Despite the end of the semester approaching Matthew isn't detered and disguises himself in drag to keep searching. In drag, he is actually able to talk to Cynthia one-on-one which, otherwise (until she is injured later on) he is not able to do because of her looks. He also gets checked up by Rod, who claims to the regular Matthew that he had sex with Matthew's drag character, for which makes Matthew so mad he adds a higher weight onto Rod's ""penile power,"" hurting him there. Crick makes a pass at Matthew in drag as well when he is fighting with Patty, and Matthew ends up biting part of his tongue off as a result, making Crick unable to speak.Desperation has set in, and so Matthew appeals to his mystery maiden by proclaiming his love for her to the whole dormitory. Afterwards he determines his mystery maiden is Patty the same one he's had sex with since the elevator incident. She initially rejects him because she thinks that he only sees her as some slut. Crick sees that Matthew wants Patty, but Matthew says that he'll have him arrested for sexually assaulting him. Not too much later on, Patty warms to Matthew after he tells of his undying love for her.In the end, Arlene and Wendy end up together, and Rod and Dora, intentionally put in the same situation as Matthew was in by Matthew himself, end up together as well. Cynthia shows off her newly found martial arts abilities, and Ms. Stern learns a valuable lesson on gender equality, as Matthew stands up to her in front of the class, to a unanimous ovation."

This fluid granted immortality to anyone who consumed it. The Arakacians built an empire and enslaved the known universe for centuries; they were unstoppable. The Arakacians were finally vanquished after the fountain chamber (where they gathered the water of life) was sealed by freedom fighters. The key to the chamber, a glowing crystal that will lead the bearer back to the fountain, but would drive anyone who possessed it insane, was cast into space and lost among the stars.In a present-day asteroid excavation, space miner Tyler and his colleague found the key by accident. Tyler touches the key to the fountain chamber and instantly goes insane.

Joint Security Area,2000,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0260991/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"After a shooting incident at the North-South Korean border DMZ leaves two North Korean soldiers dead, a neutral Swiss and Swedish team investigates what actually happened. In the DMZ separating North and South Korea, two North Korean soldiers have been killed, supposedly by one South Korean soldier. But the 11 bullets found in the bodies, together with the 5 remaining rounds in the assassin's magazine, amount to 16 cartridges for a gun that should normally hold 15. The investigating Swiss/Swedish team from the neutral countries overseeing the DMZ suspects that another, unknown party was involved - all of which points to some sort of cover up. The truth is much simpler and much more tragic.—serious cinephile <catpaw@cityline.ru> After a shootout at the common security area at the border of the two Koreas, when two soldiers were murdered, Maj. Sophie E. Jean is assigned by the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission to investigate the incident. The smart Major finds lack of consistency in the statements of the survivors, and in spite of being pressed by her superior, she interviews South Koreans Sgt. Lee Soo-hyeok and private Nam Sung-shik, and the North Korean Sgt. Oh Kyeong-pil, disclosing a tragic story of friendship.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Two North Korean soldiers are killed in the DMZ at a North Korean border house, before Sergeant Lee Soo-hyeok (Lee Byung-hun), a South Korean soldier on border duties, attempts to flee back to the South Korean side. The southern troops rescue him while the gunfire erupts and, two days later, the fragile relationship between the two Koreas depends on a special investigation conducted by Swiss Army Major Sophie E. Jean (Lee Young-ae) on behalf of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission.As Sergeant Lee Soo-hyeok has confessed to the shootings, Sophie investigates why the two Koreas have contradicting accounts of events; Soo-hyeok's states he was knocked out and kidnapped while relieving himself and, waking tied up in the North Korean border house, secretly freed himself and shot three North Korean soldiers, leaving two dead. The North Korean survivor Sergeant Oh Kyeong-pil (Song Kang-ho) states that Soo-hyeok barged into the border house and shot everyone before retreating when the wounded Kyeong-pil returned fire.The autopsy report shows that one NK soldier, Jeong Woo-jin (Shin Ha-kyun), was shot eight times repeatedly, indicating a grudge was held; additionally, a single bullet is not accounted for. Over the course of the investigation, witness Private First Class Nam Sung-shik (Kim Tae-woo) attempts suicide by jumping out of the window of the interrogation room and a strange emotional reaction between Kyeong-pil and Soo-hyeok during a meeting causes Sophie to confirm her suspicions that the surviving soldiers and Woo-jin held a mutual friendship and were attempting to protect one another.Explained through flashbacks it is shown that Soo-hyeok was on patrol with other soldiers, only to get lost on the North Korean side and to partially trip a mine. Found by Kyeong-pil and Woo-jin, the two North Koreans deactivate the mine, which later prompts Soo-hyeok to throw written messages over the border to maintain contact with his two new friends. Eventually inviting Soo-hyeok across the border, the three become a group of friends that soon includes Sung-shik, with the four agreeing to leave politics out of their friendship so to remain loyal to their own respective countries.As tensions rise between the North and South, Soo-hyeok and Sung-shik return to the North through the Joint Security Area to say goodbye and celebrate Woo-jin's birthday, only to be discovered by a commanding officer from the North and resulting in a Mexican Standoff. Despite Woo-jin panicking and betraying his friends, Kyeong-pil convinces Woo-jin, Soo-hyeok and the officer to lower their weapons, only for Sung-shik to panic and shoot the commanding officer when he reaches for his radio; when Woo-jin draws his gun again, Sung-shik shoots him, and in a daze shoots his corpse several times. Earlier in their friendship when Soo-hyeok is joking around with his gun, Kyeong-pil asked Soo-hyeok if he'd ever had to kill a man like he's had to, implying that Soo-hyeok doesn't know what it's like. Kyeong-pil slaps Sung-shik out of his daze, takes the gun from him and kills the still-alive officer, then persuades Sung-shik and Woo-jin to flee with a false alibi of being kidnapped, before throwing away the evidence that he and Woo-jin were fraternizing with Southern soldiers. After shooting Kyeong-pil in the shoulder to complete the alibi, Soo-hyeok and Sung-shik flee across the border, with the former getting past unseen; as Soo-hyeok's wounded leg from the firefight prevents him from running, he is the only soldier seen and picked up by soldiers.Sophie is eventually removed from the case when it's discovered that her father, a former POW, had North Korean ties during the Korean War, thus technically making her a non-neutral. Before leaving, she attempts to informally learn of the true events first with Kyeong-pil and then Soo-hyeok. Having asked Kyeong-pil if he had a message for Soo-hyeok, Sophie gives Soo-hyeok the lighter he first gave to Kyeong-pil. Before saying goodbye and wishing him well, she reveals that Kyeong-pil told her that he saw Soo-hyeok's gun actually shot Woo-jin first during the chaos before Sung-shik shot him. On his way out, Soo-hyeok steals an officer's pistol and commits suicide out of guilt for Woo-jin's death and Sung-shik's suicide attempt.The film concludes with an American tourist's photograph of the joint security area that accidentally contains all four soldiers prior to the incident."

Waking up from his fantasy, Henry boards the train with Jimmy.Henry works at a local magazine company called 'Bruiser'. While at the office, everyone is at a conference meeting deciding on which model should be on the magazine's latest issue. The vile and reprehensible boss, Miles Styles (Peter Stormare), mocks Henry's choice in front of him and his co-workers. Later that day, Henry talks with Miles' wife Rosie (Leslie Hope), who works at the magazine as the lead photographer, and there appears to be an attraction between them as she is the only person who is casually nice to Henry.Later that afternoon while playing indoor tennis at a local country club with Jimmy, Henry tells his friend that he cannot get a platinum credit card for his assets are coming up short, and his wife is spending his money faster than he makes it. Jimmy convinces Henry that this is only a temporary setback and that profits will come in sooner or later.That weekend on Saturday, there is a pool party for the workers at Miles and Rosie's house. The cynical Janine goes off not wanting to speak to the weak-willed Henry, who is sitting for a plaster mold to be made of his face by Rosie whom also designs masks in her spare time. Rosie finishes the mask and adds it to her ""garden of lost souls"" in the backyard. She asks Henry to paint a design on the featureless mask, but Henry cannot think of anything to draw. Henry sees Miles and his wife across the pool in a very intimate moment.While driving home later that evening, Henry confronts Janine about what he saw as her making the moves onto his boss. Incredibly, Janine hardly seems to care and she tells the distraught Henry that he is so weak-willed and a pushover, she despises living with him and firmly wishes that he were dead. Janine tells Henry: ""You're going no place! You're nothing! You're nobody!"" When they arrive home, Henry then has another fantasy about Janine pulling the car into the garage, and him getting out and killing her with an ax to her head. Janine gets back into the car and drives off into the night, leaving Henry all alone.After drinking all night at his house, Henry awakes up the next morning on Sunday and goes though his daily routine, only when he goes to the bathroom mirror to shave, he is shocked when he sees a white-faceless, porcelain mask staring at him. Henry's entire face has inexplicably transformed into a faceless image. When Henry tries removing the ""mask"" he cuts himself. Henry hides when Katie, his once-a-week maid, arrives to clean the house. Henry watches the maid as she fills her purse and bag with silver and other items from his house. When Katie begins taking cash out of Henry's wallet that is left on a counter, Henry reveals himself and confronts his kleptomaniac maid about stealing from him. When Katie admits that she has been pilfering items for weeks now from his house just because she wants to, Henry attacks and beats her to death with the bag filled with stolen silver items. He wraps the body up in plastic and hides again when Janine comes home. Henry overhears a phone conversation in which Janine tells the person on the other line that she is going to leave Henry.Henry follows his wife to the vacant office where it is revealed that she and his boss, Miles, are having an affair. But it is Rosie who catches them first by bursting into a conference room and photographing Miles and Janine having sex on the conference table. When Miles chases his wife out of the building where Rosie tells Miles that she intends to leave him, Henry sneaks into the conference room where he reveals his new blank face for his wife. When Janine expresses no remorse for cheating on Henry, he attacks her by wrapping her neck around an extension cord and pushes her out a window where she hangs to death. Henry is spotted by a co-worker, named Tom, where Henry threatens Tom to stay silent about him ever being there.Outside the building, Miles is distraught over his wife leaving him and of Janine's death. While giving a statement to Detective McCleary (Tom Atkins) whom is the first policeman on the scene, Henry eludes the police and goes home. He hides from the cops again when they come to his front door to look for him to deliver the news of his wife's murder. After Henry finally has had enough of Janine's barking dog, he throws the dog into his refrigerator. While looking through his business files, he discovers that his friend, Jimmy, has more than likely been taking Henry's money for himself. After making it appear that he possibly killed himself and disposes of the maid's body by burying it in the back of his house, Henry phones Rosie and tells her not to go out of her house because he overheard the police who think that she might have killed Janine.That afternoon, Henry visits Jimmy at the tennis club where he points a gun at Jimmy in the deserted locker room and reveals the business papers which show that Jimmy has been pilfering money out of Henry's bank accounts and mutual funds for years now. Jimmy tells Henry that it was Janine's idea to steal Henry's money so she could squander it for herself. Jimmy reveals that Janine has been cheating on Henry with him too. Jimmy offers to write Henry a check for the entire amount of $30,000, but Henry politely refuses. Then, Jimmy suddenly breaks character by pulling out a gun from his briefcase and tries to kill Henry. Henry fires back, fatally wounding Jimmy in the chest. With his last breath, Jimmy (just like Henry's wife Janine, and the housekeeper Katie), expresses no guilt for his betrayal. Henry hides Jimmy's dead body in the trunk of his car and pushes it into the nearby lake.That evening, Henry goes to Tom's house where he spies on Tom in a hot tub with Gloria, another co-worker at Bruiser where Tom confides in Gloria about witnessing Henry murder his wife, but that he feels sympathetic to Henry for all of the abuse and mistreatment Henry received and wants to protect him from the police. Henry, who is about to shoot Tom to prevent him from talking, changes his mind and quietly leaves, satisfied that he can trust Tom.The next day, still in the featureless mask, Henry goes to visit Rosie at her home to tell her whats been up lately. (""I've been working on my image"".) After he leaves, Henry calls 'The Larry Case Show', a popular radio program, and tells the host that he is 'Faceless' and has murdered three people. After listening to some advice by Larry Case, Henry decides that he needs to eradicate all the people from his life if he is to get his face back.The following night, Henry goes to attend Miles' costume party, dressed as Zorro wearing a white mask which he blends in perfectly. Rosie is also there who is being tailed by Detective McCleary whom still thinks that she either killed Janine, or had it done. Henry, with a little of Tom's help, assembles a group of men from the office where they take Miles away to a second floor balcony where Henry tells his mean and ungrateful boss that he has set him up for a grand finale. With the crowd of party-goers underneath, Miles is raised overhead on wires. Henry aims a strong laser at Miles (intended for exploding the heads of confetti-filled dummies), and kills him, while the crowd cheers, thinking it is simply part of the concert floor show. As Henry walks away, he removes his black cape costume and hat, and his face suddenly returns to normal. Henry realizes that he has his face back when someone walks by and calls his name out. But he is also spotted by Detective McCleary who moves in to apprehend him for the killings. However, Rosie shows up in the Zorro costume with a white mask on and yells at McCleary that she's the killer. Rosie tells Henry that she made a plaster of her own face and it was blank, just like Henry's. Now that his revenge is complete, he has his face back and he can start a new life for himself. Henry is then lost in the crowd and McCleary cannot get to him. Henry bids Rosie farewell and escapes into the crowd.Some time later, a long-haired Henry is now working as an office messenger boy in another city. Henry passes by an office where an angry and loathsome executive is yelling at several people. After the man screams at the overly curious Henry, who walks by, the mean executive tells him to come back to his office for he has a job for him. ""Coming sir"", says Henry in an angry tone who turns around... and his blank, anonymous, faceless white mask has returned."

During one such fight, Anuradha intervenes and tries Shyam to sign the Non-Objection Certificate, so that she could have the job at the bank. When Shyam refuses, Raju makes a plot to make him sign the papers. Shyam eventually finds out that Raju made him sign the papers and that is when the rivalry between the two commences. An old friend of Shyam's, Khadak Singh (Om Puri) comes to Shyam's place asking to return his money so that he can marry off his sister and afford the dowry.Shyam finds out that Raju has been deceiving his mother by posing as an engineer and creates an uncomfortable situation for Raju as he calls his mother fake while being inebriated. Raju retaliates, saying he just wants to see his dying mother happy and nothing else. He will do anything for his mother. This is one of the dramatic moments in the film. Anuradha prepares a job resignation meanwhile and gives it to Shyam, who in return tears it up because of her mentally ailing mother and the debts to be paid to the debtors.Their life takes an unexpected turn when they get a call from Kabeera (Gulshan Grover) which is a wrong number actually meant for the owner of Star fisheries, Mr. Devi Prasad (Kulbhushan Kharbanda). The wrong number is because of the misprint in the phone directory, which renders Star fisheries' number as Star garage's and vice versa. Kabeera, a terrorist cum kidnapper, tells who he thinks is Devi Prasad that his granddaughter is kidnapped and asks for ransom. Raju overhears the entire conversation going between Kabeera and Shyam and decides to play a game.The game involves Shyam calling Devi Prasad posing as the kidnappers and asking for double the ransom amount. This will make their monetary problems disappear. Shyam and Baburao initially repel the idea and try to go the faithful way. But Raju in turn convinces them that even though wrong, this is a golden chance to earn money. Both relent and phone the real Devi Prasad and ask for double ransom. Their first attempt gets foiled, by the police and Kabeera informs them that the ransom has been doubled. They phone Devi Prasad again. This time they ask for a foolproof double ransom.They reveal their true identities to Devi Prasad to win his confidence and try to save the girl from the kidnappers. But the girl recognizes Shyam as an imposter and Kabeera gets alerted. A huge fight involving the police, Kabeera's gang members and Khadak Singh's men, infuriated by the delay in the money return intervene the fight, takes place. The scenes are hilariously choreographed, especially those involving Baburao losing his spectacles and accidentally firing an AK-47 all over the floor. The girl is saved by the three and returned to Devi Prasad. Baburao and Shyam go home happily intending to find Raju with the money, but they find him missing. They call the police and Raju is found to be gone to return the money of the debtors.In the end, Devi Prasad comes to the trio's rescue and convinces the police that it was all a misunderstanding and saves the three and they go home, richer than ever."
The Libertine,2000,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0214878/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The 'philosopher' (modernist intellectual of the French 18th-century Enlightenment) Denis Diderot is part of an aristocratic circle which practices the libertarian principles on the rural castle estate of the baron of Holbach, and prints their forbidden publication, the Encyclopédie, drowning the noise of the presses in Jewish assistant Abraham's organ playing. Then arrives Madame Therbouche, a flirtatious painter, from the Prussian metropolis Berlin, and convinces Diderot to pose for her more daring then his idol fellow-philosopher Voltaire in Berlin: in the nude, leading to an animated row with his wife Antoinette, still naked except for a very unsteady sheet, all over the estate's park. Worse, the saucy scene is witnessed by a feared visitor, Holbach's brother the Cardinal, who is hunting for the illegal Encyclopaedia printers; to divert him, the baroness confesses her real and imagined sins since years and next sends in every female to do the same, later joined spontaneously by chevalier (marquis in the end credits) de Jerfeuil, who got a livelier show the he bargained for when accepting to be shown two inseparable marquis's 'sabre collection' which proves not of the military variety. The baroness also treats her guests to (then) most exotic foods and naughty pictures, yet even for her the freedman Turkish hamam eunuch Mohamed takes hospitality for female guests too far into intimate massage to their taste. His personal experience keeps changing Diderot's ideas, and therefore the article he is writing on 'morale' (morality). Secrets end up getting out, both the portraitist's true agenda and what goes on in the chapel, which the Cardinal finally gets into to 'recollect himself' after hearing so many unsettling lustful sins...—KGF Vissers"

Blood: The Last Vampire,2000,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0275230/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Saya is a Japanese vampire slayer whose next mission is in a high school on a US military base in 1960s Japan, where she poses as a student. She uses a katana/samurai sword to kill vampires. In Japan, the vampire-hunter Saya, who is a powerful original, is sent by her liaison with the government, David, posed as a teenage student to the Yokota High School on the eve of Halloween to hunt down vampires. Saya asks David to give a new katana to her. Soon she saves the school nurse Makiho Amano from two vampires disguised of classmates and Makiho witnesses her fight against the powerful demons.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Japan, 1966. Saya is part of a secret team destroying daemons. She is sent undercover as a student at the Yokota Air Base in Fussa-shi, Tokyo, just before Halloween. She discovers that two of her classmates are vampires in disguise just as they are preparing to attack the school nurse; meanwhile, her colleagues have discovered another vampire acting as a bartender in the local red-light district. A spectacular battle ensues.—Jon Reeves <jreeves@imdb.com> The year is 1966. Saya is the only remaining original
vampire, and she hunts Chiropterrans--demons who live off human blood.
Saya's a testy and demanding little bitch but apparently very valuable to
""the top."" Her next assignment, as her boss David explains it to her, is
to infiltrate the U.S. Yokota Air Base's High School, which has been the
scene of several deaths in the past and is thought to be harboring at
least two Chiropterrans. Saya's cover is that of a student who will be
participating in classes for a few days.Saya's first day at Yokota High is pretty uneventful. After classes
are over and everyone has cleared out, Saya snoops around the school and
learns that blood has been spilled on the floor in the infirmary. She
suspects that the infirmary is the Chiropterrans' feeding room. The next
day is the school's Halloween party. After school lets out, the students
change into their costumes and head for the dance...all except for Sharon
and Linda, that is. Linda isn't feeling well, and Sharon thinks it's a
flare-up of Linda's anemia, so she's going to walk Linda over to the
infirmary and they will attend the party later. Saya enters the infirmary
just as Sharon and Linda are about to feed on nurse Makiho Amano. Linda
changes her form into Chiropterran, and Saya slays her with her sword.
Saya turns on Sharon and wounds her, but Sharon gets away, spilling blood
as she flees. The astonished nurse follows the trail, which leads to the
dance hall where she finds Sharon in Chiropterran form hiding under a
blanket. While Saya battles the creature, Makiho runs for help.Meanwhile, at a nearby bar, the mama-san sets the bar on fire, takes
Chiropterran form, and heads for the army base. She kills the military
guard who is escorting the Makiho back to the dance. Saya saves the
terrified nurse, and they take refuge in a military garage, but the demon
finds them. Saya, without her sword, battles the creature with a shovel
while Makiho hops in a jeep and rams through the door. David, who has been
looking for Saya and was standing outside the garage, tosses a sword to
Saya, and she chops the demon (Sharon) in half. As Saya and David take
Makiho from the jeep and lay her unconscious form gently in the grass, they see the mama-san in demon form on the roof, preparing to fly away.
David and Saya follow in the jeep. The Chiropterran tries to escape by landing
on the wing of a military jet tooling down the runway. The jeep gives chase,
and Saya slays the monster. As the Chiropterran lies dying on the runway,
Saya feeds it with a few drops of her own blood.Epilogue: Makiho attempts to describe what she saw to the military brass, but
she has little proof of anything. When she returned to the infirmary,
Linda's body was no longer there and the bloody mess had been cleaned up.
The military brass deny knowing anything about David, but they do show
Makiho a photo taken in 1892 that clearly shows Saya and has the word
""Vampire"" written on it. Makiho returns to her office, wondering to
herself whether Saya is still around and still fighting demons, ""just as
we humans continue to kill each other."" At that moment, an announcement
comes over the radio that the Liberation Front has attacked the American
Blake base and that Yokota base personnel have been ordered to fly to Don
Hoi in North Vietnam. As the credits roll, the background shows some very
blurry photos of what looks like American forces in Vietnam.

Akiki met the Sadako's governess, who stated that Sadako doesn't have any pictures, and that she was a very pretty girl, she also told a story about Sadako's warn for the students who was going to go to the sea for camping, stated that they would die if they go there, and it was later reported that the students did die.Miyaji then begun searching for information from Sadako's therapist, who claims that Sadako was a normal girl and refused to help. Meanwhile, Sadako herself joins an acting troupe as a form of therapy as advised by her therapist. Sadako remains quiet and keeps to herself causing other troupe members to hate her as she creeps them out. But other members of the acting troupe, saw that she has talent in acting. At the time, another girl ( who had been mean to Sadako ) played the main role in the troupe's play. The lead actress then suffers a horribly death by an unknown person dressed in white . As the result, Sadako receievs the main role ( which suits her nice and quiet personality). Soon enough, Sadako falls in love with one of the members of the troupe, Hiroshi Toyama (Seiichi Tanabe). She is continually tormented by her own psychic abilities and the hatred from members of her troupe. Some troupe members then experience the same dream where they saw a well and an old house everyday and blamed it all on Sadako's presence. And they also experienced added supernatural activities.

Miyaji then replied that this was never meant for an article, as she seeks revenge for her fiancé . At the opening day of the troupe's play, one of Toyama's co-workers is able to help Miyaji in playing the recording of the ESP demonstration. Upon hearing this while on stage, Sadako remembered that day. Sadako sees the ghosts of all the dead reporter from the event, pointing at her, along with her mother's ghost (or hallucination) standing afar with a gently smile. Sadako's mother is seen trying to tell her something, but disappeared before she could say it.

Nothing is what it seems. Young Nathan Corrigan has just been released from prison, he who was serving a sentence for auto theft. He is basically a good but misguided person, due in part to the company he keeps, namely the friends he's known since high school and his partners in crime, Leo and Dennis, and feeling unloved or unaccepted by his preacher father, Martin Corrigan. The feeling associated with that latter sentiment is strengthened when his mother, Maddy Corrigan, confesses to him that Martin is not his biological father, that person being who was then a law student named Callum Crane with who she had a one time liaison and who she never told about the pregnancy. Nathan decides to search for Callum. Meanwhile, Callum is now married and a high powered lawyer, whose colleagues in the know consider amoral and devious. Just before he is appointed a federal judge, Callum rapes Sophie Lennon, a secretary new to the law firm where he works. Because of that situation, Callum has Sophie fired. Feeling otherwise helpless in the situation, Sophie threatens to expose what Callum did unless he gives up his judgeship, she unable to stomach the thought that he would be overseeing rape cases. Based on the event surrounding their auspicious initial meeting, Callum, who wants Sophie just to go away, ends up asking Nathan to kill her, not knowing that his and Nathan's encounter was not by chance and that he is Nathan's biological father. Callum hands Nathan a sealed envelope with a $5,000 retainer and the identity of the person he wants killed, the remaining $25,000 payment only if the hit is carried out. Nathan decides not even to open the envelope. In addition to not knowing about being Nathan's father, Callum is also unaware that Nathan has become friends - Nathan's hope is to be more than just friends - with Sophie through a chance meeting through Sophie's roommate, Tanya Duncan, who in turn is attracted to Nathan herself.

All three now live in Moscow, where Ilya Setevoy (Kirill Pirogov) is a programmer at a history museum, Konstantin (Kostya) Gromov (Alexander Dyachenko) works in security for a bank.After the interview, the friends retire to a bathhouse where Kostya reveals that his twin brother, Dmitry Gromov, is an ice hockey player for the Chicago Blackhawks and is being blackmailed by American kingpin Richard Mennis (Gary Houston). According to Konstantin, Dmitry once played for his home club he was invited by the NHL and emigrated to the United States. After he moved, the Ukrainian mafia moved in on him, demanding protection money. Dmitry (also portrayed by Alexander Dyachenko in a dual role) was desperate and appealed to Mennis for protection. Mennis took him under contract, but it left Dmitry as an indentured servant as all proceeds are paid to Mennis. Konstantin informs that Mennis has come to Moscow to meet his employer, Valentin Belkin (Sergey Makovetsky) to discuss a business proposal.In Priozersk, Danila's brother Viktor (Viktor Sukhorukov) watches the interview with their mother.

After the bathhouse, Danila meets up and begins an affair with pop singer Irina Saltykova (playing herself), who he met at the TV station.The next morning, Kostya approaches Belkin and pleads to remind Mennis about his brother. Belkin agrees, but Dmitry Gromov is of little concern to both of them. Belkin, being a Russian kingpin himself, wishes to cooperate with Mennis to legalize their assets. That evening, Danila stops at Kostya's apartment to discover him shot dead.After being briefly arrested and getting into a fight in jail, Danila and Ilya begin planning their revenge in the museum. On the black market, they purchase a CD with personal information about Belkin. They also purchase guns from a neo-Nazi friend of Ilya's. Meanwhile, Viktor has arrived in Moscow and manages to find find Danila in the museum, where he agrees to join their plans, and helps them steal a car.As it is the start of the school year of September 1, the gymnasium where Belkin's son Fedya is studying is holding its opening ceremonies. Arriving at the school in the stolen car, Danila introduces himself as Fedya's new teacher and invites Belkin to the staff-room for a private conversation. He confronts Belkin at gunpoint and interrogates him about Kostya's murder. Belkin reveals that it was not his doing, but that of Mennis. Danila leaves Belkin after he pleads for his life.The trio clear the museum, and Danila gives Ilya his remaining money to procure passports and tickets to Chicago. It is revealed that Kostya's murder was due to a misunderstanding, as he only wanted him fired. However, the stunt in the school now threatens his whole operation with Mennis. Belkin's thugs and his police contacts begin to search the city for Danila. Danila decides to lay low at Saltykova's apartment and brings Viktor with him. Meanwhile, Belkin's thugs discover the stolen car in the building's parking lot. Saltykova's chauffeur Boris warns Danila, and the Bagrov brothers ambush the mobsters and then lead them on a chase through the town and into a closed alley, where they make quick work of the thugs. News of Bagrov's success concern Belkin's partners, who begin doubting the security of their operation. Learning of the bought tickets under Bagrov's name, Belkin alerts the Ukrainian mafia in Chicago.To avoid capture, the brothers fly to America separately, and Viktor arrives in Chicago without any suspicion. Danila instead takes a flight to New York City where he arrives in Brighton Beach. There, he buys a cheap car to travel to Chicago by road, but it breaks down along the Pennsylvania Turnpike. Stranded, he hitches a ride to Chicago with trucker Ben Johnson (Ray Toler). Despite Danila's limited English, the two become close friends and on his way to Chicago, Ben shows Danila much about American life. Upon their arrival in Chicago, Ben drives by prostitutes, one of whom, Marylin, turns out to be a Russian named Dasha (Darya Urgens Lesnikova).Back in Moscow, Belkin is still determined to catch Danila, but a background check revealed that Viktor was on board the flight to Chicago. Paranoid, Belkin alerts the Ukrainian mafia in Chicago to find him. Meanwhile, Viktor arrives to the Ukrainian district in Chicago. Danila attempts to meet up with Dmitry and Viktor, but is unable to make contact with them. Badly needing a translator, he decides to find Dasha and travels to the neighborhood where she works. Just before he can run away with her, he is savagely beaten by Dasha's pimp's henchmen. The Police let him go on the basis of recognizance and he gets revenge by tricking the same group into selling him weapons, which he steals by subterfuge. Afterwards, Dasha's pimp attempts to get even with her but is in turn killed by Danila, leaving Dasha no choice but to go with him.Danila and Dasha finally meet up with Viktor and the three enjoy an evening campfire on the beach of Lake Michigan where they share their experiences and attitude towards American society. Dasha tells her story of how she came in the early 1990s as an exchange student, worked in escort service in New York before finally degrading into a street hooker. Viktor, on the other hand, is much too impressed with the power of money that drives America. Danila instead shows his patriotism and offers Dasha to come back home with them, replying to her ""what will I do there?"" with the ""What have you achieved here?"" inferring to her social status. As for Viktor, Danila reminds him there are things that money can't buy. This philosophical discussion is broken by a homeless black man, who stumbles across them and is insulted when Danila called him a negr (not knowing that the word is an insult in English). While waiting for a fight to come, Dasha replies that she believes that the aggressive primal nature of black people drives fear into white people, thus making them ultimately superior. This theory fails its test, when Danila's warning shots into the sand quickly forces the attackers to flee.Regardless, Danila finally begins to move in against Mennis and first hits his front, the Club Metro. Expecting Mennis to be there he sneaks a weapon into the toilet, and during a Rock concert that evening, involving the Bi-2 band, he kills every member of Mennis' mafia he encounters in the basement. Mennis, alas, is absent. Viktor, himself picked up a tail by the Ukrainian mafia, draws them away and kills their hit-man, but not before learning of the mafia's operations and headquarters. The next morning Danila climbs 50 or so floors on a skyscraper's fire escape to reach Mennis' office. He finds him in a game of chess. Killing his colleague, he finally confronts him alone. As if continuing the debate on the lakeside, in his monologue (in Russian) he asks the American if power really comes from money. Arguing that his brother (whose photo is lying next to the chess table) believes this theory, Danila instead thinks that power lies in the Truth. He (implying Mennis), can be rich, but not strong, as his money he stole from someone else. Thus the tricked person is right, so he is stronger. Almost weeping in fear, Mennis agrees. In conclusion, he demands all of the money he took from Dmitry to be returned.Giving Dmitry his money, Danila sets off back home to Moscow driving through the Ukrainian neighborhood he witnesses a police siege around the former headquarters of the Ukrainian mafia, where Viktor killed everyone inside. As he is dragged out handcuffed, Viktor shouts his intentions to stay in America. The film ends with Danila and Dasha taking off to Moscow, and the final call to Irina is not intercepted, as presumably, Belkin is also removed by his ""investors"", who in an earlier scene, face to face told him, that the sum of money he set up in this operation is too much to be risked. At the airport, Dasha is told that she will never be able to enter the United States again due to the expiry of her visa, but she does not care, signaling an intention she will never come back."

One day Ranjeet asks Badal to drop Soni to college. Badal finds that 4 goons harass Soni daily. Soni doesn't trust Badal and asks him to leave.

The Calling,2000,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0218067/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A woman is used as a pawn to bring to fruition the rule of the Antichrist. On her wedding night, a young woman conceives a child during a hallucinatory encounter. Several years later, as her friends and family begin to behave strangely, she pieces together clues that lead to one conclusion, her son is the Antichrist.—mista005 The movies opens with an American girl, Kristie [Laura Harris] being shot at the ocean shore and falling into the surf. She awakens in the hospital and Father Mulin [Peter Waddington] is with her. He asks if she wishes to be forgiven; initially unable to speak, she squeezes his hand. She then tells the story in flashback. After a fairy tale romance and wedding, she marries dashing Englishman Marc St. Clair [Richard Lintern]. The wedding occurs on a full moon, which he tells her is perfect for fertility and is no chance; it was the result of years of planning. He takes her to a dark and windy outcropping of rock. She is frightened and wants to go back, but he begins kissing her and she becomes faint. As she passes out, her wedding dress is pushed up and a man is making love to her; she sees his bare chest, which covered with scars. Kristie becomes pregnant and gives birth to a beautiful dark haired son, Dylan [Alec Roe-Brown]. Coincidental with Dylan's delivery, the 6 year old son of the TV station owner is shown being led into a dark place, where he touches a Bible embossed with an inverted cross; he is later found murdered. There are flashes of the same runes that Kristie saw on the stones. After a difficult delivery, Dylan is born healthy and his idyllic childhood is shown in glimpses of home videos, where they live on the Isle of Man. In a bathtub scene, young Dylan is seen wearing a crucifix, which is giving him a red rash; Marc removes it. In another scene, Dylan quits playing card game concentration because it is too easy.Later, Kristie becomes concerned about Dylan's increasingly violent behavior, which includes the impaling of his pet guinea pig on a stake and his annoyance at her saving a friend of his from an impending accident on the playground. Kristie cannot understand how her son, who she had focused so much energy and love on since he was born, could have turned out to be so heartless.Meanwhile, Elizabeth Plummer [Alice Krige], the wife of the TV station owner and whose son as murdered the night Dylan was born, is trying to replace Kristie and keep her away from Marc and Dylan as often as possible. She sabotages Kristie's trip home on Christmas and strands Kristie at an airport so she can come and spend Christmas with Marc (whom she kisses) and Dylan. Elizabeth and Marc take Dylan to the room with a large inverted wooden cross. After looking at the cross, Dylan says, ""Youre not my father,"" and Marc says, ""No, Im not.""On the road to the house from the airport, a strange cab driver (who we later learn is named Carmac) begins telling Kristie that 2,000 years after the birth of Jesus Christ, suppose the devil wants to have a turn and he also needs a virgin, but that, like God, he doesn't tell the woman in advance. He then calls Kristie by name, telling her it has already happened and only Kristie can stop him. Surprised that he cab driver knows her name, Kristie demands to be let out of the cab.Kristie arrives at home to be told that the family dog has bitten Dylan; Marc demands it be put down, or he will do it himself. Kristie takes the dog, purporting to have it put down, but plans to avoid this fate. She takes the dog to the home of a friend, Lynnette, only to find Lynnette murdered, bleeding and hung in a plastic bag. Returning home, Kristie finds Dylan is completely apathetic. Kristie then receives a phone call from the veterinarian, saying the dog had been to sleep (at Marcs instructions).Carmac [Francis Magee] then appears unexpectedly when Kristie is at a cemetery. He introduces himself and reminds her about he told her about the Virgin Mary; No one ever told her. ""Its time someone told you,"" he says. Carmac then departs and Kristie finds he has left her a business card and a rock (Amber) with Celtic writing on parchment in it, wrapped in a distinctive cloth. She meets with a university professor who explains some of the words and who offers to take a closer look. Kristie looks up at the TV to see that Marc had brought Dylan as a guest on his TV show. Dylan demonstrates that he can talk backwards. Kristie abruptly leaves the pub and a man stares at the screen while Dylan talks backwards. Kristie confronts Marc, Elizabeth and Dylan at his office. They all claim Kristie knew he would be on the show, while Kristie denies even knowing that Dylan could talk backwards.The movies cuts to the professor's lab where says he has made a discovery. He tries to telephone Kristie but the phone goes dead and his office lights go out. He walks into a classroom to find a woman spray painting on a blackboard; the man from the pub also appears behind the professor and says, ""We heard the calling.""After dinner with Marc at a restaurant, Kristie is awakened by knocking at the door. She goes downstairs and looks through the peep hole to see the professor. She opens the door and the man from the pub (and later, the professor's office) is standing there, holding the professor's decapitated head. Kristie faints and the man steps back, holding the head up to Dylan's window; Dylan gestures to the man to be silent.In the next scene, Kristie is in a parked car with Dylan. She asks if the dog really bit Dylan; he is silent. She asks if Dylan's father did anything to hurt him; Dylan replies that she doesn't know his father. Just then, the woman who had been spray-painting in the university classroom commits suicide by falling from a water tower, where she lands on the windshield of Kristies car. Dylan takes from her dead hand the amber with the Celtic parchment, wrapped in the cloth as Carmac had left it for Kristie at the cemetery.Kristie then calls on Carmac to get more answers. She gives him the amber and asks him what it means. She asks how she can save her son. He hands her a Bible and tells her there is another book, of which the parchment is a fragment; and that she ""got pregnant on your wedding night, and certainly not by your husband."" Carmac tells her that on the day Dylan was born, Marc killed his first born son (Sammy Plummer, the station owner's son) and that Dylan is not Marc's son. At night, Kristie goes to the TV station to review the tapes of Marc's reporting of Sammy's death, here she learns that Sammy's heart was cut out (contrary to what Marc had told her earlier). Marc unexpectedly comes to the station and discovers Kristie reviewing the tape of his report. He denies her accusation that Sammy was his son; Kristie accuses him of lying and flees the station with Dylan in the car. Dylan tries to stop Kristie and the car crashes. Kristie brings the unconscious Dylan to a church and asks the reverend [Roger Brierly] to baptize him. The reverend goes to call the police. While he is gone, Dylan awakens. Sunlight begins to shine through the church's stained glass windows and on the statues. Dylan screams in pain, just as the police arrive with Marc, who takes Dylan away.The movie cuts to Kristie in her hospital bed. She tells Father Mulin that the false prophet, who is the mouthpiece of the Antichrist, is television, with its reporting of news. The movie returns to the flashback, where Kristie says that everyone on the island believes she is ""mad."" Kristie tries to make amends with Marc, but Dylan starts throwing stones at her and Marc tells her to leave. Kristie recounts that Marc filed for sole custody of Dylan. Despondent and feeling that everything seemed to be her fault, Kristie packs and decides to return to the states when, on her way out, she sees Lynette's earring on the ground of her property. Another flashback shows Lynette discovering Marc and Elizabeth nailing a willing Dylan upside down to the large cross previously shown in an earlier scene. Lynnette tries to flee but is caught and killed by Marc. Kristie tries to convince the police to investigate to no avail.She decides to go to the masked ball birthday party for Dylan being hosted by Elizabeth Plummer and her husband. She finds it is a black mass orgy. Dylan stares as a chain holding a fluorescent light over a hot tub; at the stroke of midnight, the chain breaks and the light falls into the hot tub, electrocuting a man in the hot tub, who had previously been fondling two bare-breasted women. Everyone applauds Dylan's accomplishment. It is later revealed the man is Elizabeth's husband, Jack Plummer.Kristie flees and is met by Carmac, who drives her to the beach. He tells Kristie she has to drown Dylan because they have inverted the sacraments. Armed with a rifle, Carmac and Kristie enter the Plummer mansion. They find everyone asleep, including Marc, with Elizabeth lying in his arms. They take Dylan to the shore, where Carmac tells Kristie that she alone must drown Dylan. She starts to carry him into the water and tries to drown him in the surf, reciting the Hail Mary. She wavers and Carmac enters the water and helps her. Kristie stands up in the water and faces the beach, where the coven members are assembled, with Elizabeth standing by Marc's side. Marc points a shotgun at Kristie and fires.The movie resumes with the priest in Kristie's hospital room, asking why the coven waited until Kristie had finished and why they wanted the Antichrist dead. The priest asks for Kristie's confession, and she says she has nothing to confess. The priest tells her she is asking too much and leaves the hospital.The movie cuts to a live newscast of Dylan's funeral procession, which Kristie watches on TV from her hospital bed. It turns out to be Easter Sunday. The priest officiating at the funeral discusses Christ's resurrection. The camera pans the mourners and Kristie sees Carmac. Carmac's voice-over mentions ""the rules of the game."" During the ceremony a dark storm occurs and a raven sits on a tombstone. The earth shakes and people seek shelter, except for Carmac, who tears open his shirt and stretches out his arms to the storm. Kristie sees the same scars on Carmac's chest that she remembers from having sex on her wedding night, and Carmac is revealed to be Dylan's father. It is further revealed that the coven members were all gathered around Kristie and Carmac for the occasion. The storm subsides and Dylan is found to be alive in his coffin, pounding on the inside for release, despite being pronounced dead three days ago. On TV, Dylan says to his mother that he is not mad at her any more and he needs her. She says ""go to hell"" to the TV and Dylan apparently hears her, because he looks at one of the mourners, who then goes to the hospital intending to shoot Kristie. However, she has fled in a car driven by Father Mullin. Meanwhile, the TV talks of the event as being a ""resurrection"" and that the Vatican is getting involved.As they drive away, Father Mullin removes his collar, kisses it, and throws it out the window of the moving car. It is picked up by a man on a motorcycle who is following them--the same man that came to Kristie's door with the professor's head. It is unclear whether Father Mullin discarded his collar because, as Kristie says to him, it is a ""new time,"" or whether he did so to aid the man in following them."

A portrait of the one of our greatest social reformer of our times - Ambedkar. The film documents the period between 1901 and 1956. The film delves more into Ambedkar's life as a reformer, while his personal life is sort of skimmed over. Ambedkar who is the first graduate of his community, the untouchables, is an unassuming young man. All he is concerned about, even when he goes to New York for further studies is that he's here to study, not get involved in political issues and rallies. His exchanges with Afro-Americans, his teachers who support Human Rights and the inclusion of the 14th Amendment in the US Constitution granting rights to African-Americans however rouse the reformer in him. While India is fighting against the British rule on the political level spear-headed by Mahatma Gandhi, Ambedkar wages a social battle against the Upper Caste Hindus. Ambedkar and Gandhi clash in their ideologies. Yet Gandhi admires Ambedkar and it is on his insistence that Ambedkar is made the first Law Minister in Prime Minister, Nehru's rule. The film ends on the note of salvation - where Ambedkar gives millions of untouchables an alternate religion where they find dignity, compassion and equality. He publicly renounces Hinduism and adopts Buddhism.—Sujit R. Varma"

When Priya finds out about the trick, she rushes to Vijay's home to admonish him for his cheap behaviour. But it turns out that Manohar and 7 Times really escaped from prison and stabbed Vijay after a fight. When Priya realises that Vijay is really wounded and attempts to help, she slips and goes into labour. Vijay manages to drive Priya to the hospital despite his condition. Priya gives birth to a baby boy, while Vijay is operated upon and manages to recover. In the end, Vijay and Priya reunite again. Vishwanathan and Priya's mother come to the hospital and sees their baby. Vishwanathan tells that their baby looks like he and their baby will be with him. But, Priya's mother refuses to give the baby as it is her grandchild also and they too argue.

Kogoro thanks the Detective Boys for saving his daughter, and they felt great about it.At the police station, the police are questioning Tomonari. He reveals that he wasn't approaching to Ran.

Kogoro is now worried about Ran. In Tropical Land, the culprit later attacks Ran but Professor Agasa protected Ran and got shot. Conan, who did not come, hurries and rushes to her aid. Conan quickly arrives at Tropical Land, and the culprit gives chase.When the culprit later pins them down to a volcano, Conan reveals his deduction, and also reveals the culprit was the psychiatrist, Kyosuke Kazato, who killed Jinno as revenge for having injured his hands to ruin his promising career, then kept killing to cover his leads, which is why he wants Ran dead, as she managed to witness his last murder AND see his face clearly despite his efforts.

Years later the case was reopened and Dr. Kazato killed all the people on the case. However Ran witnessed one of the murders and saw him. She had then gotten amnesia as an effect of blaming herself for the murder. Dr. Kazato then was assigned to take care of Ran. He began to target her. Conan realized this and saved her from getting run over by a train.Following Dr. Kazato's arrest, Chief Superintendent Odagiri orders his son to be taken into custody for being an accomplice to Tamotsu in smuggling and selling the drug from the hospital that Tamotsu worked.Ran tells Conan the line her dad told her mom he said to tell her that he loved her, leaving Conan (Shinichi) saying that he can't believe he used the same pick-up line as that stupid old man (Kogoro)."

The King Is Dancing,2000,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0244173/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Corbiau repeats the Farinelli formula, artistic rivalry and social private drama expressed in dazzling, sometimes excessively lavish baroque scenery, music and costume, but this time in its ultimate setting: Versailles. There are two protagonists - first the title character, Louis XIV, the French sun-king who has two passions, establishing absolute rule over the realm -after decades of religious/civil wars- by divine right and artistic brilliancy as a dancer (like Nero wrote and performed musical poetry), and starts asserting himself against the entourage of his Medici mother, the regent during his minority, by building his palace complex and launching a 'fitting' new, mainly musical display of baroque show. Secondly the musical genius Gianbattista Lulli ('Jean-Baptiste') Lully, a Florentine upstart of unbridled ambition, quickly gains the king's absolute trust, despite the nationalist and aristocratic opposition to a low-born Italian, and thus turns the normally socially humble post of court composer into a 'ministerial portfolio of culture' of Cabinet rank, complete with a monopoly which kills of his artistic rivals in operatic theater. The script also weaves a complex web of court scheming for individual power and social interests, and even a sadistic but accidental murder on a young valet, producing a sensuous and sumptuous drama too complex for this format, ending in a freakish but fatal accident. Louis XIV's mother was Ana de Austria (in French, Anne d' Autriche), the daughter of one of the Hapsburgh Kings of Spain. Maria di Medici (in French, Marie de Médicis) was his grandmother, his father's mother. She was dead before Louis XIV reached the throne.

Ganga agrees to everything his new-found family wants him to do, and then visitors from the past come to visit Ganga, and place him in a dilemma that will change his way of thinking forever.—rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com) Gangaram alias Ganga (Govinda) lives a simple, straightforward life in a small village with his mom and dad (Shivaji Satham and Reema Lagoo), and his girlfriend, Saavni (Sonali Bendre) and friend Sannata (Kishore Nandlaskar). Village lout Iqbal (Nandu Madhav) has his eye on Saavni and on one occasion Ganga saves Saavni from rape from Iqbal.
When the time comes for Ganga to marry, his parents inform him that his biological parents live in the city and want him to settle there. When Ganga was a kid he was diagnosed with Anaema and his biological parents Avinash (Shakti Kapoor) and Radha (Himani Shivpuri) consult a village doctor after all doctors give up hope. The village doctor advises them to put Ganga in an environment with lots of farm animals for the next 20-25 yrs to build his immunity slowly. As such, the family finds a village couple and hand over Ganga to them.. as such Ganga's father believes that the right to marry him off should reside with his birth parents.
Eventually Avinash and Radha write a letter to claim Ganga back when he turns 26 yrs old.Ganga bids tearful farewell to his village and its inhabitants (His mother had to tell him that she only reared him in exchange for money. This breaks Ganga's heart, but without this shock, he would never have left) and travels to the city of his birth parents (Ganga insists to bring Sannata along as he has nobody other than Ganga in his life). He finds that he has an elder brother Milind (Milind Gunaji), who is married to Supriya (Supriya Karnik), and younger siblings Monty, as well as his birth parents, Avinash (Shakti Kapoor) and Radha (Himani Shivpuri), who are all very wealthy. Ganga struggles to cope up with the modern city lifestyle. His sister-in-law dislikes him more as days pass by. Supriya decides to leave the house when she is embarrassed in front of her friends by Ganga.Ganga confronts Monty for smoking in the house. To take revenge Monty brings Ganga to college thinking that will embarrass him. but Ganga is a simpleton and wins the hearts of everyone at the college, including Tina. Avinash throws a party to introduce Ganga to his friends, but his lack of city manners don't go down well with anyone and Avinash has no option but to send Ganga back home. But Ganga regales the party with a song.
Tina brings Ganga to her college band and helps them win a music competition. Tina takes Ganga to her house, there he finds Milind spending time with another woman. Ganga confronts Milind at home, but he swears he is not cheating on Supriya, so Ganga backtracks.Soon word spreads about Ganga being the latest eligible bachelor. He is asked to marry a socialite, Tina (Rinke Khanna), as per his parents' wishes (even though Ganga says that he loves Saavni). Ganga agrees to everything his new-found family wants him to do as they say that they have already given their word to the bride's parents. At the engagement Saavni comes, but she tells Ganga that she is now engaged to Iqbal and is getting married next month. But Sannata knows the truth.
Things get so bad for Ganga (when Supriya hits Ganga in front of her friends for defending Radha) that he runs away from his biological parents' home and finds Milind being blackmailed by a woman (his mistress) and her brother who are asking for rs 50 Lakhs for not revealing his infidelity. He saves his brother, but his best friend Sannata gets stabbed in the stomach by one of the goons who flees the scene. Ganga gets accused for stabbing his own friend & is jailed, and Supriya forbids the house from helping him in anyway. Milind also keeps his mouth shut, but later tells the truth to Supriya.Ganga refuses to speak the truth about the incident at court as he does not want his family's reputation to be ruined. Supriya, who learns the truth from her husband, speaks out at court and proves his innocence. With a heavy heart Avinash and Radha let Ganga return to his village to his family.
After the verdict, Ganga and his best friend return to their village where he reunites with Saavni. His parents agree to get them married. Before leaving town Ganga met Tina and told her that he is going back to the village. TO keep his word, Tina breaks off the engagement with Ganga."

Those familiar with the Sinbad films of the late 20th century, featuring the Dynamation effects of Ray Harryhausen, will be dazzled by this newcomer. This first animated feature film by India-based Pentafour Software is also the first-ever full-length film to pioneer the complete use of 3-D motion capture technology. Motion capture uses infrared cameras to track the movements of live actors, which it then converts digitally into animated characters. The effect is a cartoon with a human look. Facial expressions are lifelike; gestures are fluid. Computer-generated scenes are rich in color, depth, and realism. The technology was used, in part, in the movie Titanic, yet its full potential is realized here in this fantasy-adventure tale based on the Arabian Nights character. On a beach near her palace, the beautiful and spirited Princess Serena discovers the shipwrecked Wizard Baraka. Unaware of his evil intentions, she leads him to the castle to meet her father, King Chandra. Under the guise of goodness, the wizard gives the king a potion that immediately allows Baraka to switch identities with the king. Possessing the king's appearance, Baraka throws Chandra into the dungeon with Serena as the only witness to the wicked masquerade. She escapes with one clue to save her father: she must search the ends of the earth for the Veil of Mists, where she can find an antidote to reverse the wizard's spell. Her accomplice is the legendary sailor, Sinbad, whose mercenary motive at the story's beginning (""I don't do damsels in distress,"" he says) eventually gives way to blossoming love. In the meantime, families will relish the shipwrecks, sword-fighting, and sea creatures."

Kannukkul Nilavu,2000,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0274604/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Gautham, a man with special needs, comes to Pondicherry. Hema, a carefree woman, befriends him and with the help of her father, who is a psychologist, unravels his horrific past life. The film is about a young man who suffers from a neurological condition that results in partial retrograde amnesia and delusions due to a head injury and his subsequent recovery thanks to a kind woman and her psychiatrist father.The film opens with Gautham Prabhakar searching all around Pondicherry in vain for a girl named Gayathri. He encounters a group of friends headed by Hema and requests their help in locating Gayathri, who appears to be Gautham's lover. The group members are initially hostile to him but eventually decide to help him after Gautham pursues them aggressively and Hema realizes that he may be suffering from a neurological condition resulting in amnesia and delusions. Hema's father Dr Rajashekar is a psychiatrist who discovers Gautham's real condition and the dangers it poses.It is revealed that Gautham was actually a musicologist. About six months earlier, he had travelled to a hill resort in Tamil Nadu for his research on musical patterns in the sounds of nature. While on that trip, he encountered three men - Prakash, Soundar, and Shanmugam - who all hailed from Pondicherry. Gayathri was a local girl who was teased frequently by the three men. Gayathri regularly ran up to Gautham to seek refuge from the men's pursuits. Then, one day, the three men got drunk and began molesting Gayathri. Hearing her screams, Gautham and his friend Balaji attempted to rescue Gayathri. In the ensuing fight, Balaji's knee was struck with an axe, Gayathri dropped unconscious, and Gautham was hit hard on the head with the blunt end of the axe. The way Gautham remembers it is - the three men had molested and murdered Gayathri and then had left Gautham for dead after striking him on the head. Gautham, in his hypnotic state, swears furiously to Rajashekar that he will avenge Gayathri's murder by capturing and killing the three men responsible. As it is revealed later in the film, Gayathri had not died but had merely passed out.Rajasekhar explains to Hema and her friends the reason why Gautham kept viewing Gayathri as his lover in his delusional state, even though she actually had no relationship with Gautham and he was merely trying to be a Good Samaritan. He also explains that if Gautham was treated and his memories brought back, then it could potentially create a new Gautham, a violent and aggressive one, who goes on a killing spree. Unable to decide on the next step forward, on Hema's suggestion, they decide to delay any action until Gautham's mother arrived from Malaysia. It is revealed through intermittent scenes that the mother, having not had contact with her son in all of the previous six months, is already out of her home, searching desperately for her son in India.Until the mother arrived, the kind Hema takes care of Gautham. Gautham, for unknown reasons, becomes fond of Hema and believes deeply that Hema is the only person who can help him, and in return, Hema also begins to develop feelings of affection and love towards him. Hema even wonders if it would be possible to bring Gautham back to normal by showing him enough care and affection that he forgets about Gayathri altogether. This strategy fails, as once the mother arrives, Gautham's past memories come flooding back to him and he turns into a reckless revenge-seeker, terrorizing both his mother and Hema and swearing to kill the three men who had supposedly murdered Gayathri.The remainder of the film is about how Hema and Gautham's mother put up with the new villainous Gautham, while Rajashekar devises and implements an ingenious plan to cure him. Rajashekar manages to contact the three men, who reveal the truth - Gayathri was still alive. The three men are innocent, and the only terrible mistake they had done was drunkenly striking Gautham on the head, resulting in this whole mess. While Gautham manages to capture Prakash and Soundar for his revenge, Rajashekar and Shanmugam manage to trick him successfully into entering Gayathri's current home by giving him a chase. Gautham is initially dumbstruck at seeing Gayathri still alive, but then reality eventually sinks into him, and he is cured completely. He apologizes to his mother, Shanmugam, and Hema for his torturous acts, reveals the location where he held the other two men captive, and profusely thanks Rajashekar and Hema for their efforts. Hema looks on sadly as she wonders if this is the last she would see of him. Rajashekar senses this and gives non-verbal consent for Gautham to take his daughter with him. Hema is overjoyed and the two, along with Gautham's mother, drive back."

With all four refusing to marry anyone, looks like Raja and Kanhaiya have a lot on their hands, apart from hiding from notorious criminal Pappu Anna, who has sworn to kill them for making him suffer a huge financial loss.—rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com) Wealthy Dyaneshwarprasad Pitamber (Kader Khan) has a problem, to be precise four problems - his four uncontrollable daughters, named after four Goddesses: Lakshmi (Rajshree Solanki), Saraswati (Sonu Sagar), Parvati (Rushika Reikhi), and Durga (Twinkle Khanna), who refuse to be disciplined, and be married. They have chased away the prospective grooms in every single case.
Pitamber arranges for Raju Patel (Ali Asgar) (Raju is the son of Pitamber's friend settled in America) to come from the U.S. and marry at least one of his daughters. Mama (Ashok Saraf) is Raja and Kanhaiya's mentor. Raja and Kanhaiya run scams at the airport by posing as narcotics agents and looting unsuspecting passengers. One day they stop a passenger who turns about to be a real smuggler. They hand over the guy to the police, but they don't know that the smuggler belongs to the Pappu Anna gang. Pappu Anna is angry at Raja for causing him a financial loss.Raju is waylaid at the airport by two con men, Raja (Govinda) and Kanhaiya (Johnny Lever), and his luggage, clothes, and id. is taken over by them, and he is left in barely basic clothing at the airport, mistaken for a beggar.
Raja assumes the identity of Raju, and Kanhaiya accompanies him to Pitamber's house. Once there, they are welcomed with open arms by Pitamber. The guys somehow survive all the tricks sent their way by the 4 sisters (they send wrestlers to beat them up, ask them to sing at a party and fight them in boxing 4:1). Raju reaches Pitambar's house, but is intercepted by Raja and handed off to the police as a thief.Raja gets a sense of Pitambar's wealth and tries to steal his locker, but is not successful. Durga takes Raja to a dance club with the intention of getting him beaten up by jealous boyfriend of girls that she pinches and harasses. Instead Raja sits aside and guys try to molest Durga. Raja has to intervene to prevent Durga from being forced upon sexually.
Raja brings his mama to Pitambar's house as his elder relative. While Durga is now docile, but her 3 sisters are still arrogant and anti-wedding.
Raja agrees to all conditions set up by Pitamber and his daughters in order to get married and inherent part of the vast wealth and fortune. Pitamber asks Raja to locate three other grooms for his three daughters also, otherwise, no marriage will take place, as he wants all four daughters to be married at the same time (this was an astrologers prediction and hence Pitambar is willing to offer Rs 5 Crore as dowry to each groom)Now the problem is Lakshi wants a hubby whose parents are dead, who cooks, takes her to movies daily, doesn't want kids for 5 yrs and doesn't object to her career. Parvati loves a guy who loves another girl and hence wont marry. Saraswati hates all guys. Raja asks Kanhaiya to go after Saraswati.
So Raja figures that Parvati loves a guy named Ravi who is lusting after bar dancer (Rakhi Sawant). Raja flirts with the bar dancer and she agrees to sleep with him. This shows Ravi that he made a mistake by leaving Parvati and reconciles with her.
Meanwhile Saraswati tells Kanhaiya that in college a bully harassed her and she asked for help from principal, her dad and the police, but nobody helped her and everyone asked her to avoid the bully as today it is harassment and tomorrow it will be forced sex. Raja tracks down the bully and traps him in front of the police. The bully apologizes to Saraswati and she agrees to be with Kanhaiya.
Finally Raja finds Raju on the streets of Mumbai and bring him home as the groom for Lakshmi who agrees to all her conditions. Pitambar is so overwhelmed that he hands over his entire business and life over to Raja, for solving all his problems.Pappu Anna tracks Raja down and demands Rs 5 Crores for his loss at the airport.

Raja decides that he cannot betray Pitambar's trust and wants to walk away. Mama also salutes Raja. Raja goes to the marriage ceremony and admits the entire truth to Pitambar. But Pitambar already knew that Raja was not the Raju he was waiting for. Pitambar knew Raja could solve his problem and hence went ahead with the charade. In fact when Pitambar saw that Raja had managed to convert Durga, he put the condition that all 4 girls had to be married together as he knew Raja could solve for this.

In a second task, Sakura had to use her own magic to transform the cards in Sakura Cards or they would cease being magical, whilst challenged by Clow Reeds reincarnation Eriol Hiiragizawa. Sakura successfully transforms all the cards and becomes their true mistress. The series, which the film is a continuation of, ended with Sakuras rival-turned-friend Syaoran Li confessing his love to her before leaving for Hong Kong. Sakura remained unsure of how to respond, but her affection for Syaoran led to the creation of a brand new Clow Card, appearing as a winged heart but lacked a name.The film opens in the demolished remains of the house owned by Clow Reed/Eriol, but the site begins to tremor. A chair is launched up into the air and crashes back down, revealing a hole beneath where a glowing, unsealed Clow Card lies in darkness. The film cuts to night at Penguin Park in Tomoeda, Japan, where Sakura is practicing her magic against monsters created through the power of the Create Card, and is aided by Keroberos and Yue. The fight ends, and is revealed to be part of a video recording directed by Sakuras best friend and cousin Tomoyo Daidoji. Sakura, Tomoyo and Kero (the smaller form of Keroberos) watch the video in Sakuras bedroom. While Tomoyo and Kero celebrate the film, Sakura is embarrassed by it. Tomoyo skims through the Clow Cards, trying to decide which ones to use in the next video, with Kero objecting to the use of the Change Card, reminding him of its body swapping magic which caused trouble for him and Syaoran.The mention of Syaoran causes Sakura to blush, realising she did love Syaoran when she created the unnamed Clow Card. Syaorans voice catches her attention, revealing there is unrecorded footage still on the video of Sakura and Syaoran battling the Bubble Card. Sakura admits to Tomoyo that she does love Syaoran, and intends on telling him face-to-face like he did, gaining Tomoyos support. The next day, Sakura prepares to go to school, even though it is the summer, mainly because her class is performing a play as part of Tomoedas annual Nadeshiko Festival. After being teased by her big brother Toya, Sakura rollerskates to school, but ends up late for the rehearsal, where she is to play the role of a princess opposite Takashi Yamazaki who is playing the prince. The play was written by Naoko Yanagisawa. After school, Sakura and Tomoyo pass by where Eriols house was, now replaced with an amusement park, which will open soon. That night, Sakura rehearses a part of the play at home, but the words remind her of what she will have to say to Syaoran. At the amusement park, the unsealed card materialises above the parks clock tower, taking on the form of a young girl sporting wings. This is the Nothing Card.Sakura and Tomoyo visit the park, but Sakura senses the Clow Cards aura and runs into the park to find. She rounds a corner and collides with someone, who grabs her hand. Sakura apologises but is shocked when her saviour is noneother than Syaoran. Syaorans cousin Meiling runs around the corner, surprising Sakura even more. At Penguin Park, Sakura catches up Meiling who nearly lets slip that she and Tomoyo planned this reunion. Meiling whispers to Sakura that her engagement to Syaoran has ended, following a promise they made that they would end it if Syaoran found someone else who he loved more, namely Sakura. Syaoran asks Tomoyo if she was the one who invited them to Tomoeda, which Tomoyo admits to. She asks him if he wanted to see Sakura again, but he worries that his presence will now force an answer from Sakura. Meiling explains she is staying at Tomoyos mansion during their stay and has to decline Sakuras invitation to dinner since she is going to be busy with Tomoyo, but asks Sakura to treat Syaoran instead, much to Sakura and Syaorans surprise.After Tomoyo and Meiling deliberately make excuses to leave, Sakura takes Syaoran home though the atmosphere between them is awkward, until Sakura attempts to pluck up the courage to confess to Syaoran, only for her attempt to be crashed by Keros sudden appearance when he smells cake. Sakura dashes off to make dinner, leaving Syaoran and Kero to argue to the point that Kero transforms into Keroberos and pins Syaoran to the sofa, mocking him. After dinner, Syaoran and Kero nearly argue again, but Sakura scolds Kero. Sakura takes a second opportunity to confess to Syaoran, only for Toya and his best friend Yukito Tsukishiro, the human form of Yue, enter, with Toya raging upon seeing Syaoran. Syaoran leaves for the night, with Sakura seeing him off, promising to see each other at school tomorrow. Inside, Toya and Yukito have dinner, but Toya is moody because Syaoran returned. Upstairs in Sakuras bedroom, the Clow Cards glow, and the Change Card is stolen by the Nothing Card, unnoticed by Sakura and Kero.Syaoran and Meiling arrive at school where they reunite with their friends. Meiling goes to Tomoyo, expressing her disappointment that Sakura did not confess, but Tomoyo is pleased, hoping to be able to record Sakuras confession on her trusty video camera. Sakura arrives late again, and shyly says good morning to Syaoran. After school, Sakura and her friends walk through the park, with Meiling none-too-subtly to Sakura that she should pick the right time to confess to Syaoran, though Sakura remains dense to Meilings implications. The group go to buy some juice, but Sakura becomes puzzled by its location, previously using a now-absent mailbox to remember the right street. The group leave, failing to noticing the remains of the mailbox, as if it has been erased from existence.That night, Sakura writes a letter to Eriol, who left Tomoeda four months ago back to England with his friends Kaho Mizuki, Spinel Sun and Ruby Moon. Kero also wrote a letter for Spinel, his rival, after completing a video game that day. Sakura falls asleep, as another Clow Card is stolen by the Nothing. A montage follows in school as the class rehearses for the play, with Sakura and Syaoran spending most of the time staring at each other from afar. Sakura catches Syaoran out in the hall and tries to confess, only for it to be stopped when an army of students run by. Tomoyo presents the plays costumes to Sakura and Yamizaki, Sakura wearing a beautiful pink gown, and ends up sharing a far off look with Syaoran.That afternoon, Sakura and Syaoran are deliberately left alone together by Tomoyo and Meiling, only for Sakuras fourth attempt at a confession is interrupted by Toya dressed in a rabbit costume, promoting the festival. Yukito scolds Toya and forces him to buy ice cream for Sakura and the others. Sakura and Yukito sit together, with Yukito, who was Sakuras former crush, asking if she has confessed to her true love. Sakura admits she hasnt but will do her best, Yue giving her his support and that of Yue. Another Clow Card is stolen from Sakuras bag, but this time, Sakura senses the cards disappearance and checks her bag. In the park, Sakura tell Syaoran she felt an aura but assumes it was just her imagination. The group discovers a bridge in the park has disappeared. Sakura informs Kero of the missing bridge, but while waving it off, he tells Sakura to keep her cards on hand. Sakura receives a phone call from Meiling, inviting her to the amusement park tomorrow.The next day, Sakura is late for the meet up at the amusement park, with Tomoyo and Meiling vowing to get Sakura to confess at the park. In a montage, the group are shown enjoying the day, until Meiling decides to go onto the ferris wheel. Since it is only two people per carriage, Meiling and Tomoyo decide to share one, forcing Sakura and Syaoran to go together. On the ferris wheel, Tomoyo films the carriage that Sakura and Syaoran are in, who sit in their own in uncomfortable silence. Sakura takes the opportunity to tell Syaoran without interference, only for another Clow Card to be stolen. Sakura and Syaoran both spot it and pursue the card as soon as they can exit the ferris wheel.Sensing the aura Sakura felt on the day Syaoran returned, they follow it to the parks funhouse and realise there is a new Clow Card in the attraction. Sakura and Syaoran spot the Nothing Card watching them through a mirror and confront her. Sakura goes to use the Through Card and discovers it has gone missing. Before Sakuras eyes, the Nothing steals three more cards, asking that she return her friends. Sakura summons the Wood Card, but the Nothing steals the card as well before disappearing. Sakura informs Kero of what happened, but is interrupted by a phone call from Eriol, who is aware of what is happening.Eriol explains that the Nothing was created and sealed away by Clow Reed, and acts as a negative counterbalance to the combined powers of the fifty-two original Clow Cards. Now that all of the cards became Sakura Cards, the Nothings seal has been broken and she is stealing the cards to reclaim the balance between the cards creative powers and her own destructive powers. Eriol asks if part of the city have disappeared, causing Sakura to remember the missing mailbox and bridge. Eriol explains the Nothing will continue erasing things, even people, until she regains all of the cards. Eriol tells Sakura that she must seal and transform the Nothing into a Sakura Card, but it will come at a price, namely the love Sakura has for the person she holds most dear. Eriols phone line, which has been protected by an incantation all this time, is destroyed by the Nothing, ending Sakura and Eriols call. Eriol turns to his friends including Kaho Mizuki, who asks if he knows the outcome of the situation, but Eriol does not.The next day, the class finish a full rehearsal of the play, with their teacher Mr. Terada rallying everyone for the festival tomorrow. Sakura and Syaoran go outside where it is raining and Sakura explains everything Eriol told her to Syaoran. Sakura recalls that she was briefly trapped in a world without love when she faced the Final Judgement after capturing the Clow Cards, and admits she never wants to see something like that happen again. With no apparent way around it, Syaoran seemingly admits defeat. Sakura asks why he would throw away his love so easily, but Syaoran claims he would rather give up his feelings than see the whole city be destroyed. Hurt by these comments, Sakura runs out into the rain until she meets Yukito. When Sakura is unable to explain what is wrong, Yukito transform into Yue to make it easier for her and learns of the situation and gives Sakura a boost of confidence.The day of the Nadeshiko Festival arrives, but Sakura is upset by her situation. Tomoyo, Meiling and Kero are present, with Syaoran standing outside the door. The Nothing appears, stealing another card and leaving a large hole in the middle of the schools running track. Sakura uses the Sleep Card to knock everyone save herself and her friends out, but the Nothing steals Sleep before vanishing. The others wake up, but Yamazaki has hurt his arm, leaving him unfit to participate in the play. Mr. Terada suggests cancelling the play, but Yamazaki objects, telling everyone that Syaoran is a worthy replacement. That night, Tomoyo performs onstage at an amphitheatre before the townsfolk of Tomoeda, while both Sakura and Syaoran are worrying about both performing and the Nothing Card. Tomoyo ends her song and joins Sakura and Kero in a dressing room, telling her friends that every day should be lived well so that there are no regrets.At the amphitheatre, Sakuras father Fujitaka ends up sitting beside Tomoyos mother Sonomi, who he and his late wife Nadeshiko are related too. As the play begins, Sonomi has her bodyguards prepare large video equipment to record it. Sakura enters on stage with her friends including Meiling, Sakura playing a princess at a masquerade ball. The plays setting involves two nations battling for a magic stone, but the ball is to uphold peace. Sakura comments she is not a good dancer, but Meiling encourages her to take centre stage and look for a good dancer who will help her. Sakura admits she hates war, prompting Syaoran as a prince to step up and reveal his similar opinions. Syaoran invites Sakura to dance, though admitting he is not very good at it. The two dance onstage, with Kero, Tomoyo, Meiling and an angry Toya watching.The play continues, where Syaoran and Sakura are now alone, with Syaoran admitting he is a prince from the warring neighbouring country. Syaoran then confesses his love to Sakura, who is unable to accept her own love for the prince. Most of the onlookers are in tears at this point. Sakura tells Syaoran to erase his feelings of her from his heart and goes to leave in tears, only for the lighting to suddenly explode and the whole city shakes. Realising the Nothing is near, Sakura witnesses most of the Clow Cards being stolen by the Nothing all at once. Huge black orbs spread across the city, erasing great chunks of it, and the audience, Sakuras friends, Fujitaka, Sonomi and Toya are all caught in the Nothings power and disappear. Kero and Yukito transform into Keroberos and Yue, joining Sakura, Syaoran, Tomoyo and Meiling. Sakura decides she must seal the Nothing, and Syaoran agrees to go with her.Tomoyo chimes in, revealing she has made battle costumes for Sakura and Syaoran for the upcoming battle, believing Sakura will return from the fight with a smile. On a rooftop, the group observe the destruction caused by the Nothing. Sakura and Syaoran wear their new battle costumes, Sakura wearing a pink outfit with long gloves, and Syaoran wears a similar green-coloured outfit. The Nothing steals more cards, but Sakura tries using the Windy Card to divert the cards back to her, only for them all to be caught by the Nothing. The whole building shakes, and Sakura spots Tomoyo and Meiling being caught in one of the black orbs. Sakura races to save them, but Syaoran grabs her at the last moment, but their friends disappear. Keroberos and Yue realise the Nothing is hiding out at the amusement park, so the four fly to find her.The group land at the park and are immediately set upon by enchanted parts of the park. The Nothing tosses a Viking ship at Sakura, but she evades it by using the Jump Card, which allows her to jump great heights and distances. She leaps up to the rollercoaster but sees the Nothing moving a rollercoaster cart slowly down a hill before she steals the Jump. Sakura flees from the rollercoaster and uses the Time Card to freeze time. The Nothing begins to weaken Times power and steals it. Sakura falls from the rollercoaster but is saved by Keroberos. Yue leaps into battle and tries to shoot the Nothing with an arrow, only for it to be deflected by the Nothings shield, and Yue is consumed by her power. Keroberos follows, launching a blast of fire at her, and tries to strike her from the air, only to be consumed by the Nothings power too.Syaoran concludes the Nothing can erase the magic made by Clow Reed. Sakura panics, asking what they should do, but turns and finds Syaoran has vanished. Syaoran chases the Nothing who has fled to the ferris wheel. Syaoran leaps onto it to confront her and fires a lightning-based attack at her from his sword, hoping it will convince her to become a card. Sakura runs over, as the Nothing activates its power, obliterating the ferris wheel and taking Syaoran with it. Sakura uses the Fly Card, sprouting wings, and flies to try to save Syaoran, but fails. Realising everyone she loves is gone, Sakura cries and pursues the Nothing as she flies back to the clock tower.Sakura flies up to confront the Nothing, but she steals the Fly Card, causing Sakura to fall down the tower. She grabs onto the clock towers giant pendulum and uses the Shield Card to defend herself when the Nothing breaks the pendulum in two. The pendulum drops to the ground, but Sakura makes it to a staircase spiralling the tower. Syaoran is revealed to have survived the Nothings power and crouches at the bottom of the tower. The Nothing confronts Sakura, glad that she has collected all of her friends. Sakura threatens to seal the Nothing, but she objects, trying to swallow with her powers. Trapped on a ledge, Sakura is approached by the Nothing who asks her why she is trying to take her friends from her, lamenting that she was imprisoned in darkness for so long. Sakura shouts at the Nothing, telling her stealing the cards is no way to make friends. The Clow Cards all escape the Nothing, who asks if they hate her. When the cards return to Sakuras side, she collapses and bursts into tears.The Clow Cards form a bridge for Sakura to walk to the Nothing. Sakura walks over to the Nothing, telling her that everything will be alright, and invites her to join her fellow cards out of friendship. The Nothing silently accepts, so Sakura uses her Clow Staff to seal the Nothing, lamenting she was unable to tell Syaoran how she felt. However, as the Nothing turns into a card, her powers suddenly surround Syaoran instead of Sakura. Syaoran realises he was chosen instead of her because he had more magic left, but promises Sakura even if his feelings for her are erased, he will fall in love with her all over again. Syaoran is consumed by the Nothings power, causing Sakura to cry. However, the nameless card she has flies out and intercepts the Nothings magic.Sakura sobs to herself that Syaorans love is gone, only for the nameless card to float down to her, revealed to her fused with the Nothing, and has gained a name The Hope Card. Sakura notices Syaoran looking at her, so she takes the opportunity to confess to him at long last. Syaoran does not react, causing Sakura to start crying again. However, Syaoran suddenly speaks, revealing he too shares her feelings, and his memory of her was not erased after all, thanks to the nameless card intervening with the Nothings powers. Sakura cries tears of joy as the sun rises over Tomoeda and the Nothings destruction is reversed. Outside, Tomoyo, Meiling, Fujitaka, Sonomi, Toya, Kero and Yukito awaken and find the world is back to normal, though Yukito catches Kero moving about.In the clock tower, Sakura activates the Jump Card, intending to jump through the hole in the tower to reach Syaoran. Syaoran objects, telling her to wait until the floor reappears. Impatient and ready to hug him, Sakura takes a running jump and springs across the hole to reach Syaoran, proclaiming that she loves him, as the credits roll. A promotional still that came with the DVD revealed that Sakura reached Syaoran, and landed in his arms."

At only twenty, Griffith is struggling with the responsibilities of caring for his unwell aunt, grieving the loss of their family's matriarch, and his own dreams of leaving Pine Apple. With the arrival of a stranger, Griffith's carefully constructed walls of shame and silence begin to come down and his life takes an unexpected turn.—Anonymous The film centers on Griffith (Dan Montgomery, Jr.) who has lived all his life in the fictional town of Pine Apple, Mississippi. He spends most of his time barefoot on the red dirt and has a hobby of tracing the epitaphs on headstones. He was orphaned as a child when his parents drowned inside their car in the river under mysterious circumstances. He was raised by his eccentric Aunt Summer (Karen Black) and his Uncle Charlie.Summer is mentally unstable and agoraphobic, apparently a result of the death of Griffith's parents. She and her only other living sister, Lynn Thomas (Peg O'Keef), have avoided each other for years for unknown reasons. Charlie (who died of cancer when Griffith was 14) once regularly sent Summer off to a mental asylum, being unable to deal with her eccentric behavior. She resumed living in the house after Charlie's death, cared for by Griffith and the family matriarch, Lily Mae.Griffith's only other close relationship is with Lynn's daughter, his first cousin Emily (Aleksa Palladino), with whom he also has occasional sexual relationships.The film is set shortly after the death of Lily Mae, when Griffith becomes solely responsible for caring for his aunt. Griffith resents this, feeling trapped in his environment and longing to leave. Emily does not want him to leave. She accuses Griffith of wanting to abandon her and his responsibilities to Aunt Summer. Emily herself has no wish to leave Pine Apple, even though her own mother practically pushes her to.Griffith is nevertheless determined to leave. He starts cleaning up the cottage previously used by Lily Mae with the intention of renting it out. A day after he hangs the 'For Rent' sign, a stranger from Louisiana arrives and inquires about the cottage. He introduces himself as Lee Todd (Walton Goggins). Griffith agrees to let Lee stay in the cottage for free in return for helping him finish painting it, despite the objections of both Summer and Emily.The two quickly become friends. They paint a barn roof with Emily's name and phone number and they start building a giant replica of a pincushion in memory of Lily Mae. Griffith is intrigued by Lee's experiences during his travels. Lee, in turn, urges Griffith to leave Pine Apple and see the world. He offers to take Griffith with him. Griffith agrees and they make a blood oath.Emily senses the growing closeness between the two. Feeling left out, she starts spending time with Summer. The two develop an unlikely friendship. Summer sees herself in Emily, senses her doubts and her repressed desire to leave. She also urges Emily to leave Pine Apple, but Emily dismisses this. Emily also voices her suspicions to Summer that Griffith and Lee were becoming more than friends. Summer admits to having the same suspicions but does not want to interfere, believing that she had already stood in Griffith's way enough.Emily confronts Lee and tries to convince him to leave Griffith alone. Lee refuses, telling her that he believes it's best for Griffith to leave Pine Apple.Summer thrives in the company of Emily, who convinces her to finally get out of the house and try to get over her agoraphobia. Driving out on country roads, they chance upon Lee and Griffith, who have just finished building the replica of Lily Mae's pincushion in the middle of a field. The sight of it finally triggers closure on Summer's part, setting her on the path to recovery.While bathing in the river that afternoon, Lee tells Griffith that they should be leaving soon for Texas. Griffith agrees but asks for one more week to prepare. That night, Griffith asks permission from Summer to leave. Summer encourages him. She asks him not to worry about her but she also betrays guilt over Griffith's childhood, something Griffith can still not understand.Emily catches Lee putting away stuff for storage and learns that Lee and Griffith are leaving together. She confronts Griffith and confesses that she loves him, the reason she didn't want to leave. Griffith tells her it isn't enough anymore and that he has to leave.Summer asks Emily to drive her to her sister. During their conversation the reasons for their alienation became clear. The death of Griffith's parents was not an accident. Summer had been having an affair with her late sister's husband and Griffith is actually Summer's son. Although Summer gave him up to her sister (who couldn't conceive), it didn't prevent the eventual breakdown of her sister's marriage. They gave Griffith back to Summer and committed suicide by driving off a bridge. Lynn blames Summer for their sister's death. Summer is wracked by guilt over it but is still thankful that she got to take care of Griffith after all.Meanwhile, Emily confronts Griffith for the final time, openly accusing him of being gay. Griffith becomes angry and unthinkingly tries to rape her in an attempt to prove his heterosexuality. He stops himself in time and runs away into the rain. Griffith finds Lee and accuses him of lying to him about his intentions. Lee tells him what has been obvious, that deep inside Griffith knew that it was already something more than friendship. Griffith denies it vehemently and punches Lee when he tries to kiss him. Griffith goes home and shuts himself in his room.The following day, Lee visits Emily to say goodbye. He finds Emily packing her things. She has decided to leave Pine Apple for New Orleans. They finally admit to each other that they both love Griffith. Before Lee leaves, Emily assures him that Griffith does love him.After Lee has left town, Summer finally admits to Griffith that she is his real mother. Griffith is initially incredulous but eventually believes her. In doing so, he finally realizes he doesn't need to run away after all, that he actually belongs to Pine Apple. He sets fire to the giant pincushion, which was to him a symbol of his desire to leave. He also makes up with Emily before she leaves for New Orleans, after bidding a tearful goodbye to Summer.Lee unexpectedly returns shortly after. Griffith receives him warmly but they carefully avoid the subject of their previous fight. As Lee is turning away to leave for the final time, Griffith finally gets the courage to admit that he loves him back and kisses him. Lee drives him back to Summer's house.Griffith opts to remain in Pine Apple with Summer. He and Lee read a poem inscribed on Lily Mae's headstone to each other and part with the implication of keeping in touch.Forever and a day and the blood of man, stained red the dirt of the Mississippi land. And in this journey we go, but in this place well stay. If only in the heart, where memory of love, eternally remains."

The Nine Lives of Tomas Katz,2000,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0235618/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A man comes to London, uses a strange force to take over different men's identities, and creates chaos. The last day of creation. A stranger arrives in London. No one knows who he is or where he has come from. By the time he leaves, the entire universe will have been erased. A black comedy about the Apocalypse, 'The Nine Lives...' presents a unique brand of left-field humor, spiritual beauty, and spectral horror.—Anonymous The Nine Lives Of Tomas Katz Review
84 minutes, UK/Germany (2000), The second feature from British writer-director Ben Hopkins, this is a low-budget, apocalyptic black comedy. Erratically executed, it still exudes eccentric inventiveness
On the day of a solar eclipse, stranger Tomas Katz (the hugely versatile Fisher) materializes from a man-hole at the edge of the M25. Inexplicable powers enable this bizarrely-dressed individual to take on the identities of people he comes into contact with, and in these different guises - taxi-driver, government minister, London Underground controller, security guard - he wreaks havoc on a fast-disappearing metropolis.Suddenly the Tube trains are carrying the souls of the dead to the Valley of Judgement, whilst the country has declared war on an obscure Pacific island. Only the mystical and blind Chief of the Metropolitan Police (McNeice) can foil Katz and prevent the end of the world by finding the legendary astral child.The highly improvised The Nine Lives of Tomas Katz draws on a whole range of references and influences, including Monty Python, German expressionism, 'The Day Today', MTV pop videos, and Derek Jarman. Handsomely shot in black and white, there's evidence here of a fertile cinematic imagination on the part of Hopkins (whose previous feature, Simon Magus, was similarly shot through with the uncanny), enabling the spectator to view (and hear) London from a fresh perspective.However, there's also a significant downside to the freewheeling style in the form of erratic pacing, ramshackle structure and woolly ideas, which result in the film becoming irritating, at times little more than a series of surreal set-pieces. The fact that the credits include a dedication to ""the bollards and windows of London"", gives some indication of the off-the-wall nature of the whole enterprise."
