Cleopatra,1963,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0056937/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Queen Cleopatra VII of Egypt experiences both triumph and tragedy as she attempts to resist the imperial ambitions of Rome. In 48 B.C., Julius Caesar (Sir Rex Harrison) pursues Pompey from Pharsalia to Egypt. Pharaoh Ptolemy XIII (Richard O'Sullivan), now supreme ruler after deposing his older sister, Cleopatra VII (Dame Elizabeth Taylor), attempts to gain favor with Caesar by presenting the conquerer with the head of Pompey, borne by his governors, Pothinus (Grégoire Aslan) and Achillas (John Doucette). To win Caesar's support from her brother, Cleopatra hides herself in a rug, which Apollodorus (Cesare Danova), her servant, presents to Caesar. The Roman is immediately infatuated. Banishing Ptolemy, he declares Cleopatra Egypt's sole ruler and takes her as his mistress. A son, Caesarion (Loris Loddi), is born of their union. Caesar, however, must return to Italy. Although he is briefly reunited with Cleopatra during a magnificent reception for the Queen in Rome, Caesar is assassinated shortly thereafter, and Cleopatra returns to Egypt. When Mark Antony (Richard Burton), Caesar's protégé, beholds Cleopatra aboard her elaborate barge at Tarsus some years later, he is smitten and becomes both her lover and military ally. Their liaison notwithstanding, Antony, to consolidate his position in Rome, marries Octavia (Jean Marsh), sister of the ambitious Octavian (Roddy McDowall). The marriage satisfies no one. Cleopatra is infuriated, and Antony, tiring of his Roman wife, returns to Egypt. There he flaunts his liaison by marrying Cleopatra in a public ceremony. Sensing Antony's weakness, Octavian attacks and defeats his forces at Actium. Alarmed, Cleopatra withdraws her fleet and seeks refuge in her tomb.—alfiehitchie In 48 B.C., the young Queen of Egypt, Cleopatra VII (Dame Elizabeth Taylor), seduces Julius Caesar (Sir Rex Harrison), who has just defeated Pompey the Great and uses her charms to manipulate him and to establish her authority. Little by little, things will work out as planned, and now that the ambitious Cleopatra's son, Caesarion (Loris Loddi), is born, she can almost taste Egypt's long-awaited union with Rome, and the formation of a mighty empire. However, after Caesar's unforeseen death, the beautiful Queen will besiege his powerful Roman General, Mark Antony (Richard Burton), leading him to a personal and political demise, as Octavian (Roddy McDowall) takes over and wages war on the two lovers.—Nick Riganas The story of Queen Cleopatra VII of Egypt (Dame Elizabeth Taylor) who wants to stabilize her power by using the tensions in the Roman Empire. Julius Caesar (Sir Rex Harrison) visits Egypt, has an affair with her, and returns to Rome. She bears his child and visits Rome to claim her place at Caesar's side. He is murdered before this can happen. She returns to Egypt leaving Rome in turmoil. Mark Antony (Richard Burton) follows her to Egypt and they fall in love. However, Octavian (Roddy McDowall) defeats Antony in battle.—Simon Hedges Epic saga of the legendary Queen's reign from the time Julius Caesar (Sir Rex Harrison) arrived in Egypt until her death around eighteen years later. Cleopatra (Dame Elizabeth Taylor) is portrayed as a schemer, firstly to gain control over the Egyptian kingdom from her brother with whom she ruled jointly. Having gained the confidence of Caesar, they become lovers and she bears him the son he never had. Her attempts at ensuring that the boy takes his rightful place in Rome are thwarted when Caesar is assassinated and she flees back to Egypt. Many years later, Marc Antony (Richard Burton), now responsible for the eastern half of the Roman Empire, seeks an alliance with Egypt. He and Cleopatra become lovers and form a military alliance, but are forced to retreat after losing a major naval encounter at Actium. Both eventually take their own lives.—garykmcd The movie opens in 48 B.C. shortly after the Battle of Pharsalus where Julius Caesar (Rex Harrison) has defeated Pompey's army in a brutal civil war for control of the Roman Republic. Caesar learns that Pompey has fled to neutral Egypt, hoping to enlist the support of the young teenage Pharaoh Ptolemy XIII (Richard O'Sullivan) and his sister Cleopatra (Elizabeth Taylor).A few months later, Caesar arrives in Alexandria, the then-capital of Egypt. He meets the teenage Ptolemy whom is frequently surrounded by an entourage of ministers and advisers, who seem to do most of the thinking and decision-making for him. As a gesture of 'goodwill', the Egyptians present Caesar with Pompey's severed head, but Caesar is not pleased; it is a sorry end for a worthy foe.As Caesar settles in at the palace, Apollodorus (Cesare Danova), disguised as a rug peddler, brings a gift from Cleopatra. When a suspicious Caesar unrolls the rug, he finds Cleopatra herself concealed within. He is intrigued with the young queen's beauty and warm personality as she persuades him to help her take back her thrown from her younger brother.Days later, Cleopatra warns Caesar that her brother has surrounded the palace with his soldiers and that he is vastly outnumbered. Caesar is unconcerned. He orders the Egyptian fleet burned so he can gain control of the harbor. The fire spreads to the city, burning many buildings, including the famous Library of Alexandria. Cleopatra angrily confronts Caesar, but he refuses to pull troops away from the fight with Ptolemy's forces to deal with the fire. In the middle of their spat, Caesar begins kissing her.The Romans hold the main gate to the city after a fierce nigh-time battle. The next day, the armies of Mithridates arrive on Egyptian soil and drive off the armies of Ptolemy. The following day, Caesar passes judgment in a show trial. He sentences Ptolemy's lord chamberlain to death for arranging an assassination attempt on Cleopatra, and rules that Ptolemy and his tutor be banished to the desert to join Ptolemy's now greatly outnumbered troops, a sentence of death as the Egyptian army faces off against the Mithridates.Cleopatra is crowned Queen of Egypt. Afterwords, she tells him about her dreams of ruling the world with Caesar. A year later, a pregnant Cleopatra gives birth to their son Caesarion. Caesar accepts him publicly, which becomes the talk of Rome and the Senate.Caesar returns to Rome for his triumph, while Cleopatra remains in Egypt. Two years pass before the two see each other again. After he is made dictator for life, Caesar sends for Cleopatra. She arrives in Rome in a lavish procession and wins the adulation of the Roman people. The Roman Senate grows increasingly discontented amid rumors that Caesar wishes to be made king, which is anathema to the Romans.On the Ides of March in 44 B.C., the Senate is preparing to vote on whether to award Caesar additional powers for the Republic. Despite warnings from his wife Calpurnia (Gwen Watford) and Cleopatra, he is confident of victory. However, he is stabbed to death by various senators.Octavian (Roddy McDowall), Caesar's nephew, is named as his heir, not Caesarion. Realizing she has no future in Rome, Cleopatra returns home to Egypt.Two years later in 42 B.C., Caesar's assassins, among them Cassius (John Hoyt) and Brutus (Kenneth Haigh), are killed at the Battle of Philippi. The following year, Marc Antony (Richard Burton) establishes a Second Triumvirate government with Octavian and Lepidus. They split up the republic: Lepidus receives Africa, Octavian takes control of Spain and Gaul, while Antony will take control of the eastern provinces including Asia Minor and Syria. However, the rivalry between Octavian and Antony is becoming apparent.In 38 B.C., while planning a campaign against Parthia in the east, Antony realizes he needs money and supplies, and cannot get enough from anywhere but Egypt. After refusing several times to leave Egypt, Cleopatra gives in and meets Antony for the first time in the port city of Tarsus, Asia Minor. Antony becomes drunk during a lavish feast aboard Cleopatra's large golden ship. Cleopatra sneaks away, leaving a slave dressed as her, but Antony discovers the trick and confronts the queen in her bed chamber. They soon become lovers.Octavian uses their affair in his smear campaign against Antony. When Antony returns to Rome to address the situation brewing there, Octavian traps him into a marriage of state to Octavian's sister, Octavia (Jean Marsh). Cleopatra flies into a rage when she learns the news.A year or so later, when Antony next sees Cleopatra, he is forced to humble himself publicly. She demands a third of the Roman empire in return for her aid. Antony acquiesces and divorces Octavia. Octavian clamors for war against Antony and his ""Egyptian whore"". The Senate is unmoved by his demands until Octavian reveals that Antony has left a will stating that he is to be buried in Egypt; shocked and insulted, the Senators who had previously stood by Antony abandon their hero and vote for war. Octavian murders the Egyptian ambassador, Cleopatra's tutor Sosigenes (Hume Cronyn), on the Senate steps.The war is decided at the naval Battle of Actium on September 2, 31 B.C. where Octavian's battle fleet, led by General Agrippa (Andrew Keir) lures the overconfident Antony's ships away from land and defeats them in piecemeal. Seeing Antony's ship burning, Cleopatra assumes he is dead and orders the Egyptian forces home. Antony follows, leaving his fleet leaderless and soon defeated.Several months later, Cleopatra manages to convince Antony to retake command of his troops and fight Octavian and Agrippa's advancing army. However, Antony's soldiers have lost faith in him and abandon him during the night. Rufio (Martin Landau), the last man loyal to Antony, is killed. Antony tries to goad Octavian into single combat, but is finally forced to flee to Alexandria.When Antony returns to the palace, Apollodorus, not believing that Antony is worthy of his queen, convinces him that she is dead, whereupon Antony falls on his own sword. Apollodorus then takes Antony to Cleopatra, and he dies in her arms. Octavian captures the city without a battle and Cleopatra is brought before him. He wants to return to Rome in triumph, with her as his prisoner. However, realizing that her son is also dead, she arranges to be bitten by a poisonous asp. In the final shot, Octavian and Agrippa enter Cleopatra's temple afterwords to see her dead, dressed in a gold funeral robe with her two handmaidens, also bitten by the same venomous snake that Cleopatra allowed herself to get bitten, dying by her side. Octavian also finds a last letter from Cleopatra requesting to be buried with Marc Antony.In the voice-over epilogue, the narrator claims that Octavian accepted Cleopatra's last request and allowed her to be buried with full honors next to Marc Antony inside her palace in Alexandria. Octavian returned to Rome several months later in to a hero's welcome for ending the last Roman civil war, and two years later, Octavian adopted the name Augustus and proclaimed himself emperor of the newly formed Roman Empire, and Egypt became a conquered Roman province."
It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World,1963,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0057193/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A group of motorists witnesses a car crash in the California desert, and after the driver's dying words indicate the location of a hidden stash of loot, they turn against each in a race across the state to get to it. The story begins when three cars and a moving van stop to help crashed reckless driver ""Smiler"" Grogan, who, before kicking the bucket, cryptically tells the assembled drivers that he's buried a fortune in stolen loot ""under a big W!"" All of the motorists set out to find the fortune.—Jwelch5742 After a long prison sentence ""Smiler"" Grogan is heading at high speed to a California park where he hid $350,000 from a factory robbery job 15 years previously. He accidentally careens over a cliff in view of three cars and a moving van whose occupants go down to help. The dying Grogan gives details of where the money is buried, and, when the witnesses fail to agree on sharing the cash, a crazy chase develops across the state.—Col Needham <col@imdb.com> Blockbuster comedy. Brilliantly simple, the plot concerns a caravan of motorists who witness a terrible accident on a dangerously winding California desert highway. The auto-crash victim, Smiler Grogan, reveals in his dying words that he has hidden a fortune of stolen cash, sending the drivers on a rambunctious race to see who can claim the loot first!—filmfactsman Somewhere in the California desert a car speeds like crazy along a winding road. Suddenly, the driver loses control and sails off a cliff. Four other vehicles he passes stop to help. The dying man narrates the drivers of a fortune in cash, $350,000, which he has hidden below a giant ""W"" in Santa Rosita, some 200 miles away. The four drivers and their respective passengers can't decide on how to share the future fortune, and suddenly a wild race to Santa Rosita develops. While one party manages to rent a plane (from 1916), the others face different problems like tire damage, untrustworthy lifts, deep water, a drunken millionaire, a cactus-loving British military man, a little girl's bicycle, and last but far not least a mother-in-law from hell and her short-tempered imbecile son. While the folks struggle towards the goal, they are being watched. Whoever said that nobody else knew about the fortune?—Julian Reischl <julianreischl@mac.com> The film begins with an accident on a lonely freeway in the Southern California desert: Ex-con Smiler Grogan (Jimmy Durante) loses control of his car and drives it off a cliff. A group of motorists -- dentist Melville Crump (Sid Caesar), best friends and comediens Dingy Bell (Mickey Rooney) and Benjy Benjamin (Buddy Hackett), entrepreneur J. Russell Finch (Milton Berle), and trucker Lennie Pike (Jonathan Winters) -- stop to assist Grogan, but he is fatally injured. In his last words, he mentions a cache of loot he hid under a big W at a park in Santa Rosita. The police arrive, but to get out of being held for questioning, all the motorists inform them Grogan was raving and didn't mention anything significant.The motorists continue their separate ways: Crump is on honeymoon with his wife Monica (Edie Adams), Dingy and Benjy are on holiday to Vegas, Pike has furniture to transport to Yuma, and Finch, his young wife Emmeline (Dorothy Provine), and his mean, overbearing mother-in-law Mrs. Marcus (Ethel Merman) were on vacation at Lake Mead, but eventually they all decide to stop and discuss Grogan's words. They try to reason with each other for a fair share, but inevitably matters deteriorate as it becomes clear that all of them are too greedy to divide the money equally, with each party demanding a bigger cut should they find the buried cash. It leads to Benjy deciding to plan a full-out race to get to the money, and everyone gets back into their vehicles and drives off.Dingy and Benjy race against the Crumps to get a plane to fly to Santa Rosita. The Crumps win and charter a pilot, who owns a rickety World War I biplane in which they make the journey, but when they go to a hardware store to get shovels to dig out the money, the place closes down and they end up trapped inside.Dingy and Benjy drive to another airport and hire Tyler Fitzgerald (Jim Backus), a millionaire who loves to drink and fly, to take them to Santa Rosita, but en route Tyler gets drunk and passes out, forcing the two to fly the plane on their own.Pike crashes his truck into the Finches, putting both vehicles out of comission. They force him to go get them another automobile by having him ride a bicycle from inside his truck. The Finches later get a ride with Colonel Hawthorne (Terry Thomas), a British officer on holiday, and leave Pike behind.Mrs. Marcus hits on a brilliant idea: Her devoted son, Sylvester (Dick Shawn), is a lifeguard in Santa Rosita, so she tries to contact him, but he's busy dancing with a bikini-clad girl. Besides, Russell doesn't trust Sylvester not to take the money and steal away, and gets into an argument with Mrs. Marcus, resulting in Hawthorne and Russell abandoning Emmeline and her mother, and going ahead on their own. Mrs. Marcus eventually manages to call Sylvester, but he mishears her and thinks Russell got her into trouble, so he leaves Santa Rosita to go save her.Pike meanwhile gets a ride with sneaky, smooth-talking motorist Otto Meyer (Phil Silvers). A desperate Pike makes the foolish mistake of telling Meyer the whole situation to get his cooperation and a lift, and is abandoned on the road, as the greedy Meyer decides to go for the money for himself. An enraged Pike chases Meyer to a gas station where Meyer stopped to get a tire fixed, but Meyer convinces the gas attendants, Irwin and Ray, to tie him up. This doesn't stop Pike: He wrecks the station and makes off with the attendants' tow truck. He reluctantly picks up Mrs. Marcus and Emmeline, and later Sylvester, Russell, and Hawthorne, who've been quarreling.Meanwhile, Meyer stops to give a ride to a miner stranded on the side of the road and is forced to help the miner drive down a rocky mountainside to his cabin so the miner can deliver medicine to his sick wife. But after dropping the miner off, Meyer finds himself stuck in a ravine, unable to drive his car up the steep hills. The miner's son decides to show Meyer an ""easy way back"" to the main road. The trail leads Meyer and the miner's son down another steep hillside and to a river. Attempting to cross the river, Meyer's car sinks, but he manages to swim ashore. After walking back to the main road, Meyer manages to catch a ride with a nervous man (Don Knotts) who Meyer manages to con out of his car and carry on to Santa Rosita alone.Observing the whole manic marathon is Captain C.G. Culpepper (Spencer Tracy), a Santa Rosita cop and precinct commander who'd been tracking Smiler Grogan for years, and suspects that Grogan might have told the motorists about his hidden cash, confirmed by their erratic behavior. Culpepper's plan is to have the motorists followed by the state police hoping they find the money, then confiscate it and turn it over to the authorities and he can retire with his career on a successful note. However, he suffers family troubles: His wife constantly nags him; his daughter is always moody and running off; and his friend the police chief (William Demerist) tells him that his modest retirement pension won't be raised because his honesty has created enmity within the force. After thinking it over, and when discovery of the money is close at hand, Culpepper decides on a rash plan to move in and take off with all of the money for himself to Mexico as soon as he confiscates it.Everybody eventually converges on Santa Rosita: The Crumps have blasted out of the hardware store using dynamite, and Dingy and Benjy manage to land the plane; each duo commandeers a taxi to the park, each of whose drivers suspects something and get into the hunt. The others also arrive, and Culpepper surreptitiously slips in to follow them. The motorists manage to discover the Big W, four palm trees growing in a W shape, and find the money buried there, as Grogan promised. As they argue over how to split it, Culpepper introduces himself as an officer of the law, confiscates the money, and recommends that they turn themselves in so that the judge will be lenient and reduce their sentences.The motorists see Culpepper drive away, realize they've been had, and go after him (Dingy wants to return the money to the authorities to get a reward, while the greedy Mrs. Marcus wants the money for herself). The authorities also learn of Culpepper's absconding and order his arrest. A frantic and climactic chase results in all 11 men at the top of a condemned building from which Melville had ordered the women out, for their own safety. In the ensuing fracas, all the money is lost, as it falls into a gathering crowd. A firetruck arrives to bring the men down safely, but when they all try to climb on the ladder it goes out of control, throwing them off into various locations.The film ends with all the men in a prison hospital, awaiting trial for the mayhem they've caused. Culpepper, now an ex-cop, expects the worst-case scenario for himself. Greedy and selfish to the end, all of the men are blaming each other for the predicament they're now in. The women are in custody for their involvement, and Mrs. Marcus enters the ward, naturally places all the blame on the men, and promptly slips on a banana peel thrown by Benjy and hurts herself, having to be carried away shrieking on a gurney. All the men have a good laugh at this, including Culpepper."

He is followed by a hulking, light blonde-haired man dressed in black, who effectively eludes him. The blonde-haired man emerges from behind a hedge, pulling a garrote wire from his watch, which he slips around Bond's neck. Bond is dead in a few moments. A rubber mask made to look like Bond's face is peeled from the dead man's face by the blonde-haired killer, revealing a nameless imposter. The assassin's supervisors emerge, documenting the mission time and revealing that the mission is a training exercise for SMERSH.At a championship chess match, Chief Planning Officer for the Special Executive for Counter-intelligence, Terrorism, Revenge and Extortion (SPECTRE), a Pole named Kronsteen, aka Number Five (Vladek Sheybal), wins the match and is called away to meet with the Chief of SPECTRE, Ernst Stavro Blofeld, aka Number One (who's face remains unseen). Also at the meeting is ex-SMERSH Colonel, now Chief Operations Officer for SPECTRE, Rosa Klebb (Lotte Lenya), aka Number Three.Blofeld holds a white Siamese cat in his lap when he meets with his underlings. He also kept three Siamese fighting fish in an aquarium. Blofeld comments that the fish naturally fight each other, but while two are fighting, there's always one that holds back until the other two stop. Then, that cunning fish attacks the weakened victor and kills it easily. Thus SPECTRE's main strategy is to instigate conflict between two powerful enemies, hoping that they will exhaust themselves and be vulnerable when SPECTRE moves to seize power.Kronsteen devises a plot to steal a Lektor cryptographic device from the Soviets and sell it back to them, while exacting revenge on Bond for killing their agent, Dr. No the previous year. The plan is to trick Agent 007, James Bond (Sean Connery) into collaborating with a Soviet agent in stealing the Lektor from the Soviet embassy in Istanbul, which they will then take from Bond, while framing him and the Russian for the deed. Klebb will be in charge of the operation. Blofeld is skeptical that the British would fall for such an obvious trap, but Kronsteen reassures him that the obviousness of the trap is precisely the reason why they will go along with it; they will see the situation as a challenge to be overcome. Blofeld gives the operation his blessing on one condition: that Bond's death be ""a particularly unpleasant and humiliating one.""To lure Bond into the trap, Klebb recruits Tatiana Romanova (Daniela Bianchi), a cipher clerk at the Soviet consulate in Istanbul. Romanova is an unwitting pawn, as she thinks Klebb is still working for SMERSH. Tatiana's cover story will be that she is a Soviet consulate clerk in Turkey who wants to defect to England.In England, Bond is in a small boat near a river, making out with his sometime girlfriend, Sylvia Trench (Eunice Gayson), when he's summoned to MI6's London headquarters to meet with ""M"", Chief of British Intelligence, (Bernard Lee). As he enters the main office, Bond tosses his hat across the room and neatly onto the hat rack.M tells Bond that Romanova has contacted their ""Station 'T'"" in Turkey, offering to defect with a Lektor, which MI6 and the CIA have been after for years; however, Romanova has stated she will only defect to Bond, whose photo she has allegedly found in a Soviet intelligence file. M and Bond immediately suspect a trap with this Lektor business, but M orders Bond to Istanbul anyway, telling him to meet with British Intelligence Station Chief in Istanbul, Ali Kerim Bey (Pedro Armendáriz).Bond's armorer, Major Boothroyd (Desmond Llewelyn), the head of Q Section, provides Bond with a briefcase containing a tear gas bomb that detonates if the case is improperly opened, a folding AR-7 sniper rifle with twenty rounds of ammunition, a throwing knife, and 50 gold sovereigns. Moneypenny provides Bond with a photo of Romanova, which Bond commits to memory and signs ""From Russia with love...""At the SMERSH training facility, Klebb arrives by helicopter and meets with Morzeny (Walter Gotell), the SPECTRE thug who trains personnel on SPECTRE Island. Morzeny takes her to a man named Donald 'Red' Grant (Robert Shaw), the same tall, blonde-haired assassin that killed the impostor Bond during the training exercise. Grant is in the process of getting a massage from a beautiful woman (Jan Williams) on the lawn outside at a small lake after an exercise workout. As Klebb walks with Morzeny and his chief aide through the training area, Klebb reads from the file that Morzeny gives her explaining that Grant is an Irish national who escaped from Dartmorth Prison in England back in 1960 where he was serving a life sentence for a murder charge and recruited by SPECTRE while he was hiding out in Tangiers the previous year in 1962. Morzeny describes Grant as being diagnosed as a ""homicidal-paranoia"" which is ""superb material"" for SPECTRE, and despite Grant's lack of social skills and crude manners, his training as an assassin by SPECTRE has been remarkable.Klebb directs Morzeny to call Grant over. Grant hurries over and Klebb looks his body up and down, then slides some brass knuckles onto her fingers and delivers a solid blow to his solar plexus. When Grant doesn't flinch from the blow, she decides he'll do, and she orders him to be sent to Istanbul by tomorrow, where he will be the second main player in her plot.A few days later, Bond arrives in Istanbul and is driven to Kerim Bey's offices. The car is followed from the airport, by both local Bulgarian operatives (who spy for the Soviets) and Red Grant. Bond's driver, Bey's son, assures Bond that there is no danger, as they and the KGB's operatives tail each other constantly in Istanbul. However, Grant ambushes and kills the Bulgar driver, leaving the body in the backseat of the car where it will be quickly discovered.Bond meets with Bey, who informs him that the Soviet embassy, though heavily protected, can be infiltrated and the Lektor can be stolen.Bond checks into his hotel, asking to be given another room when he finds a listening device behind a painting in his assigned room. He is told the bridal suite is the only other room available, so he accepts.That evening, Bey, relaxing with his mistress (Nadja Regin) at his office, is nearly killed when the retaliatory bomb goes off. Nadja had lured him away from the blast zone only moments before. The next morning, Bond goes to Bey's office, where he's briefed on the incident.Bey takes Bond to the city's underground reservoir below his offices. They climb into a rowboat and travel a short distance to the area directly beneath the Soviet embassy. Bey has installed a surplus British submarine periscope, which elevates under a table in the embassy's conference room. Bey and Bond then look to see who is meeting there.They identify Krilencu (Fred Haggerty), a Bulgarian assassin who works as a killer for the Soviets in the Balkans. Bey tells Bond that Krilencu has been gone from Istanbul for a year, so it's curious that he's returned. Bey suspects it must have been Krilencu who planted the bomb that nearly killed him. Bey desires revenge, but chooses not to, not wanting to do anything that might jeopardize Bond's mission. As Bond peers through the eyepiece, a beautiful woman walks in. Bond and Bey are unable to identify her because her face doesn't come into view.Bey takes Bond to a gypsy camp outside the city for the evening to hide out. Bond meets Vavra (Francis de Wolff), the chief of the tribe who does dangerous work for Bey now and then. After watching Leila (Lisa Guiraut), a belly dancer, perform, the chief of the camp orders two young women, Vida (Aliza Gur) and Zora (Martine Beswick), who both seek to marry his son, to be brought from their wagons. In accordance with Gypsy tradition, the two women must fight, with the winner to be the bride.Vida and Zora are in the early stages of their vicious cat-fight, when the camp is attacked by Krilencu and his Bulgarian thugs. In the ensuing gunfight and chaos, Bey is shot in the right arm and Bond is saved by Grant, who, from a hidden position observing the camp, shoots a man intending to attack Bond with a sword. Grant's purpose is to make sure Bond is able to complete his mission.After the KGB men withdraw, Vavra declares Bond to be one of his ""sons,"" in honor of Bond's bravery and assistance. Bond thanks him, then requests a favor of the chief: he asks that the fight between the women be stopped. The man laughs, suggesting that Bond is too softhearted to be a gypsy, but he agrees to let Bond make the decision.The following night, Bey resolves to kill Krilencu. He and Bond go to Krilencu's hideout, where Bey has two of his operatives working as Turkish policemen. The policemen knock on the Krilencu's door, a deliberate move to force Krilencu into fleeing his hideout. They then see Krilencu attempting to use an escape hatch built into a large billboard on the building. Krilencu drops a rope along the outside the building and starts down. He's an easy target for Bey, who uses Bond's sniper rifle, with Bond's shoulder as support, to shoot Krilencu. Krilencu falls to the ground dead.Bond returns to his hotel room and is just about to take a relaxing bath when he hears noises in the main room. He puts on a towel and sneaks out of the bathroom, moving over to where he had set his pistol. He picks up his gun and then sees a human shadow disappearing out on the patio. He follows in that direction and into the adjacent room, where there's a beautiful young woman lying in her bed. It is Tatiana. She'd lured him over there.They introduce themselves and within minutes they are making love, deciding to discuss the details of how they'll go about obtaining the Lektor machine in the morning. The two are unaware that their encounter is being filmed from behind a one-way mirror by Klebb and a cameraman.The next day, Bond arranges to meet with Tatiana at the Hagia Sophia Cathedral, intending to receive a map of the Russian Consulate from her. Tatiana leaves the map at the base of a pillar, but a KGB agent, who was trailing her, reaches it before Bond can. Grant moves in and kills the KGB agent and again quickly slips away, unseen by Bond or Tatiana. Bond reaches the dead KGB man and finds the map still clutched in his hand. He takes the map and leaves, wondering who might have killed the agent.Bond takes the map to Bey, who determines that a bomb set off in the consulate would be enough of a distraction for Bond to enter the communications room, steal the Lektor, and escape with Tatiana into the caverns below the city.Bond later meets with Tatiana on a ferry, where he uses a tape recorder made up to look like a camera, to record Tatiana's description of the Lektor. The recording is subsequently listened to by M and several other high level officials, who determine that the device Tatiana speaks of is authentic. Q's secretary, Miss Moneypenny (Lois Maxwell), was also listening to the tape, until M told her to leave, as Tatiana kept flirting with James in between her statements describing the Lektor. Miss Moneypenny is able to listen in via the office intercom. She seems both amused and jealous at what she's hearing. At one point, Bond makes reference to a mission where his and M's behavior was perhaps less than exemplary and M orders the tape stopped. M orders Bond to go ahead with the plan to acquire the Lektor.Bond reports to the Soviet embassy at precisely 3:00 p.m. under the guise of the intent to purchase a visa for travel to the USSR. A few minutes later, a bomb goes off, having been placed near the wall to the communications room. The explosion breaks a hole in the wall of the room and Bond slips in easily, grabs both the Lektor and Tatiana, and they escape into the caverns. They are led outside by Bey.Bond's escape from Istanbul involves a lengthy ride on the Orient Express to Trieste in Italy. Bey has reserved a sleeper car for both Bond and Tatiana, who are posing as a married couple. Bey tells them they he will plan to stop the train at a certain point where Bond and Tatiana are to disembark and to meet another of Bey's sons, who will give them documents and assistance in smuggling the Lektor across the Italian border.On the train, Bey identifies a Soviet security officer named Benz (Peter Bayliss), who is tailing them. Bey makes it his duty to keep a close eye on Benz during the train ride. Bey and Benz later turn up dead in Bey's compartment. The train's conductor (George Pastell), believes they killed each other and he goes to Bond, whom he knew to be an associate of Bey, to let him know. Bond follows the conductor to Bey's compartment and witnesses the scene. He pays the conductor to keep the deaths a secret for the rest of the trip. Bey and Benz were actually the victims of Grant, who was also on the train. With Bey dead, as well as his plan for stopping the train dead with him, the train is forced to go on and does not stop at the rural place where one of Bey's sons are. Bey's men hurry away to find a telephone to find out what happened.Bond briefly suspects that Tatiana had something to do with Kerim Bey's death and roughly interrogates and even hits her, but she claims ignorance to anything going on. Not trusting her anymore, Bond secludes himself and the Lektor device away from Tatiana.That evening the train arrives at the Belgrade train station in Yugoslavia. Bond briefly disembarks and meets with one of Bey's sons and, after regretfully telling the man that his father had been killed, asks him to arrange for an MI6 agent from Station Y to meet him at the next stop in Zagreb. They are both watched and overhead by Grant still in hiding on the train.A few hours later, Grant leaves the train when it stops in Zagreb and intercepts British Agent Nash, from Station Y, there to meet Bond. Grant kills Nash (off camera) and assumes Nash's place, stealing his hat, wallet, business card and briefcase. Grant then meets Bond for the first time and (speaking for the first time with a rich upper class English accent) introduces himself as ""Captain Nash"". Bond seems immediately suspicious of Grant, because he was late in coming to meet with him. After talking for a while in Bond and Tatiana's cabin, Grant invites Bond to dinner on the train and Bond accepts, but he sends Tatiana on ahead with Grant, telling them he had to tend to something first. Bond then opens the briefcase Grant had been carrying and checks the contents. Inside, he finds Nash's clothes and a pistol, but nothing out of the ordinary. Bond then heads for the dining car.Bond finds it curious that Grant orders red wine with his fish dinner, but says nothing. Toward the end of the meal, Grant drops a sleeping pill into Tatiana's drink. She becomes drowsy and falls asleep in their room. In the adjoining room, Grant deceives Bond into looking at a map. Then, while explaining how he plans to effect their escape across the border, he sneaks a pistol from an ankle holster and hits Bond over the head with it, knocking him out temporarily.When Bond comes to, Grant (now speaking with an Irish accent) reveals that he has been sent to kill both Bond and Romanov and steal the Lektor. Grant further taunts Bond, boasting that SPECTRE has been pitting the Soviets and the British against each other, and claims that Romanova thinks that ""she's doing it all for Mother Russia"". He also tells Bond he plans to frame him for Tatiana's murder and cause a scandal involving Bond's earlier tryst with her, which was filmed by Klebb. He tells Bond that after he kills both of them, he will plant the film in her handbag along with a forged blackmail letter, so it looks like it was a murder-suicide. Bond finally comes to the realization that Grant is not with SMERSH, but is working for SPECTRE. He is impressed by the genius of the plan.Bond offers to double whatever Grant is being paid by SPECTRE, but Grant isn't interested. In fact, he tells Bond that he intends to torture him before killing him. Trying to stall for time, Bond plays his final card; Bond asks for a cigarette, but Grant refuses. Bond offers to pay for it with some gold sovereigns he has in his briefcase. Grant tells Bond to show him the sovereigns. Bond removes the sovereigns from his briefcase (he'd actually transferred them from Nash's briefcase to his own). With a clear hint of greed in his voice, Grant then asks Bond if there are any more gold sovereigns in Nash's briefcase. Bond says 'yes', that it's standard issue briefcase. Bond offers to take a look, and it is here that Grant falls right into the trap. Thinking that Bond has a weapon hidden in the other briefcase (Nash's pistol) Grant decides to open the other case himself.Grant opens the other case the incorrect way (without turning the latches on the briefcase) and the tear gas canister explodes in his face and Bond attacks him. The two fight viciously, slamming each other around, into the room where Tatiana lay sleeping, and then back to the adjoining compartment. Grant attempts to strangle Bond with a garrote wire that he had hidden in his watch, but Bond is able to get to the knife hidden in his briefcase and stab Grant in the arm. Bond eventually strangles Grant with the garrote.One of Grant's cohorts parks a flower truck across the train tracks and forces the train to stop a few minutes later. Bond is barely able to revive Tatiana enough to jump off the train. He hides her behind some shrubs, then jumps back on the outside of the train as it starts up again, riding it just a few hundred feet to near the flower truck, that had been moved from the tracks by a couple of trainmen. James jumps off and the train continues on. The driver is calling out to Grant, wondering where he is. James rushes the driver and knocks him down and out. He binds the man's hands with a belt, then puts him in the cab of the truck and Tatiana in the bed of the truck, with the flowers.The next morning, Bond is driving the truck down the road when a helicopter approaches. There are two men, the pilot and one other. The passenger starts lobbing grenades down at the truck, trying to force it off the road, or at least to stop. James jumps out with his briefcase, puts Tatiana under the truck, then takes off running. He hides under a rock, assembles his rifle, and shoots the helicopter passenger just as he's preparing to toss another grenade at Bond. Bond hits the man's arm causing him to drop the grenade inside the helicopter. It explodes and crashes.At Number One's office, Klebb and Kronsteen are being admonished for the plan having failed. Kronsteen arrogantly denies any fault in his plan and claims that Klebb chose the wrong people to carry it out, while Klebb in turn says that the plan failed because Kronsteen did not treat Bond as a serious threat. Number One presses a button on a panel on his desk and Morzeny enters the room, coming up behind Klebb and Kronsteen. Number One tells them that SPECTRE does not tolerate failure, and he appears to be blaming Klebb directly. Klebb lowers her head and acknowledges, believing she's about to die. Morzeny releases a dagger hidden in the toe of his boot and prepares to kick out at Klebb, but at the last second, he twists his foot and stabs Kronsteen instead. The blade is tipped with a fast-acting venom and Kronsteen falls dead within 12 seconds. Number One remarks that they'll need to work on developing a faster acting poison. Number One then tells a frightened Klebb that she now has total control of the mission and has one last chance to get the Lektor and kill Bond in Italy.Meanwhile, Bond gets the flower truck driver to tell him that Grant was planning to escape by boat, so Bond drives there to a small dock. They get in the boat and head for Trieste. Bond asks the driver if he can swim, then unbinds his hands and pushes him overboard.A few hours into their long boat trip, Bond and Tatiana are intercepted by Morzeny and others, dispersed among three speedboats. They lob grenades and fire automatic weapons at Bond, trying to get him to stop. Some of the bad guys didn't particularly understand their objective, however, and end up hitting several large drums of fuel that were on Bond's boat. Bond releases the holds on the barrels, sending them into the water. When Morzeny sees the barrels floating by, he orders the boats to slow down. Tatiana then hands Bond a flare gun, which he uses to set all the floating fuel and the barrels on fire. Morzeny and his men, crashing into each other's boats, are either burned alive or forced to jump into the water, as the fire envelopes them.Bond and Tatiana reach Venice and are making preparations to leave for England when Klebb enters their hotel room, disguised as a maid. She holds Bond at gunpoint, ordering Romanov out of the room with the Lektor. Klebb then raises the pistol to kill Bond, but Tatiana rushes back into the room and knocks the gun out of her hand. Bond and Klebb fight. Bond has to grab a chair and pin Klebb against the wall with it, as she was attempting to kick him with the poisoned dagger in the toe of her shoe. Tatiana recovers Klebb's pistol and, after a brief and confused hesitation, shoots Klebb, killing her. When Tatiana remarks that she was a ""horrible woman"", Bond replies ""Well, she's had her kicks.""In the final scene, Bond and Tatiana take a romantic pleasure cruise on Venice's Grand Canal. Tatiana returns the wedding band that MI6 had provided for the mission and Bond puts it in his pocket for safekeeping until he can return it. He then removes from his pocket the film of his and Tatiana's night together, pulling it out partway and examining some of the frames. He kisses Tatiana passionately and throws the film in the river, waving to it as they drift away."
The Sword in the Stone,1963,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0057546/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A poor boy named Arthur learns the power of love, kindness, knowledge and bravery with the help of a wizard called Merlin in the path to become one of the most beloved kings in English history. Arthur (aka Wart) is a young boy who aspires to be a knight's squire. On a hunting trip he falls in on Merlin, a powerful but amnesiac wizard who has plans for Wart beyond mere squiredom. He starts by trying to give Wart an education (whatever that is), believing that once one has an education, one can go anywhere. Needless to say, it doesn't quite work out that way.—Tim Pickett <quetzal@yoyo.cc.monash.edu.au> The kingdom of Britain has, for years, remained divided. Wart, a measly servant knave, dreams of becoming a knight but is barely certain he may act as squire to castle lord Sir Ector son Kay; then, the sorcerer Merlin and his grumpy, talking owl Archimedes invite themselves to the studio and move into the north tower. Merlin, who can magically access the future, intends to prepare Wart for a grand future, so he gives the squirt dangerous lessons, transforming themselves into animals to learn the mental skills befitting a knight and a ruler. Since the once-renown magical sword in the stone that could confer the kingdom of all England unto one person (thus unifying it) has never been able to be withdrawn for years, a tournament in London is formed to designate a ruler instead. Kay is going to compete, but the rude, lout stands no chance.—KGF Vissers In Medieval England, after the death of the King, no one can decide who is the rightful heir to the throne. With war threatening to tear the country asunder, a stone and anvil appear from the heavens in London town, with a sword planted firmly in the anvil. On the hilt of the sword, read the words, ""Whoso pulleth out this sword of this stone and anvil is rightwise king, born of England."" Many try to pull the sword, but none can budge it. In time, the sword is forgotten, and the Dark Ages plunge the English countryside into a dismal state.Out in the woods one day, Sir Kay is out hunting with his foster brother Arthur, whom everyone names 'Wart.' After causing Kay to miss shooting a deer, Arthur promises to retrieve the arrow. Arthur's journey leads him to a small cottage, where a wizard named Merlin and his pet owl, Archimedes, reside. Merlin explains to Arthur that he was expecting him to appear. After they have tea, Merlin decides to accompany Arthur back to his home and after packing up everything in the hut into a small satchel, the two set off.Arthur and Merlin arrive at the castle of Sir Ector, where Arthur is immediately put to work in the kitchen. Merlin introduces himself and Archimedes to Ector and displays his powers to the doubting lord. After some persuasion, Ector allows Merlin to stay, putting him up in the Northwest Tower, a crumbling edifice of the castle.A few days later, Archimedes observes the arrival of Sir Pelinore, who has brought news from London of a jousting tournament to Ector and Kay. According to the rules, the winner of the tournament will become the new King of England. Ector eagerly begins to have Kay train, and in his excitement, promises Arthur that if he keeps working hard at his duties, he can become Kay's squire.Merlin hears of this news and decides to push Arthur to see his true potential (as Merlin can move into the past and the future, he knows who Arthur will become). While walking outside along the castle's moat, Merlin explains that he can turn into a fish, making Arthur excited. So Merlin turns himself and Arthur into fish to explore the moat. However, a much larger fish soon gives chase to young Arthur, who is saved Archimedes.Upon returning to human forms, Arthur's tardiness in helping Kay practice results in him washing dishes. Merlin finds him, and after bewitching the dishes and washing utensils, leads Arthur into the forest, where they both are turned into squirrels. As Arthur leaps among the trees, he comes across a girl squirrel, who is soon madly infatuated with him. Merlin finds the whole scenario cute, until he is soon found irresistible by another squirrel. Merlin then changes himself and Arthur back to normal. The girl squirrel who was infatuated with Arthur, skitters away, heartbroken.Back at the castle, a panicking maid warns Ector and Kay about the kitchen being under a spell. Kay and Ector immediately arrive at the kitchen where they prepare to do battle on the enchanted dishes, trying to undo the spell. However, they fail and get beaten by magical dishes and appliances. Arthur and Merlin return to the castle and after undoing the spell in the kitchen, Ector accuses Merlin for making Arthur leave his duties and for casting 'black magic' in the kitchen. After being threatened by a maid, Merlin disappears and when Arthur defiantly tries to defend Merlin, an angry Ector refuse to listen and punishes him by declaring that Hobbs will become Kay's squire, leaving Arthur devastated.Arthur is glum about the kitchen incident, but Merlin tries to get him to persevere and plans to educate Arthur. As he attempts to explain things, Archimedes interjects on Merlin's teaching methods, as Merlin is educating Arthur on things that will not be proven for hundreds of years and could very well lead people to think of Arthur as a raving lunatic in their current Dark Ages.Exasperated at this lecturing, Merlin turns teaching duties over to Archimedes, while he fiddles with a model plane. Archimedes scoffs at the toy plane, while Merlin attempts to prove that 'man will fly.' His efforts lead to the plane plummeting like a rock to the moat below. Even though the plane's flight was a failure, Arthur tells of how he's often dreamed of soaring like a bird. It is then that Merlin uses his magic to fulfill this wish. Archimedes then takes it upon himself to teach Arthur to fly, but is soon impressed by how quickly he has picked up the technique. Their lessons are then interrupted when a hawk appears, chasing Arthur into the nearby woods.Arthur soon finds himself in the thatched hut of a witch named Madam Mim, who playfully shows Arthur her magic powers, which are moreso for evil purposes. As Arthur explains more about Merlin and his magic, Mim decides to 'destroy' the little bird. However, before she can do this, Merlin appears and Mim proposes a Wizard's Duel.Merlin accepts and the two head off into the woods, where they then shapeshift into a number of creatures, all in an attempt to destroy the other. It appears that Mim has won, until Merlin turns himself into a germ, causing the witch to become gravely ill. With Mim now safely 'detained,' Merlin, Arthur, and Archimedes head back to the castle.In the castle, during Christmas, as Kay and Ector prepare to head off to London for the tournament, they are informed by their panicking maid that Kay's squire, Hobbs, has come down with the mumps. Needing a replacement quickly, Ector recruits Arthur. Arthur then joyfully goes to tell Merlin the news. Archimedes commends the boy, but Merlin is cross that after all he's done to try and teach Arthur, he has chosen such a demeaning thing as being a squire to Kay. Arthur tries to reason with Merlin, but an angry wizard grows so cross that he rockets out of the room, yelling 'Blow me to Bermuda!' Archimedes explains that he's gone to an undiscovered island somewhere, but doesn't know if the wizard will return.In London, the tournament is under way, and Kay is soon up for battle. However, Arthur realizes that he left Kay's sword back at the inn they are staying at. Kay furiously yells for Arthur to retrieve it immediately. When Arthur gets there, he is saddened to find the inn locked. As Archimedes looks around, he sees the sword in the stone. With little effort, Arthur draws the sword from it's resting place, and rushes back to the tournament.Kay is at first angered that the sword isn't his, until Ector notices the inscription and Sir Bart announced every knights, nobles and peasants that someone has pulled the Sword from the Stone. When Ector asks Arthur how he got it, he refuses to believe the boy could have pulled the sword out himself.Arthur, Ector, Kay, Pellinore, Sir Bart, and the rest of the crowd return to the stone and anvil, where Ector re-inserts the sword, wanting Arthur to do it again. Kay brushes the boy aside, feeling that since it's already been pulled, anyone can do it. However, the sword has again become immovable. This causes a stampede of the crowd trying to pull it out, but Sir Pellinore and Sir Bart decided that Arthur should pull the sword. Arthur tries again and succeeds where the others have failed. Ector kneels and begs for forgiveness from Arthur for who he treated the boy. At Ector's request, Kay bows down as well.As the legend decrees, Arthur is made King of England. However, he is unsure just what to do and cries out for Merlin's help. Merlin then returns back from Bermuda and the 20th Century. When Arthur explains what happened, Merlin grows happy that it seems that Arthur has fulfilled his destiny and now plans to help the 'once and future king.'"
Charade,1963,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0056923/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Romance and suspense ensue in Paris as a woman is pursued by several men who want a fortune her murdered husband had stolen. Whom can she trust? In what's been called 'the best Alfred Hitchcock film which he didn't direct,' a man is thrown off a train, and when the police locate his wife, it turns out she knew nothing about him - not even his real name. After her are four men, who insist she's in possession of a huge amount of money which they believe to be theirs. If she doesn't give it to them, she'll be killed.—Huggo After her estranged husband's murder, jet-setter Regina is pursued by three crooks who want the money her husband stole from them. With her life in jeopardy, she turns to charming stranger Peter for help, but soon discovers he isn't who he claims to be, and that his own agenda is far from clear.—Prime Video Dragged into a white-knuckle, cat-and-mouse game to unearth $250,000 allegedly stolen by her estranged and recently deceased husband Charles, Regina Lampert, an elegant American interpreter living in France, crosses paths with dashing perfect stranger Peter Joshua. And as if the terrible sense of loss weren't enough, a trio of ruthless cut-throats picks up the sweet scent of easy profit, bent on finding the lost cash first. As suave but enigmatic Peter dices with death to protect Regina before the situation spins out of control, little by little, a timid relationship forms; however, money corrupts. Now, fragile alliances and dangerous encounters spell trouble, and Regina can only count on herself to unravel the secret. But what are the chances of getting to the bottom of the mystery when trust falters?—Nick Riganas After Regina Lampert (Hepburn) falls for the dashing Peter Joshua (Grant) on a skiing holiday in the French Alps, she discovers upon her return to Paris that her husband has been murdered. Soon, she and Peter are giving chase to three of her late husband's World War II cronies, Tex (Coburn), Scobie (Kennedy) and Gideon (Glass), who are after a quarter of a million dollars the quartet stole while behind enemy lines. But why does Peter keep changing his name? The Paris-Bordeaux express speeds through the French countryside--and suddenly a dead man, clad only in pajamas and a bathrobe, tumbles off the train and down an embankment.The scene shifts to Mégève, the premier ski resort in the French Alps, where Regina Lampert (Audrey Hepburn) is sitting at a table on a platform overlooking the mountain. Before her is food sufficient for three adults, not just one. She is totally oblivious as an automatic pistol, held by a gloved hand, takes direct aim at her. The hand pulls the trigger--and out shoots a harmless water jet that sprays all over her face. Taking off her glasses, Regina looks at young Jean-Louis Gaudet (Thomas Chelimsky), age 8, who suddenly looks very guilty. ""Don't tell me,"" says Reggie, ""you didn't know it was loaded.""She calls out for her friend, Sylvie Gaudet (Dominique Minot), who sends the boy to find some other place to play while she helps Reggie to dry off. Noting the table full of food, Sylvie asks Reggie what's wrong. The answer: Reggie has decided to divorce her husband, Charles. The two stroll through the resort as Reggie says that she is frustrated with Charles' incessant secrecy and lies. Sylvie, a ""modern woman"" to the core, suggests that Reggie simply have affairs on her husband's money, but Reggie doesn't think that way.Just then a dapper gentleman (Cary Grant) approaches, with Jean-Louis in tow, saying that Jean-Louis was throwing snowballs at Baron Rothschild. As Sylvie takes Jean-Louis back to apologize to the Rothschilds, the mystery man, giving his name out as Peter Joshua, strikes up a conversation with Reggie. Reggie flirts with him almost outrageously, and ""Peter Joshua"" plays along. The two agree to reconnect when they each return to Paris.Reggie arrives home--only to discover that her apartment is totally empty, and even the maid is gone--along with every stitch of clothing, every piece of furniture, and even the rugs. After she opens cabinet after cabinet, finding them all empty, she starts to rush out--and runs pell-mell into Inspector Edouard Grandpierre (Jacques Marin) of the Police Judiciare. Grandpierre asks her to come with him to the Prefecture--and specifically to the Paris Morgue. There Reggie identifies a dead man (in fact it's the man who fell off the Paris-Bordeaux train in his PJs) as her husband.Grandpierre continues the interview in his office. He tells her that the authorities found Charles' body near the railroad tracks, and that he had a steamship ticket to Venezuela on him when he died. The authorities also know that, two days ago, Charles had sold everything in the apartment at public auction. Value: 1,250,000 NF, or $250,000 US. The problem: the authorities in Bordeaux did not find the money. Grandpierre gives back to Reggie all the items that Charles had on him: one wallet containing 4,000 francs, one pocket appointment book listing his last appointment (for the day before, 5:00 p.m., Jardin des Champs-Ëlysées), one steamship ticket, one letter (stamped but not sealed, addressed to Reggie; contents unremarkable), one key to the apartment, one pocket comb, one toothbrush, one tin of tooth powder--and, more incredibly still, four passports, one each Swiss, American, Italian, and Chilean, each under a different name. Of these, Reggie recognizes only the Swiss passport.Reggie goes home, for what it's worth, and stands in the dark, smoking a cigarette, when ""Peter Joshua"" arrives. He says only that he read about Charles Lampert's death in the newspapers and came to be of help. Eventually ""Peter"" offers to take Reggie to a modest hotel near enough to her job at the European Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization, where she and Sylvie work as translators.Charles' funeral occurs the next day. Reggie, Sylvie, and Inspector Grandpierre are the only three in attendance. Then three other men come in, one at a time: Leopold W. Gideon (Ned Glass), who sneezes at Charles; Tex Panthollow (James Coburn), who uses a pocket mirror to make sure that Charles is not breathing; and Herman Scobie (George Kennedy), a hard-bitten man wearing a hook for a right hand, who sticks a pin into Charles to make sure that he will not jump from the pain. Though the other two found seats at the viewing, Scobie stalks out. As Reggie sits and wonders what will happen next, the funeral director touches her shoulder and hands her a note from a ""Hamilton Bartholomew,"" at the United States Embassy, asking her to come in to see him on Monday afternoon.Reggie goes to the Embassy, and there meets Bartholomew (Walter Matthau). He introduces himself as the Paris station chief of the CIA, and says that her husband, known to the CIA as Charles Voss, is wanted for the theft of the $250,000. He also reveals that Gideon, Tex, and Scobie were Charles Lampert/Voss' squad mates in a military unit that Bartholomew does not describe further. He warns her: find that money and turn it over to the American authorities, or her life will remain in danger.Reggie walks to ""The Garden"" (Jardin des Champs-Élysées) and takes in a Punch and Judy show, where ""Peter Joshua"" catches up to her. Not sure how much she can reveal, she confesses that she is frightened. ""Peter"" offers to take ""charge of cheering [her] up,"" and makes a date with her. They go to a nightclub--where Gideon, and then Tex, each threaten Reggie with death if she does not turn over the money to him. Reggie asks ""Peter"" to take her back to their hotel, and while ""Peter"" wants to know what happened at the club, Reggie wants to flirt, and is scared to give any more details. Frustrated, ""Peter"" leaves Reggie to go into her room--and then Reggie, once inside, finds Scobie inside. He has turned the room upside down and now attacks her with his claw ""hand."" She rushes out, finds ""Peter,"" and breathlessly says that ""a man"" tried to kill her. ""Peter"" rushes in, and Reggie hears fight noises, and then silence. She bursts in, and finds that ""Peter"" is a little the worse for wear, and Scobie fled out the window. ""Peter"" tells Reggie to lock herself in, while he goes out the window and gives chase--by jumping from balcony to balcony.In fact, ""Peter"" knows exactly where to go: to Gideon's room on that same floor. He finds Gideon, Tex, and Scobie inside. Tex and Gideon are bawling Scobie out for accosting Reggie by himself. ""Peter"" steps in through the window and joins in the ""bawling out,"" and tells the ""Three Marx Brothers"" to stop ""breathing down [his] neck"" and let him gain Reggie's trust and find out whether she has the money or not. Scobie stalks out again, and ""Peter"" prevails on Tex to let him have his room, which is the room next to Reggie's.""Peter"" goes back down the hall and tells Reggie that he found ""no trace"" of Scobie. Now he insists that Reggie tell him what's happening. She tells him all she knows, which isn't much. ""Peter"" pledges that he will simply not allow any of those three to kill her. In the middle of this conversation, Reggie gets a call--from Scobie, who asks her whether ""Dyle"" is in the room with her. In other words, ""Peter Joshua"" is actually a man named ""Dyle,"" a name she does not recognize. Reggie hangs up, and tells ""Peter"" that the call was simply another threat, and ""Peter"" says that he has ""arranged"" to take the room next to hers.""Peter"" leaves the room, but then, using a thread unraveled from his sock, prepares a trap to let him know whether she's leaving the room. Unaware, Reggie calls Bartholomew and shocks him with the revelation that ""someone else,"" named ""Dyle,"" is also after the money. Bartholomew instructs Reggie to meet him at once at Les Halles, opposite the St. Eustace church. Reggie leaves, figures out that ""Peter"" (now known as ""Dyle"") is behind her, and shakes him loose by paying a taxi to drive off to any old place, and waiting for ""Dyle"" to get into the next cab and say, ""Follow that cab!""At Les Halles, Bartholomew reveals the full story as the CIA knows it: in 1944, five members of the Office of Strategic Services were ordered to go behind German lines and deliver $250,000 in gold to the French Résistance. The five were, of course, Charles, Tex, Gideon, Scobie--and one Carson Dyle. Instead of delivering the gold, they buried it, intending to report that the Germans had captured it. But on their way back to base, a German war patrol ambushed them. Scobie lost his right hand in the attack, and Carson Dyle took several rounds in the stomach. Scobie could still travel, but Dyle was presumably dead, so the four left him behind and returned to base. Charles then double-crossed the other three by stealing all the gold for himself and vanishing.Bartholomew wants to know who the man calling himself ""Dyle"" could possible be, because Carson Dyle is dead. Reluctantly, Reggie agrees. The next morning, she follows ""Dyle"" to the American Express office--where, sure enough, he goes to the ""A to D"" counter to check for mail, and finds nothing. Reggie then goes into a phone booth, calls the operator, and has ""Dyle"" paged. ""Dyle"" answers, and Reggie lets him know that she has him red-handed.""Dyle"" tells a new story: Carson Dyle is his dead brother, and he suspects Gideon, Tex, Scobie, and Charles of having murdered Carson Dyle because he objected to their plan to steal the gold. He also assurs Reggie that he is on her side, not theirs. But in the middle of their conversation, ""Dyle"" drops the telephone and leaves his booth.The reason: Scobie has taken him hostage at gunpoint. Scobie and ""Dyle"" ride to the top floor, where Scobie holds Dyle until the AmEx staff close for the day, then orders ""Dyle"" to the roof. There Scobie demands that ""Dyle"" hand over the money. ""Dyle"" says that he does not have it, and wouldn't surrender it if he did. Scobie orders ""Dyle"" to step off the roof, but gets too close, so ""Dyle"" knocks the gun out of his hand. The two struggle with might and main--and then Scobie falls onto the steeply inclined mansard and ends up hanging by his prosthetic hook from the gutter. ""Dyle"" cheerfully advises him to write ""Love Thy Neighbor"" on the wall 100 times.""Dyle"" goes back to Reggie and tells her that he ""ran into someone with sharp fingernails."" Reggie treats his badly-scratched back, and from him learns his ""new"" last name: Alexander. The two start flirting again, and then Reggie gets another horrifying call from Tex, saying that the three men have Jean-Louis as a hostage.Reggie and ""Dyle"" both show up in Tex's new room. There ""Dyle"" tells the men that of course the boy doesn't have the money, and neither does Reggie. He then offers a new theory: that one of the three found Charles first, cornered him on the train, killed him, and then, without telling the other two, took the money and returned to Paris to blend in until they gave up. He proposes that the three can search his room and Reggies, and he and Reggie will search their rooms. The three men grudgingly agree. Gideon and Tex find Charles' effects in Reggie's room, and don't find anything worth $250,000--whereupon Tex wonders aloud whether ""Dyle"" was right. Reggie and Jean-Louis search Scobie's room and succeed only in finding Scobie's spare prosthetic. Then ""Dyle"" leads them all back to his own room--where they find Scobie, drowned in the bathtub. Gideon and Tex agree to take Scobie back to his own room and dry him off.After the hotel maid (Claudine Berg) makes the inevitable horrifying discovery, Inspector Grandpierre summons Reggie, ""Dyle,"" Gideon, and Tex to his office. He tells them quite severely not to leave Paris until he has found out how these two men died.Reggie and ""Dyle"" spend one-third of their time trying to figure out which of the two remaining cutthroats killed Scobie and Charles, and the rest of the time flirting, first near L'Île de la Cité and then back in her room (where ""Dyle"" famously takes a shower with his clothes on). While this is going on, Bartholomew calls Reggie to tell her that Carson Dyle had no brother. Reggie still agrees to go out to dinner with ""Dyle,"" but at a place with a lot of people: one of the floating restaurants of the Seine.There Reggie tells her mystery man that Carson Dyle had no brother. Whereupon the mystery man, giving the name Adam Canfield, says that he is, quite simply, a thief, and was simply trying to con the three cutthroats out of money they themselves stole. ""Adam"" also tells Reggie, speaking very clearly about such things for the first time, that he is very attracted to her.That night, Gideon takes a call at 3:30 a.m. to come down to the lobby. He gets on the elevator, which then stops between floors, the lights going out. Then the elevator starts again--and goes all the way to the basement. Gideon keeps sneezing--and then lets out a blood-curdling scream that causes the concierge (Bernard Musson) to wake up and call the elevator back to street level--only to find the dead Gideon inside, his throat cut.An angry Grandpierre notes that three men have died, all in their pajamas, and that Tex has disappeared. Grandpierre questions Reggie and ""Adam"" about their whereabouts, and accepts their alibis (for why would they invent the story that each was in his or her room, asleep, and alone?). Satisfied that Tex took the money and ran, ""Adam"" tells Reggie to go back to bed. But then ""Adam"" gets a call from Tex, who now is threatening to stalk ""Adam,"" still known to Tex as ""Dyle,"" for the money!""Adam"" asks Reggie to go over Charles' effects with him one more time; they conclude that their search is at a dead end. But the next morning, ""Adam"" breathlessly goes to see Reggie at the EURESCO offices. He has found the torn-up remnants of the list that Grandpierre prepared of the effects, pasted it back together, and realized that Tex has made off with the appointment book. Reggie recalls the last appointment: Thursday at 5:00 p.m. The two abruptly leave EURESCO and rush to The Garden to look around. They don't know what to look for, but neither does Tex, who also is skulking around.The two then split up. ""Adam"" follows Tex, who wanders into the stamp market, and suddenly realizes the significance! He brushes past Adam, who then also realizes that stamps are the key! The two then race each other back to the hotel. There ""Adam"" catches up with Tex and demands that Tex hand over the stamped-but-unsealed letter. Tex hands ""Adam"" the envelope--but the stamps are torn off, and Tex doesn't have them either.Reggie, meanwhile, has caught up with Sylvie, who tells him that she has brought Jean-Louis to the stamp market, where Jean-Louis hoped to trade the three strange-looking stamps that Reggie gave him. Reggie now realizes that the stamps are the form into which Charles had converted the money! They barely catch up to Jean-Louis, who identifies Monsieur Félix (Paul Bonifas) as the man to whom he sold the stamps. Félix receives them gladly and agrees to sell the stamps back for an amount of money more in line with the collection of tourist-grade stamps he gave Jean-Louis in exchange. The reason: Félix knew that someone had made a mistake, and was just as glad of the honor of owning three of the most valuable stamps in the world, even for five minutes.Reggie rushes back to tell ""Adam,"" but then finds a terrible sight: Tex, bound hand and foot to the two radiators in his room, with a plastic bag over his head, and obviously dead. But worse: he has written the word DYLE on the carpet. To Reggie, DYLE means ""Alexander,"" therefore ""Adam."" Upset, she calls Bartholomew to tell him about finding Tex, and about the stamps. Bartholomew tells her to meet him at once at the center garden at the Palais Royal, near the colonnade.But as Reggie leaves, ""Adam"" is on his way back. So now ""Adam"" gives furious chase to Reggie. She, not able to hail a taxi, tries to shake ""Adam"" in the Paris Métro. She manages to get to the district where the Palais Royal stands, and to shake ""Adam"" long enough to call the American embassy and ask for Hamilton Bartholomew. The operator informs her that Bartholomew has left for the day, so Reggie leaves a breathless message for him.The embassy operator then calls the home of Hamilton Bartholomew (Colin Drake), who is not the man whom Reggie saw in an embassy office! The real Bartholomew is totally mystified and advises the operator to call the French police. But the man who posed as Bartholomew is waiting for Reggie to come to him, with ""Adam"" in hot pursuit.Upon seeing the poseur, ""Adam"" draws his gun and shouts, ""Reggie, stop! That man is Carson Dyle!""How ""Adam"" would know who Carson Dyle is, Reggie has no time to figure out--because the man she thought was a CIA station chief admits that his name really is Carson Dyle, and that he stalked Charles, Scobie, Gideon, and Tex in revenge for having left him for dead. He threatens to kill Reggie if she does not hand over the stamps right then and there--but ""Adam"" has moved from column to column to get closer to Dyle. He takes aim--and misses, but distracts Dyle enough for Reggie to bolt for it.Reggie takes refuge in the Paris Opera House. Dyle follows her in the front door, and ""Adam"" gets in through the stage door and walks down to the lower backstage level. Reggie has taken refuge in a prompt booth, while Dyle walks through the orchestra seating section and then gets up on the stage. ""Adam"" makes a serious mistake: he tries the prompt booth door, and that only lets Dyle know where she is. Slowly he walks, with clumping footsteps, toward the prompt booth--and ""Adam"" realizes that the stage is composed of trap doors. All that ""Adam"" has to do is wait for Dyle to stop walking, identify the right trap door, and throw the switch. And that is how he kills Dyle just as he is drawing back the trigger to kill Reggie.""Adam"" and Reggie go back to the hotel, where Reggie wants ""Adam"" to prove his love to her by telling her to go to the American Embassy and turn in the stamps. ""Adam"" protests that the US government would barely miss the money, but Reggie insists. A Marine directs her to the office of ""Mr. Cruikshank,"" Treasury attaché. She goes there, and ""Adam"" excuses himself, saying that he can't stand the sight of ""all that money being given away."" Reggie goes into the office, announces herself, and then goes into the private office to meet Mr. Cruikshank face-to-face. And he turns out to be none other than the mystery man.Reggie protests strongly at such deception, but the man, whose full and true name is Brian Cruikshank, cheerfully answers all her questions, explaining especially how Carson Dyle could pass himself off as a CIA station chief. (The answer: 12:30 is the lunch hour, and Dyle took the office belonging to none other than the chief of Embassy security!) Reggie still wants more satisfactory identification, and Bryan almost casually says that if she could wait a week, he would ""put it on the marriage license."" Whereupon she breathlessly tells him that she loves him, ""whatever [his] name is,"" and promises to bear him lots of sons and name them all after him."
Bye Bye Birdie,1963,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0056891/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A rock singer travels to a small Ohio town to make his ""farewell"" television performance and kiss his biggest fan before he is drafted. Conrad Birdie is the biggest rock & roll star of the 60's ever to be drafted. Aspiring chemist and song writer Albert is convinced he can make his fortune and marry his girlfriend Rosie if he gets Conrad on the Ed Sullivan show to kiss a high school girl goodbye. Albert's mother will do anything to break him up with Rosie. Kim and Hugo, the high school steadies, live in Sweet Apple, Ohio where most of the action takes place.—Lisa Grable <grable@unity.ncsu.edu> Conrad Birdie, arguably the biggest rock and roll superstar in the world, has just been drafted, which brings his legion of teen-aged female fans marching in the streets in protest. One other person not happy about Birdie being drafted is struggling songwriter Albert F. Peterson, a mama's boy of a man who was finally going to hit the big time when one of his songs was to be featured in a Birdie movie. Rosie DeLeon, Albert's long suffering secretary and fiancée of six years, pitches an idea toEd Sullivan: have Birdie appear on his television program,The Ed Sullivan Show (1948)kissing one of his fans as a symbolic goodbye to all his fans, while he sings a yet to be written song by Albert to be called ""One Last Kiss"". Sullivan buys the idea. Rosie is hoping that this move will bring financial security to Albert, who will then be able to support his mama, ex-vaudevillian Mae Peterson who wanted Albert to go into show business instead of his want to become a bio-chemist, and marry her (of course if Mama allows the marriage, she who doesn't even know they're engaged). The fan chosen is Kim McAfee of Sweet Apple, Ohio. Up until being chosen as the recipient of Birdie's kiss, Kim's sole focus in life was being pinned by her boyfriend, Hugo Peabody. Birdie's presence in Sweet Apple brings up many issues which may thwart Rosie and Albert's plans, including a jealous Hugo, an exasperated Harry McAfee (Kim's father), and a ballooning line-up on the show, all these problems which Rosie and Albert try to manage. The ultimate problem may be outside of Rosie and Albert's control, except for a little assistance of some bio-chemistry hopefully to solve the problem. Regardless, Rosie, in the end, may only be able to take so much of Albert siding with Mama instead of her.—Huggo When the draft selects rock star Conrad Birdie (Pearson), his fans are devastated, but none more than struggling songwriter Albert Peterson (van Dyke), whose song Birdie was just about to record. Albert's longtime girlfriend, Rosie (Leigh), pushes Albert to write a new tune that Birdie will perform on television to a fan selected in a contest. The scheme works, with young Ohio teenager Kim McAfee (Ann-Margaret) declared the winner, but no one has counted on the jealous wrath of her boyfriend. None-too-successful songwriter Alberto Paterson hatches a plot with his secretary - and long-suffering girlfriend - to get rock-and-roll phenomenon Conrad Birdie to sing one of his songs on the Ed Sullivan show. The pop star would then symbolically sing goodbye to a young man chosen at random from the country's manhood, this being his last appearance before being drafted. Complicated to start with, things get more tricky as everyone including Alberto's clinging mother descend on the small town where the chosen man lives. Even Alberto's biological inventions come in useful.—Jeremy Perkins {J-26}"
The Great Escape,1963,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0057115/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Allied prisoners of war plan for several hundred of their number to escape from a German camp during World War II. Based on a true story, a group of allied escape artist-type prisoners-of-war are all put in an ""escape proof"" camp. Their leader decides to try to take out several hundred all at once. The first half of the movie is played for comedy, as the prisoners mostly outwit their jailers to dig the escape tunnel. The second half is high adventure as they use planes, trains, and boats to get out of occupied Europe.—John Vogel <jlvogel@comcast.net> In 1942, the Germans have built what they consider an escape-proof P.O.W. camp, where they plan to house all the problem P.O.W.s (those that have made multiple escape attempts in the past). What the Germans don't realize is that they've put all the best escape minds in one location. If they can't escape, these P.O.W.s believe it is their military duty to make the enemy place as much effort into their confinement as possible to divert them from other war-related pursuits. Royal Air Force Squadron Leader Bartlett plans not just a one or two man escape at a time like most escape attempts in the past have been, but a massive escape of two hundred fifty men through a series of tunnels. If one tunnel is found, they can focus on the others. Each escapee will be provided with a complete set of forged documents and standard clothing. With their reputations preceding them, each P.O.W. is assigned a specific task in carrying out the plan. Somewhat outside of the plot are Captain Hilts and Flying Officer Ives, who spent their first thirty days in camp in the cooler together. They who are unofficially assigned as the decoys who will make more rudimentary escape attempts. They ask Hilts to make a more serious task of reconnaissance of the local town if he ever does successfully escape, which of course means his recapture to bring the information back into camp and more time in the cooler. Beyond basic logistical problems and the Germans finding out what's going on, they have potential problems in certain P.O.W.s who may become liabilities dealing with their own personal issues.—Huggo Nazi Germany, 1942. With the Germans forced to spend time and resources hunting down escaping Allied officers, the Third Reich opened Stalag Luft III: a maximum-security, Luftwaffe-run POW camp. And designed to discourage even the craftiest prisoners, the Nazis moved truckloads of downed fighter pilots to the newly established prison camp. However, they have unwittingly assembled a dream team of escape artists. As the indomitable human spirit meets the dogged determination to be free, the hand-picked inmates waste no time sniffing out weaknesses and minute opportunities for escape--after all, it is the sworn duty of all officers to give the enemy hell and try to escape. Are the mighty oppressors prepared for the great escape?—Nick Riganas The Nazis, exasperated at the number of escapes from their prison camps by a relatively small number of Allied prisoners, relocate them to a high-security ""escape-proof"" camp to sit out the remainder of the war. Undaunted, the prisoners plan one of the most ambitious escape attempts of World War II. Based on a true story.—Kevin Ackley <kackley1@aol.com> The year is 1943. During World War II, the Germans have built a special Stalag, or prison camp, designed to house their most troublesome prisoners of war, the ones who make repeated escape attempts. Arriving at the new camp, many of the mostly British prisoners begin immediately to assess its security and begin planning escapes. One American prisoner, Capt. Virgil Hilts (Steve McQueen) quickly finds a place along the fence where it was difficult for the German guards in the towers to see, and casually tosses his ever-present baseball toward the fence in order to test the Germans, and stepping over the warning wire gets a few machine-gun bullets fired at his feet. Others try different escape tactics; several hide themselves in trucks full of brush as they drive towards the gate, and two of the men even try infiltrating a group of Russian workers marching out of the camp, while two men stage a fight as a diversion. All are quickly found and rooted out, with Hilts and a Scotsman named Archibald Ives being thrown into the ""cooler"", a isolation cell at the far side of the camp. All this in the first 20 minutes after they arrive. Hilts and Ives become friends during their stay in the cooler.After the initial excitement, the POW's begin to make more cohesive plans. The ranking officer of the group, Capt. Ramsey (James Donald) has a meeting with the German Commandant, who assures him escape is impossible, and it would be in everyone's best interest if they would all accept their situation, settle down, and sit out the remainder of the war ""as comfortably as possible"". Ramsey must however remind the Commandant that it is the sworn duty of all the prisoners to try to escape, thus forcing the Germans to use their finite resources and manpower guarding the prisoners, or chasing them down if they succeed in escaping.A few hours later, SS men bring Squadron Leader Roger Bartlett (Richard Attenborough) to the camp, as he is a Royal Air Force officer and therefore the responsibility of the Luftwaffe, not the SS. The SS officer promises Bartlett that he will be shot if he is caught escaping again, and then leaves. Bartlett, the leader of many prior escape attempts and nicknamed ""Big X"" by the other British officers, realizes that by putting all their problem prisoners in one camp, the Germans have unwittingly created a fine escape team. Between them, the POW's have considerable experience in tunneling, and have made many escape attempts. Bartlett quickly organizes everyone into teams and get them all to work. Some, like Lt. ""Tunnel King"" Danny Velinski (Charles Bronson) begin digging, while Lt. Bob ""Scrounger"" Hendley (James Garner) begins to gather the materials needed to make everything work for an audacious escape by up to 250 prisoners, far more than had ever escaped at once before. Other men are assigned to make uniforms, forge paperwork, and get to know the German guards and their habits. Bartlett plans to dig three tunnels, over 300 feet long, so that there will be other tunnels to use if one is discovered.After a couple of weeks in the cooler, Hilts and Ives are released, and meet with the others. Hilts has his own plan to dig out, a idea that is so simple it just might work, and he intends to try it that night. Wishing him the best, the main team realizes that Hilts may not succeed, but he'll at least distract the Germans from the other attempts. Hilts and Ives start under the fence that night, but they are caught and the next morning they are back in the cooler again.Meanwhile, other prisoners are working on the main escape attempt. Lt. Colin Blythe (Donald Pleasence) is the forger of the group, and works on fake I.D. papers, while the Aussie Sedgwick (James Coburn) creates amazing tools from scrap metal scavenged around the camp. Lt. Eric Ashley-Pitt (David McCallum) has figured out a way to get rid of all the dirt they're bringing up out of the tunnels, by placing it in bags inside their pants, and then scattering it outside. Hundreds of other men help out in other ways. Some establish gardens where dirt may be scattered, and also receive gardening tools that can be repurposed for the escape. Some scavenge wood and other materials from unused beds. Other men march, sing, and otherwise make noise to drown out the sounds made by the men making equipment and digging. Many men act as lookouts, passing signals when the guards approach, so that the men working have plenty of time to shut down their operations without being noticed. Others stage diversions to distract the Germans so that tools and other items may be stolen. Still others simply get in the way, hindering the Germans' routine inspections and gaining precious minutes for the others to avoid being caught.Hendley befriends a young, naive German guard named Werner. He tempts Werner into sharing coffee and chocolate with him, and takes the opportunity to steal Werner's wallet, knowing that Werner does not dare report the theft, since doing so would effectively be admitting socializing with prisoners, an offense which would get him sent to possible death on the Eastern Front. The wallet contains, among other items, Werner's identity card, military paperwork, an Ausweis (permission to be on government property), all items that the forgers need for their work. Later, Hendley is able to use the theft to blackmail Werner into providing him with a camera that Blythe requested. The tunnels get a few feet longer every day, despite stress and fraying tempers, repeated German inspections, and the occasional cave-in underground. The men go to increasing lengths to gather more and more wood to shore up the tunnels. Bartlett decides to concentrate all their efforts on one tunnel for the time being.Hilts is released from the cooler again, and meets with Bartlett. He says he intends to try again on July 7, the next new moon. Bartlett tells Hilts that the men working on the main escape plan still know little of the local geography, and asks Hilts to help by making maps of the area around the camp when he escapes, also getting information about the schedules at the nearest train station, even if it means being caught and returned to the cooler. Hilts prefers to act as a ""lone wolf"" or with his friend Ives, and refuses outright. He and the other Americans in the camp begin to distill alcohol from potatoes grown in the gardens. On the 4th of July, they surprise everyone with gallons of moonshine. A much-needed party breaks out as the prisoners gather outside for a few drinks, while the Germans look on with consternation, having missed the party preparations completely. However, the guards discover the first tunnel during a routine inspection that day. At the height of their celebration the men are suddenly crushed to learn that their greatest hope of escape is now gone. Ives, who had been slowly losing hope, finally cracks and charges the fence, only to be shot and killed. Bitterly resigned, Bartlett tersely tells the men to continue quietly on one of the other tunnels. Hilts, having seen his friend gunned down, changes his mind and decides to help Bartlett, by making the maps he needs. He escapes at the blind spot he saw at the beginning, and turns himself in the next day. Though he's sent to the cooler again, he has the information that Bartlett needed.Work continues on the second tunnel at a frantic pace. The men practice their assumed identities and their German, including one man taking a grave risk by dressing as a German soldier (he could be shot as a spy if caught this way). Blythe discovers that his eyesight has been ruined by all the close-up forging work; he cannot see more than a few inches from his face. He tries to hide his disability from the others, but he does not fool anyone. Danny admits to his friend Willie that he is claustrophobic, and cannot take the fear of digging in the tunnels any longer, and intends to try to escape through the fence. Willie talks him out of it, promising to stay with Danny all the way during the escape. Likewise, Hendley promises to take care of Blythe during the escape, despite Bartlett's misgiving about letting the blind Blythe escape. By the time Hilts is released again, the main group is nearly ready. Their clothes have been tailored to make them look like civilians, they have their fake IDs and other forged papers, and they know where to run, thanks to Hilts.That night is the night of the escape. In the tunnels, Danny's claustrophobia gets the better of him, and he returns to the hut, though he will escape later. Hilts digs the last few feet up to the surface at the end of the tunnel and cautiously pokes his head out, but he finds they've miscalculated; they're 20 feet short of the woods, and now they must try to sneak across open ground without being seen. All the forged travel permits bear the next day's date; they cannot postpone without starting the plan over from scratch. Hilts sets up a rope signal from the woods, and men start to enter the tunnel. Carefully timing the passes of the guards, men begin to escape into the woods. During an air raid, the Germans turn off all the lights, enabling many men to escape during the period of darkness. Afterward, they return to the rope signal. This is a time-consuming process, and Bartlett and his friend Mac must leave their post at the end of the tunnel if they intend to catch their train, passing the instructions regarding the rope signal from man to man. One man stumbles upon exiting the hole, and a guard hears him, though he does not see anything. The next man grows impatient waiting for the rope signal, which Hilts cannot give until the guard leaves the area. He makes a run for it anyway, and the guard sees him, thus stopping the breakout. In the morning, the Germans do a head count and determine that 76 prisoners escaped.Guards and police scour the countryside looking for the prisoners. As the morning train pulls into the station, many of the men are waiting in their disguises, and they quietly get aboard. Others are making their getaway by other means. Sedgwick, the Australian, steals a bicycle. Hilts strings a wire across a rural road, knocking a German soldier off his motorcycle, which Hilts then steals, along with the German's uniform. He heads for neutral Switzerland. Danny and Willie find a rowboat and begin rowing downriver. Others follow the roads, walking or hitchhiking. One is picked up quickly at a roadblock, and as the day progresses, many other prisoners are recaptured, one by one.On the train, the men discover that the Gestapo and the SS are on board. Bartlett and Mac pose as Frenchmen and fool the police; Hendley and Blythe jump from the train instead rather than take the risk. Meanwhile, Sedgwick stows away on board another train. Hilts kicks a German policeman at a roadblock and makes a brazen escape on his stolen motorcycle, eventually losing his pursuers on a farm, where he discards the uniform. He eventually comes within sight of the Swiss border, but finding the crossing heavily guarded, makes a run for it cross country on the motorcycle. Again, the Germans chase him. Cornered at the border fence, he makes a daring jump over the fence but becomes entangled in the barbed wire, and surrenders, showing the Germans his dog tag so that they do not think he is a spy.The first train reaches its destination; Bartlett, Mac, and Ashley-Pitt disembark to get ready for the next leg of their trip. The SS officer who threatened Bartlett with death at the beginning just happens to be there, and he recognizes Bartlett. Ashley-Pitt, realizing what is happening, tackles the officer and shoots him with his own gun, even though he knows he will be quickly shot dead by other policemen in the vicinity, he has sacrificed his own life to save Bartlett. Hendley and Blythe, traveling overland, arrive at an air base, ambush a guard and steal a small airplane, although they are seen doing so. They fly towards Switzerland. Unfortunately, the plane develops mechanical problems before they get there, and the plane crashes. Hendley and Blythe are not seriously injured, but German soldiers arrive on the scene almost immediately. Blythe cannot see them, and they shoot him dead. Hendley is recaptured.Sedgwick, now in France, witnesses three German soldiers killed in a drive-by shooting at an outdoor cafe by French resistance guerrillas. The proprietor, who was in on the ""hit"", agrees to help Sedgwick escape to Spain. Meanwhile, Bartlett and Mac, still posing as Frenchmen, attempt to board a bus for the next leg of their trip. Mac is tricked when a Gestapo officer addresses him in English, and Mac makes the mistake of replying in English, blowing their cover. He and Bartlett must make a run for it. Mac is quickly cornered. Bartlett almost gets away, deceiving several soldiers by speaking perfect German when they confront him. Unfortunately, a nearby SS officer recognized him as having spoken French earlier, and he is recaptured.Eventually, most of the escapees have been rounded up by the Gestapo. As they ride back towards the camp in trucks, fifty prisoners are diverted in another direction, where Bartlett, who'd led all his men in the escape, confesses that even though they've failed the affair has been exhilarating. ""I've never been happier"", he says during a rest stop in an open field. The prisoners turn at the sound of a machine gun bolt, and as they stand helpless, the Gestapo guards gun them all down in cold-blooded murder. The remaining captured prisoners are returned to the camp, and the names of those murdered are read off in a memorial service. Three prisoners escape. Danny and Willie eventually reach a seaport in their rowboat and board a ship bound for Sweden, while the French guerrillas help Sedgwick to the Spanish border, where another man meets him to guide him into Spain.The Commandant of the prison camp is cashiered and taken away in disgrace, and replaced by another officer, punishment for the escape happening on his watch. At the same time, Hilts is returned to the camp. Bruised, bloody, but unbowed, he marches defiantly back into the camp and learns of the murder of most of the other escapees. Staggered at the news, he is hauled off to the cooler. He is locked up in his usual room, and the guard hears Hilts playing with his baseball. The German, who doesn't understand baseball, walks away. The movie ends with the notice that it is dedicated to the fifty men who were murdered."

The Birds,1963,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0056869/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A wealthy San Francisco socialite pursues a potential boyfriend to a small Northern California town that slowly takes a turn for the bizarre when birds of all kinds suddenly begin to attack people. Melanie Daniels is the modern rich socialite, part of the jet-set who always gets what she wants. When lawyer Mitch Brenner sees her in a pet shop, he plays something of a practical joke on her, and she decides to return the favor. She drives about an hour north of San Francisco to Bodega Bay, where Mitch spends the weekends with his mother Lydia and younger sister Cathy. Soon after her arrival, however, the birds in the area begin to act strangely. A seagull attacks Melanie as she is crossing the bay in a small boat, and then, Lydia finds her neighbor dead, obviously the victim of a bird attack. Soon, birds in the hundreds and thousands are attacking anyone they find out of doors. There is no explanation as to why this might be happening, and as the birds continue their vicious attacks, survival becomes the priority.—garykmcd San Francisco based socialite Melanie Daniels, whose father is a newspaper publisher and whose mother ran off when Melanie was eleven, used to lead a fast and carefree life, although she is trying now to do useful and meaningful work with her time. The two holdovers from her old life are that fast and loose reputation, and playing practical jokes at whatever cost and whatever expense the outcome. It is on a prank, this time on her, that she officially meets criminal lawyer Mitch Brenner, the prank largely centered on the topic of birds. Wanting to repay him for the prank, Melanie drives to his weekend home up the coast outside the working class community of Bodega Bay to surprise him, there where he lives with his widowed mother and his eleven year old sister, Lydia Brenner and Cathy Brenner. While Cathy likes Melanie, Lydia is distant toward her, much like she is toward any woman interested in Mitch, such as the local schoolteacher, Annie Hayworth, who originally moved to Bodega Bay from San Francisco four years ago as Mitch's girlfriend at the time. The day of Melanie's arrival in Bodega Bay, a number of odd occurrences happen all with respect to birds, one of those incidents being a sole seagull swooping down and giving her one good peck on the head. With Melanie still in town, the bird occurrences become more frequent, massive and violent, they seemingly wanting to kill. Mitch notices that the attacks go in waves and are generally in the same pattern of the birds massing quietly, attacking all of a sudden then disappearing to mass again quietly somewhere else. Melanie and the Brenners have to decide how long to stay in Bodega Bay before it becomes too dangerous, by which time it may be too late.—Huggo Spoiled socialite and notorious practical joker Melanie Daniels is shopping in a San Francisco pet store when she meets Mitch Brenner, who is looking to buy a pair of love birds for his young sister's birthday; he recognizes Melanie but pretends to mistake her for an assistant. She decides to get her own back by buying the birds and driving up to the quiet coastal town of Bodega Bay, where Mitch spends his weekends with his sister and mother. Shortly after she arrives, Melanie is attacked by a gull, but this is just the start of a series of attacks by an increasing number of birds.—Col Needham <col@imdb.com> When Melanie Daniels is crossing a lake, she is nipped by a gull. Gradually, incidents of bird attacks on humans by pecking increases. Glass windows splinter as birds dive into them, children are sent home from school to safety, townspeople take refuge in a lunchroom, Ms. Daniels is trapped in a phone booth, and, finally, everyone hides in homes tightly boarded up against repeated attacks by the birds before finding some semblance of safety.—filmfactsman Melanie Daniels (Tippi Hedren) is a young San Francisco socialite whose wealthy father owns a large newspaper. As the film opens, Melanie is visiting a pet shop to buy a mynah bird for her aunt. While in the pet shop, she meets a man named Mitch Brenner (Rod Taylor) who mistakes her for a shop clerk. Melanie pretends to sell him a pair of lovebirds, until Mitch reveals that he knew her name all along; Mitch is a lawyer who recognizes Melanie from a court appearance where one of her practical jokes backfired and resulted in a damaged window. Melanie is incensed and uses Mitch's license plate number to find out his identity and address. The next day, she buys Mitch a pair of lovebirds and attempts to deliver them to his apartment, but when she tries to leave the birds in his hallway, a neighbor (Richard Deacon) tells her that Mitch spends his weekends at his family home in a small town up the coast called Bodega Bay, and won't return until Monday.Not wanting to let her joke go, Melanie decides to journey to Bodega Bay; she drives up the coast and questions a general store owner in the little town about Mitch's family. He points across the bay to the Brenners' house where Mitch is staying with his mother, Lydia (Jessica Tandy) and his 11-year-old sister Cathy (Veronica Cartwright). The shopkeeper knows it is Cathy's birthday, but cannot remember the girl's name. Melanie gets the idea to gift the birds to Cathy in order to further embarrass Mitch; to confirm the girl's name, the shopkeeper directs Melanie to the home of the local school teacher, Annie Hayworth (Suzanne Pleshette). Annie is a lovely woman around Melanie's age, and she understands immediately that Melanie came here to flirt with Mitch.Melanie returns to town and takes a skiff across the bay to the private dock of the Brenner house, sneaking inside and leaving the bird cage in the living room with a note identifying them as a gift for Cathy. When she sneaks back down to her boat, Mitch spots her making her escape and drives around the bay to intercept her at the dock. Before Melanie reaches the dock, a seagull swoops down and gashes her forehead, seemingly in a deliberate attack.Mitch takes Melanie to a local diner to tend to her wound. Not wanting Mitch to realize the lengths to which she went to get his attention, she lies and tells him that her primary reason for coming to Bodega Bay was to visit Annie, a friend of hers from school. While they are there, Lydia arrives and Mitch introduces her to Melanie; Lydia's response to Melanie is icy, especially when Mitch invites her to the house for dinner that night. Melanie, who was not planning on staying for the night, returns to Annie's and rents a room in her house for the evening. Annie welcomes Melanie, but is also jealous of the interest Melanie has in Mitch.At dinner, Melanie meets Cathy, who is ecstatic about the lovebirds. As Melanie and Mitch make small talk, Lydia phones a man who sold her chicken feed. She complains that her chickens will not eat it, and that there must be something wrong with the feed because the neighbor's chickens are behaving the same way. She ends the conversation puzzled after learning that her neighbors bought a different brand of feed, indicating that the problem is not with the feed but with the chickens. After dinner, Mitch walks Melanie back to her car and they discuss Melanie's past. Mitch teases her about a sensational story that was reported in the social pages about her, and Melanie becomes indignant. He exposes the fact that she lied to him about being old friends with Annie, and Melanie drives off in a huff. Mitch notices a flock of birds lurking menacingly in the dark on a telephone wire near the house.Back at Annie's, Melanie shares a drink with her, and Annie reveals that she and Mitch were lovers once. The cool reception she got from Lydia spoiled their affair, but she relocated to Bodega Bay anyway, wanting to be near Mitch. Mitch calls to apologize and invites Melanie to Cathy's birthday party the next day. Melanie agrees to come and hangs up. She and Annie hear a thump at the front door and find a dead seagull on the porch, wondering how it could have lost its way in the dark when the moon is so bright.The next day at the birthday party, Melanie reveals to Mitch that she is estranged from her mother. She seems envious that Lydia is so close with Mitch, when her own mother abandoned the family. Melanie does not even know her mother's whereabouts. Suddenly, as the children are playing a game, seagulls attack the birthday party, landing on the children and pecking at them. The adults get the children to safety without much incident, but Mitch asks Melanie to wait until after dinner to leave for San Francisco. As they sit in the living room after eating, a flock of swifts invades the home, getting in through the chimney. Mitch gets the birds out of the house, but everyone is shaken, especially Lydia, who seems more fragile than ever. Melanie decides to stay the night.The next morning, Lydia takes Cathy to school and then drops by her neighbor's farm to discuss the matter of the chickens. She finds him dead in his house, his body bloodied and his eyes missing. The windows are shattered and the room is littered with dead seagulls and crows. Lydia rushes back home in shock. While Mitch and the authorities investigate her report of the dead body, Lydia retires to her bed and has a conversation with Melanie. The two of them seem to reach an understanding, and Lydia opens up to her, revealing that after the death of her husband, her greatest fear is that Mitch will abandon her. Melanie offers to bring Cathy home from school when Lydia worries about the possibility of another bird attack.At the school, Annie is leading the children in a song while Melanie waits outside, not wanting to interrupt them. Little by little, crows gather in the playground until the place is swarming with menacing black birds. Melanie warns Annie, and the two of them lead the children out of the school, but the birds hear their feet on the pavement and attack. Melanie, Cathy, and one of Cathy's friends become separated from the others, and Melanie ushers the children into a nearby parked car, when the bird attack suddenly subsides.At the town diner, Melanie calls her father to report the phenomenon of the bird attacks. Her story attracts a lot of attention, but most people are skeptical, including Mrs. Bundy (Ethel Griffie), an elderly woman who is an expert in ornithology. She dismisses Melanie's account as impossible, and contends that birds could never launch a massed attack on humanity because they lack the intelligence. Mitch along with Deputy Al joins them and backs up Melanie's story, but they are met with more skepticism until another bird attack occurs, this one even greater in scale than the previous ones. This time, all types of birds are involved, and they create havoc resulting in a large explosion at Bodega Bay's gas station. After it subsides, the patrons of the diner are terrified, and one woman becomes hysterical, accusing Melanie of causing the attacks.Melanie and Mitch go to fetch Cathy at Annie's house, only to find Annie dead in her front yard, a victim of the bird attack. Cathy is safe inside the house, and she tells them that Annie pushed her inside when the birds came, unable to save herself. Back at the Brenner house, Mitch works at barricading the windows and doors in anticipation of another bird attack. Mitch, Cathy, Melanie and Lydia all spend hours inside the house until the sounds of a massive assault on the house reach them. Mitch is barely able to keep the birds from breaking through the barricades, large birds pecking through the wooden reinforcements, and the power to the house is cut. Finally the attack subsides, and the four of them drop off to sleep.Later, Melanie is awakened by a sound from upstairs. She takes a flashlight and is drawn to an upstairs bedroom. When she opens the door, she is confronted by birds that have torn a massive hole in the ceiling and have roosted in the room. They trap Melanie and attack her, pecking at her flesh and clothes. Melanie attempts to fight them off but weakens. The commotion draws the others and they pull her out of the room, but she is badly wounded and in shock. Mitch and Lydia bandage Melanie as best they can, and resolve to escape in order to get her medical attention. Mitch goes outside to prepare the car and opens the door to find the house completely surrounded by rustling birds, as far as the eye can see. True to the unpredictable nature of the phenomenon, the birds allow them to escape in the car and they drive off among the sea of birds and away from Bodega Bay to find help and safety."

Inspector Clouseau, an expert on The Phantom's exploits, feels sure that he knows where The Phantom will strike next and leaves Paris for Switzerland, where the famous Lugashi jewel 'The Pink Panther' is going to be.

This huge pink gem has an unusual flaw: looking deeply into the stone, one perceives a tiny discoloration resembling a leaping pink panther hence the name. As the camera moves in, this image comes to life and participates in the credits. When Dala is a young woman, rebels seize power in Lugash and then demand possession of the jewel, but the exiled princess refuses to hand it over.Dala (Claudia Cardinale) relaxes on holiday at an exclusive skiing resort in Cortina d'Ampezzo, where noted British playboy Sir Charles Lytton (David Niven), who leads a secret life as a jewel thief called ""The Phantom"", has his eyes on the Pink Panther. His American playboy nephew, George (Robert Wagner), follows his uncle to the resort hoping to steal the jewel and blame it on the Phantom, not realizing that the Phantom is his uncle.On the Phantom's trail is the klutzy French police inspector Jacques Clouseau (Peter Sellers) of the Sûreté, whose wife Simone (Capucine) is unknown to him the paramour of Charles and helper in the Phantom's crimes. Clouseau tries to stop the theft attempts, but he is so clueless and clumsy that when several attempts are made at a fancy-dress party, he looks everywhere but the right place. Throughout the film, scenes at the skiing resort's hotel show Madame Clouseau dodging her husband while trying both to carry out Sir Charles' plans and to avoid George, who is enamoured of her.In spite of himself, the buffoonish inspector captures Sir Charles and his accomplice George when they both try to steal the diamond during a costume party.

Simone offers to help Dala by taking possession of the diamond and decides to help out Sir Charles and George when they are put on trial for the theft. Conviction looks inevitable until Princess Dala and Simone hatch a plan to frame Clouseau. The defense calls a surprised Clouseau to the stand as their lone witness. The barrister asks a series of questions that suggest Clouseau himself could be the Phantom. The unnerved Clouseau pulls his handkerchief out of his shirt pocket revealing the jewel planted there by Madame Clouseau.As Clouseau is being driven away to prison, a regretful Simone expresses fears that he will rot in prison. Sir Charles points out that ""it takes years for people to rot; and when the Phantom strikes again, he'll be free as a bird."" Sir Charles, Simone, and George drive away together as a united team to continue their life of crime elsewhere, and Dala leaves to go back to her country.In the police car, the officers tell Clouseau that as ""The Phantom"", he is a ""national hero"" and a sex idol for millions of young women, and add that they are very envious of him. When they ask him, with some deference, how he committed all those robberies, Clouseau, defeated and bewildered and apparently still unaware about his wife's betrayal (but happy to realize that in a few years, when he is released, he will have all the women in the world after him), sighs and smiles a little then replies, ""Well you know... it wasn't easy.""The film ends when the cartoon character of the Pink Panther (works as a police officer), gets run over by a police car, then gets back up and shows ""The End"" title but instead it's ""ThEnd"" but then fixes it to ""The End"" after a sound of the police car crashing into something then closes the film."

After the vet leaves Hud remarks, ""You gonna let them shoot your cows out from underneath you on account of a schoolbook disease? You getting that old Homer?"" Homer: I wonder if a long quarantine wouldn't satisfy them? You think they'd agree to that?
Hud: They don't have to agree to nothing. They're the LAW. You can agree with 'em 'til Hell freezes over for all the good it'll do ya.
Hud proposes that Homer sell all the cattle before the inspector comes back.
Homer: Would that be your way of getting out of a tight? Hud: Ship the whole herd out before they begin the tests!
Homer: You mean, try and pass bad stuff off on to my neighbors who wouldn't even know what they was getting? Hud: You don't know it's bad stuff. I'd ship 'em out of state. Load them up north before the news gets out.
Homer: And take a chance on starting an epidemic in the entire country? Hud: Why, this whole country is run on epidemics, where you been? Epidemics are big business, price fixing, crooked TV shows, income tax finagling, souped up expense accounts. How many honest men you know? You take the sinners away from the saints, you're lucky to end up with Abraham Lincoln. Now I say let us put our bread into some of that gravy while it is still hot. Homer: You're an unprincipled man Hud. Hud: Don't let that flush ya. I mean, you got enough for both of us.While the cattle are rounded up, Hud notices Homer is having a tough time. He suggests Homer go take a nap but Homer insists ""I'll hold up my end of it."" Lon comes out to help with the round up. Lon talks about the rarity of a couple longhorn steer that Homer keeps for nostalgic reasons, and suggests they turn them loose. Homer insists that they have to go with the rest. Homer and Lon go out to see a movie and Homer keeps dozing off. After the movie they go to a diner for desert and Hud happens to walk in with Mrs. Peters. Homer asks Lon if he's with Truman Peters' wife. Lon says yes and offers to call Hud over, but Homer tells him to leave him alone. Hud walks over with her anyway, introducing Mrs. Peters to Homer, who shakes her hand and then looks at his plate. Hud points out that Homer hasn't asked them to sit down, explaining that her being married offends Homer's ""high priciples and what have you."" WHile Hud is talking Homer suddenly slumps and looks ill. Hud and Lon get him to the car right away to go home. Lon reasons that he must have got too much sun. Homer falls asleep and Hud and Lon talk.
Lon: I forget how old he is. I just don't want to think about it.
Hud: It's time you started.
Lon: I know he's gonna die someday. I know that much.
Hud: He is.
Lon: Makes me feel like somebody dumped me into a cold river.
Hud: Happens to everybody, horses, dogs, men. Nobody gets out of life alive.Lon helps Homer into the house and Hud sees Alma come home. He goes to her room to visit her, looking through items she's won in contests to make conversation. He tells her ""You're a good housekeeper, a good cook. You're a good laundress. What else you good at? [sitting down and leaning on her bed]
Alma: [sitting on the other side of the bed] Taking care of myself.
Hud: Shouldn't have to, a woman that looks like you do.
Alma: That's what my ex husband used to tell me before he took my wallet, my gasoline credit card and left me stranded in a downtown hotel in Albequerque New Mexico.
Hud: What'd you do to make him take to the hills, wear your curlers to bed?
Alma: Ed's a gambler. He's probably up at Vegas arena right now, dealing at night, losing it all back in the daytime.
Hud: A man like that sounds no better than a heel.
Alma: Aren't you all?
Hud: Hony, don't go shooting all the dogs because one of em's got fleas.
Alma: I was married to Ed for six years. The only thing he was eve good for was to scratch my back where I couldn't reach it.
Hud: You still got that itch?
Alma: Off and on.
Hud: Well, let me know when it gets to bothering ya. Alma smiles and Hud makes his exit.The next day the vet starts injecting fresh cows with specimens taken from Homer's herd. From there they have to wait 6 days to look for symptoms to develop. Lon ends up getting kicked in the head by one of the cows, passing out when he tries to get back to work. Hud carries him to the house and puts him in bed. Alma suggests they call a doctor but Hud insists they don't need one. She checks on him in bed and he tells Alma how beautiful she is. She encourages him to go to sleep. The cattle are penned in for quarantine and signs put up around the property. Lon wakes up the next day ready to work, but Homer tells him there isn't anything to do until the quarantine is over. Hud takes exception, telling Homer they're just letting the government throw dirt in their faces. He mockingly refers to the family as ""poor but honest.""Hud asks Alma where his Jack Daniels is, although he already looks drunk. She tells him he already drank it. He comes up behind her and nuzzles her neck. She tells him she ""doesn't like sudden passes."" He warns here that ""there's another one coming up on your right."" before moving to the other side of her neck. She says ""Don't you ever ask?"" Hud says ""The only question I ever ask any woman is 'What time is your husband coming home?'"" He suggests they ""get their shoelaces untied."" ALma says she's ""been asked with a little more finesse."" She doesn't tell him to stop, but Hud quickly moves away and says ""I wouldn't want to come on crude."" He offers to bring her some perfume and she adds a few items to the list, including colored beads and wampum. Hud says ""Whatever it takes to make you trade."" Alma replies ""No thanks. I've done my time with one cold blooded bastard. I'm not looking for another."" Hud replies, ""It's too late honey. You already found him.""The next morning Hud invites everyone to watch him at the ""pig scramble."" making a dig at Alma in the prcess saying ""They're letting ladies in free. You might just qualify."" She doesn't answer the remark but Lon tells Homer it's the first time Hud's ever asked him to go anywhere and he wonders why. Homer says ""Lonesome I imagine, just trying to scare up a little company.""
Lon: Hud, lonesome? He can get more women coming in than anyone else around.
Homer: That ain't necessarily much. It ain't necessarily company neither. Women just like to be around something dangerous part of the time. Even Hud can get lonesome once in a while. Alma listens to the conversation silently while washing dishes, but when Homer and Lon decide to go, she says ""I'll stay home. I don't like pigs.""At the pig scramble, Hud joins a contest to catch greased pigs and wins. Afterwards Hud invites Lon and Homer to go out with him. Homer declines but Lon takes him up on it. Hud offers to buy Lon a drink. The two sit in a diner together and Hud offers to spike Lon's drink with whiskey, which he eagerly agrees to even encouraging Hud not to be sparing about it. Lon notices an attractive woman. Hud encourages him to approach her, but Lon says he wouldn't make a move at her. Hud asks ""Well why not? You ain't nailed down, are ya?"" He encourages him more saying ""Get all the good you can out of 17 because it sure wears out in one hell of a hurry."" Lon: My trouble is I need to like a girl a lot before I can work up to anything. I mean like her as a person."" Hud: Honcho, you're a regular idealist.
Lon: What's wrong with that?
Hud: I don't know. I just ain't never tried it. Lon: I suppose you think I'm a jerk. Hud: WHat do you care what i think?
Lon: This is probably gonna hand you a big laugh... but I do.
Hud: Then have another little drink, and I'll have another little drink. Then maybe we can work up some real family feeling here.Lon gets up to put change in the jukebox, and while he's doing that he makes a point of looking at the lady they were admiring. This isn't appreciated by her boyfriend, who starts threatening him. Hud gets involved and ends up sucker punching the man. Both Lon and Hud end up getting into it and get the bar into an uproar. The two head home afterwards and Hud tells Lon it felt like old times mentioning Lon's dad. Hud tells Lon ""When you ain't bein' a pain in the tail, you remind me a lot of him."" Hud starts talking about Norman (Lon's dad) remembering an episode where they got drunk and Norman convinced him that he could hear the grass grow. He tells Lon that was the night he crashed a car, killing Norman and walking away without a scratch himself. Hud expects the story will change Lon's opinion of him, but it doesn't. The two of them walk into the house singing loudly. Homer hears them and can tell they're drunk. He asks Lon ""What else has he give you a taste for?"" Homer tells Hud he doesn't have a problem with Lon having a drink, but Hud Hud asks what's bothering him.
Homer: You, Hud. Like always.
Lon: Hey, waht are you climbing on Hud foor?
Homer: Yo think a lot of Hud, do ya? You think he's a real man. Well, you're being took in. Hud: You listen to him honcho. He's my daddy and he knows...
Homer: I know ya. You're smart. You got your share of guts. You can talk a man into trusting ya, and a woman into wanting ya. Hud: I got it made ain't I? Homer: To hear you tell it.
Hud: Why don't you get it off your chest. What's been griping ya all this time is what I dne to Norman,
Homer: You were drunk and careless of your brother. Hud: You had fifteen years to get over it, that's half of my life. Homer: That's not our quarrel and never has been.
Hud: The hell it isn't.
Homer: No, boy. I was sick of you a long time before that. Hud: Well, isn't life full of surprises? All along, I thought it was because of what I done to my big brother. Homer: I took that hard, but I buried it. Hud: Well alright I'll bite. What turned you sour on me? Not that I give a damn. Homer: Just that Hud, you don't give a damn. That's all. That's the whole of it. You still don't get it, do ya? You don't care about people Hud. You don't give a damn about em. You got all that charm going for ya and it makes the youngsters want to be like ya. That's the shame of it, because ya don't value nothin'. You don't respect nothin'. You keep no check on your appetites at all. You live just for yourself and that makes ya not fit to live with.
Hud: My Momma loved me, but she died.
Hud leaves and Lon tells Homer he shouldn't pick on Hud, as everyone around is like him in some way. Homer tells him ""That's no cause for rejoicing. Little by little the look of the country changes because of the men we admire""
Lon: I still think you nailed him pretty hard.
Homer: Did I? Maybe. Old people get as hard as their arteries. You're just going to have to make up your own mind one day, about what's right and what's wrong.Lon goes to check on Hud who's upset that Alma's asleep when he wants to eat something. Lon offers to cook something but Hud yells at him to leave while he has another drink.The next day Lon is out watching the rodeo. Hud stops by and finds him offering Lon ten dollars to get himself a good seat, and promises there's more money to come. Hud reveals that he's talked with a lawyer who told him ""There's a law that says when old folks can't cut the mustard anymore, you can make them let go, whether they like it or not."" Lon is disgusted with the idea and tries to return the ten dollars. Hud tries to explain that he just wants what he's worked for for years and says ""You don't look out for yourself, the only helping hand you'll ever get is when they lower the box."" Later on, Hud sits in his room drinking and watching TV. Homer comes in and confronts him about Lon has told him.Hud is proud to tell Homer that when the cattle situation is over, whatever happens ""you better get yourself a rocking chair and get out of my way."" Homer tells him there's no way he can get control of the property while he's above ground. Homer admits he might have made some mistakes and been too hard on Hud. Hud tells him ""You ain't never been wrong."" painting Homer as uncompromising and holier than thou, and the concluding ""So I just naturally had to go bad in the face of so much good."" Homer wonders how a man like Hud can be his son and leaves the room. Hud follows him yelling ""You've got the same feeling beneath your belt as any other man, that's how you got stuck with me for a son."" Lon hears the yelling and comes out of his room but Hud runs past him and heads to Alma's room when he sees her outside. SHe sees he's in rare form and runs inside, locking the door as fast as she can, but Hud kicks the door open and grabs her and starts kissing her forcibly, escalating as she struggles, meaning to rape her. Lon interrupts before that happens. Hud easily bests him, but can't bring hiself to punch Lon, so leaves instead.The next day the vet tells them that it is foot and mouth disease which means all of the animals have to be killed and quickly. The vet tries to cheer up Homer telling him he might sell some oil leases anyway. Hud speaks up about it saying ""My Daddy thinks that oil is something you stick in your salad dressing."" Homer says ""If there's oil down there, you can get it sucked up after I'm under there with it. But, I don't like it and I don't aim to have it. There'll be no holes punched in this land while I'm here. They ain't gonna come in here and grade no road so the wind can blow me away. What's oil to me? What can I do with a bunch of rotten oil wells? I can't ride out every day and prowl amongst 'em like I can my cattle. I can't breed 'em or tend 'em or rope 'em or chase 'em or nothing. I can't feel a smidgen of pride in 'em 'cause they ain't none of my doing. Hud says ""There's money in it."" Homer answers ""I don't want that kind of money. I want mine to come from something that keeps a man doing for himself.""They then have a big pit dug to herd the cattle into. Homer gets all of the help together with guns and they shoot all the cattle from above until they're all dead while Homer forces himself to oversee it. Lon remarks ""That didn't take long."" And Homer says ""It doesn't take long to kill things, not like it does to grow."" Bulldozers start filling in the hole with dirt. Homer still has his two Longhorn steer and is watching them and one of the government guys notices them as well and moves to enter their pen. Homer tells him he's going to kill them himself, but the man says ""There's no guarantee that you'll do it."" The vet hears the argument and calls the man off, willing to take Homer's word. He apologizes to Homer who remarks ""He ain't such a bad fella, just got a cruddy job."" Homer next lets all of his ranch hands go and asks for his rifle. He tells Lon ""I've chased them Longhorns many a mile. I don't know if I can kill 'em, but I guess I can."" He tells Lon to go somewhere else and shoots them both, needing a couple shots for each. Hud listens a little ways away and tells Lon ""Them old bulls are hard to kill.""Alma is packing her things to leave. Lon gives her a ride to the bus station and tries to talk her into staying. She tells him to take care of his grandfather and not to be lazy and gives him a hug. Hud happens to be passing the bus stop and sees her there. He apologizes saying ""Looks like we're losing a good cook. Maybe we should've boosted your salary a little. You ain't letting that little ruckus we had run you off?""
Alma: As far as I can get on a bus ticket.
Hud: You telling me i'm the first guy who ever stuck his foot in your door?
Alma: No.
Hud: First one who ever got rough huh? Well, I'm sorry. It ain't my style. I don't usually get rough with my women. I generally don't have to. Alma: You're rough on everybody.
Hud: So they tell me.
Alma: You want to know something funny? It would've happened eventually without the roughhouse. You look pretty good without your shirt on you know. The sight of that through the kitchen window made me put down my dish towel more than once. Hud: Why didn't you speak up sooner?
The bus pulls up and Alma gets on. Hud calls after her :I'll remember you honey. You're the one that got away.The bus takes off. Lon is driving home in the dark and Hud comes up speeding behind him. Hud bumps into Lon's car to nudge him. Lon sees Homer crawling across the road and slams his brakes sending his car off the road. Hud doesn't know what happened and yells at Lon telling him he'll be paying to fix the car for a long time. Lon tells him he saw Homer in the road and Hud rushes out to check.Homer is still conscious and tells them he fell off his horse. Hud tells Lon to take his car and go call for an ambulance, but when the car won't start Hud tells him to bring the whiskey. Homer tells them he feels like giving up. He tells Hud ""They're waiting on me. And he ain't a patient man."" Hud tells Lon that Homer's gone. Hud tells Lon that ""he couldn't have made it another hour, any way in the world."" Lon answers ""He could've if he'd wanted to. You fixed it so he didn't want to anymore.""
Hud: You don't know the whole story. Yeah, him and me fought many and many a round together, but I guess you could say that I helped him about as much as he ever helped me.
Lon: How did you help him Hud? By trying to sell him out? By taking the heart out of him? By making him give up and quit? Is that how you helped him?We next see Lon and Hud at Homer's funeral service. One of the mourners tells Lon ""Look at it this way, he's gone to a better place."" Lon says ""I don't think so. Not unless dirt is a better place than air."" Lon walks away. We then see Hud pulling into their property with his car still damaged. He sees lon walking around and tells him they buried Homer. Lon is carrying his things and Hud asks him where he's going.Lon tells Hud he's going somewhere else to work for awhile. Hud expresses concern that Lon's too green to make it on his own. He tells Lon a story about his grandfather giving him a Mars bar when he joined the army and telling him, ""Character's the only thing I got to give you. Be a man."" Lon answers ""Well I guess he was kind of worried, your trying so hard to get out of the draft and all."" Hud tells Lon that if he isn't succesful he can come back and work for him, but Lon says he won't be back. Hud tells him "" I guess you've come to be of your Granddaddy's opinion that I ain't fit to live with. That's too bad. Yeah, we mightta whooped it up some, you and me. That's the way you used to want it.""
Lon: I useta. So long, Hud.Lon starts walking again and Hud yells after him ""You know something Fantan? This world's so fulla crap, a man's gonna get into it sooner or later whether he's careful or not.""
Hud walks into the empty house and gets a drink. He lights a cigarette, looking out the open door in thought. He then waves and closes the door behind him as he goes back in the house."
The Prize,1963,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0057426/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"As the Nobel Prize winners come to Stockholm to receive their awards, their lives are overturned and perturbed in various ways. For some reason, this year's Nobel prize in literature has been awarded to the young author Andrew Craig, who seems to be more interested in women and drinking than writing. Another laureate is Dr. Max Stratman, the famous German-American physicist who comes to Stockholm for the award ceremony with his young and beautiful niece Emily. The Foreign Department also assigns him an assistant during his stay, Miss Andersson. Craig soon notices that Dr. Stratman is acting strangely. The second time they meet, Dr. Stratman does not even recognize him. Craig begins to investigate.—Mattias Thuresson It's sometime in the near future. This year's Nobel Prizes have just been announced with the recipients descending on Stockholm, all staying at the Grand Hotel. The recipients and their behind-the-scenes stories include: American Dr. John Garrett and Italian Dr. Carlo Farelli sharing the prize for medicine for their individual work on the same topic, with Dr. Garrett sure that Dr. Farelli somehow stole his work; husband and wife Frenchmen Drs. Claude and Denise Marceau sharing the prize for chemistry, while their marriage is basically non-existent, Claude's mistress Monique Souvir, about whom Denise knows, openly traveling with them as his secretary; American Dr. Max Stratman awarded the prize for physics, he who is accompanied by his now-adult niece Emily Stratman who he has not seen since she was a child and who may not know that he is being strong-armed to defect back to his homeland of East Germany against his will; and American Andrew Craig awarded the prize for literature, despite his six novels to date not having sold well, not having written anything in five years, having disdain for the award itself except the prize money, and being more renowned for his excessive lifestyle, especially with booze and women. As Craig is traveling by himself, the Swedish foreign office has assigned him a personal aide, the beautiful Inger Lisa Andersson, whose biggest job is to make sure he doesn't embarrass himself or by association the Nobel name. At a press conference, Craig admits that of late he has been making a living writing pulp-fiction detective novels under a pseudonym. His detective skills are put to the test when he gets embroiled in his fellow Nobel laureates' back issues, most specifically Dr. Stratman's. In the process, he has to convince Miss Andersson, with whom he is falling in love, of what he discovers, which includes a dead body, his own life in danger, and the kidnapping of Dr. Stratman, despite Dr. Stratman seemingly attending all the Nobel functions.—Huggo In Stockholm, Sweden to collect his Nobel Prize in Literature, American writer Andrew Craig stumbles across a plot to kidnap a fellow Nobel laureate. On arrival at the hotel, he meets physicist Prof. Max Stratman. They have a pleasant conversation and agree to meet for drinks the next day. When they meet again however, the Professor acts as if he's never met Craig. With his propensity for partying and drinking too much, Craig doesn't have a great deal of credibility with his hosts, including the person assigned to him by the Swedish Foreign Ministry, Inger Lisa Andersson. An attempt on Craig's life and a chance encounter at a local hospital provides the evidence he needs however.—garykmcd"
The Nutty Professor,1963,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0057372/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A timid, nearsighted chemistry teacher discovers a magical potion that can transform him into a suave and handsome Romeo. The Jekyll and Hyde game works well enough until the concoction starts to wear off at the most embarrassing times. Nerd. Milquetoast. Klutz. These are just three of the many undesirable words that can be used to describe Professor Julius Kelp. But all that changes when the chemistry expert invents a potion that transforms him into a suave, sexy chick magnet, whom Julius aptly names Buddy Love. Unfortunately, there's one side effect: Buddy can't control when he'll change back into Julius, an event that always happens at inopportune times. How will Julius/Buddy resolve his Jekyll-and-Hyde dilemma?—alfiehitchie Julius Kelp is a nerdy and not very handsome chemistry professor at small college. The mild mannered Kelp has been bullied all of his life and is now pushed around by his students, especially the football players. One of his students, the pretty Stella Purdy, encourages him to stand up to them but his approach is to develop a chemical solution that will turn him into a different man. What he develops turns him into Buddy Love, who Stella aptly describes as a rude and discourteous egomaniac. One thing he can't control however is when he turns back into Kelp, something that puts his secret in danger of becoming public.—garykmcd Jerry Lewisdirected, co-wrote and starred in this riotously funny movie that set a new standard for screen comedy and inspired the hit remake. Lewis plays a timid, nearsighted chemistry teacher who discovers a magical potion that can transform him into a suave and handsome Romeo. The Jekyll and Hyde game works well enough until the concoction starts to wear off at the most embarrassing times, and the professor begins to suffer hilarious symptoms of his personality split. Co-starringStella Stevens. Passionate about chemistry, the unpopular, lily-livered university professor Dr Julius Kelp has always been an easy target for bullies. But enough is enough. As a result, fed up with being a weakling all his life, Julius decides to put his extensive knowledge to good use and formulate the perfect chemical concoction to impress beautiful, compassionate Stella Purdy. However, there's a catch. As maladroit Dr Kelp wins back his lost dignity one sip at a time, unforeseen side effects threaten his newfound bliss. And, as if that weren't enough, a conceited, self-assured Casanova has set his sights on stealing the girl of his dreams. Can the nutty professor change charming Stella's mind?—Nick Riganas Professor Julius Kelp is a nerdy, scruffy, buck-toothed, accident-prone, socially awkward university professor whose experiments in the classroom laboratory are unsuccessful and highly destructive. When a football-playing bully embarrasses and attacks him, Kelp decides to ""beef up"" by joining a local gym. Kelp's lack of physical strength leads him to seek a solution in his specialty of chemistry. He invents a serum that turns him into Buddy Love: a handsome, suave, charming and brash girl-chasing hipster.This new personality gives him the self-confidence to pursue one of his students, Stella Purdy. Although she resents Love, she finds herself strangely attracted to him. Buddy wows the crowd with his jazzy, breezy musical delivery and poised demeanor at the Purple Pit, a nightclub where the students hang out. He also mocks a bartender and waitress and punches a student. The formula wears off at inopportune times, often to Kelp's humiliation.Although Kelp knows that his alternate persona is a bad person, he cannot prevent himself from continually taking the formula as he enjoys the attention that Love receives. As Buddy performs at the annual student dance the formula starts to wear off. His real identity now revealed, Kelp gives an impassioned speech, admitting his mistakes and seeking forgiveness. Kelp says that the one thing he learned from being someone else is that if you don't like yourself, you can't expect others to like you. Purdy meets Kelp backstage, and confesses that she prefers Kelp over Buddy Love.Eventually, Kelp's formerly timid father chooses to market the formula (a copy of which Kelp had sent to his parents' home for safekeeping), endorsed by the deadpan president of the university who proclaims, ""It's a gasser!"" Kelp's father makes a pitch to the chemistry class, and the students all rush forward to buy the new tonic. In the confusion Kelp and Purdy slip out of the class. Armed with a marriage license and two bottles of the formula, they elope.During the short closing credits, each of the characters comes out and bows down to the camera, and when Jerry Lewis, still portraying Kelp, comes out and bows, he trips and goes into the camera, breaking it and causing the picture to go black."

El Kerim insists that the Princess marry him, but she refuses, and so is slated for execution. Sindbad and his men traverse the swamps of horror in order to reach the tower of the evil heart. They encounter carnivorous vines, giant prehistoric monsters, volcanic lava pits and whirlpools on the way, finally battling an ogre with the multiple heads of a dragon. Outtakes of this ""Dragon-Ogre"" where used briefly in the movie ""Natural Born Killers"". When they reach the tower, Sindbad, with the aid of a hook, begins to climb the immense rope to the top of the tower. Sindbad reaches the top of the tower, and finds El-Carim's beating heart encased in crystal. The heart is protected by a giant hand, which chases Sindbad all around the bell tower. Sindbad throws the hook at the crystal, which dislodges the evil heart, giving El Kerim a heart attack. Sindbad then manages to vanquish the monster hand. Seeking to protect the heart, El Kerim flies in a winged chariot towards the tower, accompanied by Galgo. Sindbad is about to impale the evil heart when El-Carim arrives on the scene. The two have a fierce swordfight while Galgo steals the wretched heart, and tosses it over the side of the tower. As it falls to the ground, El Kerim faints, and falls to his death. The entire kingdom then has a celebration for the marriage of the Princess and Captain Sindbad."

Jason has been prophesied to take the throne of Thessaly. When he saves Pelias from drowning, but does not recognize him as the man who had earlier killed his father, Pelias tells Jason to travel to Colchis to find the Golden Fleece. Jason follows his advice and assembles a sailing crew of the finest men in Greece, including Hercules. They are under the protection of Hera, queen of the gods. Their voyage is replete with battles against harpies, a giant bronze Talos, a hydra, and an animated skeleton army, all brought to life by the special effects wizardry of Ray Harryhausen.—Rick Gregory <rag.apa@email.apa.org> After a 20 year voyage, Jason (Armstrong) returns to the Kingdom of Thessaly to claim his throne. But it's not quite easy for this. In order to gain the throne, he must find the magical Golden Fleece, which has amazing healing powers. He selects a crew, which included Polydeuces (Crawford) and Hercules (Green). Jason also gains the help of the Queen of the Gods, Hera (Blackman). Jason and his crew must now reach the fleece and survive the likes of a 100 foot bronze giant, a huge venomous creature with head full of seven snakes, and a terrifying army of skeletons.—Film_Fan An infant Jason is taken away far off safely after his family is killed and his father's throne taken by his uncle Pelias. Jason returns aft 20 years to claim his rightful throne. He saves Pelias from drowning unknown to him that he is the killer of his family and usurper of his throne. But Pelias recognizes him and cunningly encourages Jason to sail off to the end of the world to seek the legendary golden fleece n later reclaim the kingdom and face Pelias. Pelias gets relieved thinking that Jason wont be able to return safely. Jason is offered help by Zeus but he declines and sets out to build a ship and recruit the best men from all over Greece and among them is Hercules which boosts the morale of the crew.—Fella_shibby@yahoo.com Pelias (Douglas Wilmer) usurps the throne of Thessaly by killing King Aristo. However, there is a prophecy that he will be overthrown by a child of Aristo wearing one sandal. When he kills one of Aristo's daughters after she had sought and been granted the protection of Hera, Pelias makes an enemy of the goddess.Twenty years later, Jason (Todd Armstrong), Aristo's son grown to manhood, saves the life of Pelias during a chance encounter, but loses a sandal doing so. He does not know that he has rescued his father's murderer, but Pelias recognizes his nemesis. Pelias keeps his identity secret. However, he cannot just kill Jason; the prophecy also says that he himself would die.When he learns that Jason is undertaking a dangerous quest to obtain the fabled Golden Fleece to rally the people of Thessaly, Pelias encourages him, hoping that he will be killed in the attempt. Men from all over Greece compete for the honor of joining Jason. Since their ship is named the Argo after the ship's builder Argos (Laurence Naismith), they are dubbed the Argonauts. Among those chosen are Hercules (Nigel Green) and Acastus (Gary Raymond), the son of Pelias, who is sent by his father to sabotage the voyage.Jason is taken to Mount Olympus by Hermes (Michael Gwynn) to speak to the gods Zeus (Niall MacGinnis) and Hera (Honor Blackman). Hera tells him that she wishes him well, but that Zeus has imposed restrictions on her assistance (Jason, like all mortals, is a piece in the game which the gods play against each other. This is an accurate portrayal of Greek theology and rarely found in any modern medium). Jason is told that he can only invoke Hera's aid five times (the same number of times his sister called on the goddess by name for help before she was slain). In response to Jason's unasked questions, Hera tells him to search for the Fleece in the land of Colchis, on the other side of the world.Many dangers threaten the expedition. When the Argonauts run perilously low on supplies, Jason turns to Hera. She guides him to the Isle of Bronze, but warns him to take nothing but provisions. However, while chasing some goats, Hercules and his young friend Hylas (John Cairney) find a partially-open treasure chamber of the gods, surmounted by an enormous bronze statue of Talos. Despite Hylas' warning, Hercules steals an enormous brooch pin the size of a javelin. The statue comes to life and attacks, causing much mayhem before Jason can destroy it using Hera's advice. Hylas goes missing and is presumed dead, but the guilt-ridden Hercules refuses to leave until he knows for certain. The other Argonauts will not abandon Hercules, so Jason is forced to call on Hera for the last time. She confirms that Hylas is indeed dead and that Hercules is destined not to continue with them.Hera also directs them to seek out Phineas (Patrick Troughton), the blind seer, for the way to Colchis. They find him tormented by two blue-skinned, bat-like Harpies sent by Zeus to punish him for misusing his gift of prophecy. In return for imprisoning the flying creatures, Phineas tells Jason what he needs to know and gives Jason his only possession, an amulet. To reach Colchis however, they must pass between the Clashing Rocks, a strait flanked by towering rock cliffs that shake and drop boulders to sink any ships attempting to pass between them. Fortunately for the Argonauts, they learn this second hand. Another ship tries to run the strait from the other direction and founders. In despair, Jason throws Phineas' gift into the water; the god Triton emerges and holds back the rocks long enough to let the Argo pass through. On the other side, they pick up three survivors of the other ship, including Medea (Nancy Kovack), the high priestess of the goddess Hecate.They sight Colchis the next day. Acastus and Jason disagree on how to approach the King of Colchis. The argument escalates into a swordfight. Eventually Acastus is disarmed and jumps into the sea to escape. Believing him dead, Jason and his men accept an invitation from King Aeëtes (Jack Gwillim) to a feast, but once they are off guard, they are captured and imprisoned. Acastus has betrayed them, telling Aeëtes about their mission. However, Medea helps Jason and his men escape.Acastus tries to steal the Fleece himself, but is fatally wounded by its guardian, the many-headed Hydra. Jason succeeds in killing the monster and taking the Fleece. But Aeëtes is not far behind. He strews the teeth of the Hydra on the ground and prays to Hecate. The planted teeth sprout out of the ground as armed skeletons who pursue and battle Jason and two of his men (in a famous four minute stop motion sequence that took special effects wizard Ray Harryhausen four and a half months to produce[1]). Seeing that his companions have been slain, Jason escapes by jumping off a cliff into the sea.The quest fulfilled, he, Medea and the surviving Argonauts start the return voyage to Thessaly."

Now Dr. John Markway has assembled a team of people who he thinks will prove whether or not the house is haunted. Dr. Markway, doing research to prove the existence of ghosts, investigates Hill House, a large, eerie mansion with a lurid history of violent death and insanity. With him are the skeptical young Luke, who stands to inherit the house, the mysterious and clairvoyant Theodora and the insecure Eleanor, whose psychic abilities make her feel somehow attuned to whatever spirits inhabit the old mansion. As time goes by it becomes obvious that they have gotten more than they bargained for as the ghostly presence in the house manifests itself in horrific and deadly ways.—Doug Sederberg <vornoff@sonic.net> Located in a remote part of New England and isolated from any nearby community, Hill House is a 90-year-old, 19th century mansion with a long history of death and murder. When Dr. John Markway gets a chance to stay there for a few weeks, he sees an opportunity to study what is reportedly a genuine haunted house. With several others including Luke Sannerson, Eleanor 'Nell' Lance and a one-named woman named Theodora, they prepare to launch their experiments. Theo is there because of her ESP skills while Nell had a previous experience with a poltergeist and Luke represents the family that still owns Hill House. Soon after their arrival, the temporary occupants begin to face terrifying ordeals. Nell, who has lived a sheltered and repressed life having spent all of her time caring for her recently deceased mother, is clearly the focus of the emanations and the haunting. She is both terrified and comforted in Hill House and part of her wants to stay. The spirits seem to want to keep her as well.—garykmcd Ninety years ago, Hugh Crain built the mansion Hill House in a remote area of New England. When his wife is moving to the mansion, she has an accident and dies, leaving the bitter Hugh Crain and his daughter Abigail alone in Hill House.

When she is an old and invalid woman, she hires a paid companion from the village, but the woman neglects her and she dies. The companion inherits Hill House but the mansion drives her crazy and she commits suicide. In the present days (1963), Dr. John Markway rents the mansion from the inheritor Mrs. Sannerson to study the supernatural and prove the existence of ghosts. He invites the clairvoyant Theodora 'Theo' and the unbalanced and needy psychic Eleanor 'Nell' Lance to spend vacation in Hill House, and he goes with the skeptical future inheritor Luke Sannerson to the mansion. During the nights, the quartet witness supernatural manifestation in the house and the sanity of Nell is affected by her ghosts.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Anthropologist Dr. John Markway is interested in the study of the supernatural, much to the chagrin of his wife, Grace Markway. He is able to convince Mrs. Sannerson, the current owner of isolated Hill House, to let him bring a research team into the house to search for supernatural phenomena. In its ninety year history, Hill House, located in remote New England, has been the location of many a violent and mysterious death of its inhabitants, Mrs. Sannerson being a distant relative of Abigail Crain's companion who inherited Hill House upon old Abigail Crain's death. The house has been handed down to the current owner, Mrs. Sannerson. She doesn't live at the house believing it to be haunted, but has one stipulation: that her Midwestern nephew Luke Sannerson, the spoiled and immature supposed heir of the house, be part of that research team. The other two members of the team, who Dr. Markway has not yet met but hired solely based one issue he knows about each, are surname-less Theodora - ""Theo"" - and Eleanor Lance - ""Nell"" - the former a somewhat glib psychic, the latter who grew up with some supernatural phenomena which she would rather forget. Eleanor is a meek and nervous woman who has felt trapped in most of her adult life, having to take care of her invalid mother until her passing two months ago about which she feels some guilt in its occurrence. Currently living with her married sister, Eleanor sees this research as a vacation, realistically an escape from her current sad life. As the research progresses, the four members truly begin to believe that there is something supernatural about their environment. But Eleanor begins to feel connected to the house, and what is happening in it... or is she just justifying it as a better replacement for her current life?—Huggo The film opens with narration over a silhouette of Hill House at night. The narrator, Dr. John Markway (Richard Johnson) tells us, ""An evil old house, the kind some people call haunted is like an undiscovered country waiting to be explored. Hill House had stood for 90 years and might stand for 90 more. Silence lay steadily against the wood and stone of Hill House. Whatever walked there walked alone."" Title and credits follow, then narration continues, ""Scandal, murder, insanity, suicide: The history of Hill House was ideal. It had everything I wanted..."" The house was built in New England by a man named Hugh Crain for his wife and young daughter. A horse and carriage accident took the life of the first Mrs. Crain (an uncredited Pamela Buckley) before she even saw the house. Hugh Crain (an uncredited Howard Lang) and young daughter, Abigail (an uncredited Janet Mansell) said a few words over the body, but Hugh was left an embittered man. Crain married again, and the second Mrs. Crain (an uncredited Freda Knorr) also died, falling down the main staircase. Hugh Crain left Abigail with a nurse (an uncredited Susan Richards) and went to England where he died in a drowning accident. Abigail kept the same nursery room her entire life. By the time she was eighty (an uncredited Amy Dalby) she was a bedridden invalid. Her nurse-companion (an uncredited Rosemary Dorken) was a local girl and, it is with this young companion the evil reputation of Hill House really begins. The old lady died while calling for help. The companion was trysting on the verandah with a farm hand. The companion inherited Hill House and occupied it for many years, but eventually hanged herself. The house then passed to a distant relative, named Mrs. Sannerson (Fay Compton).Markway visits Mrs. Sannerson where he convinces her to let him use the house for psychic research. He explains, ""I shall occupy the house with a group of carefully selected assistants...I must have specially qualified help to take notes and document any evidence of the supernatural I may find."" Eldridge Harper (Ronald Adam), Mrs. Sannerson's lawyer, voices his concern about publicity seekers and the propriety of having women in the house. Harper suggests to Mrs. Sannerson that her nephew, Luke, joins the doctor at Hill House, as he expects to inherit the property. Mrs. Sannerson asks point blank, ""Exactly what do you and your assistants expect to find at Hill House?"" Markway replies, ""Maybe only a few loose floorboards, and maybe, I only say maybe, the key to another world.""Dr. Markway, taking a leave of absence from his university professorship, finalizes his list of assistants. Only two end up accepting, Eleanor Lance and Theodora (no last name).Eleanor Lance (Julie Harris) is living with her sister. She is nearly broke and weary after looking after her invalid mother non-stop for eleven years. Mother is now dead, and she fights with her sister over just about everything. She begs to use the car, which is after all, half hers. Her brother-in-law, Bud Fredericks (an uncredited Paul Maxwell) tries to act as mediator between Eleanor and his wife, Carrie (Diane Clare). He is sympathetic to Eleanor's plight, but their daughter, Dora (an uncredited Verina Greenlaw) takes her cues from her mother, and taunts her Aunt Eleanor. On the vacation plan, Bud sides with Eleanor, ""I think you should have a vacation, Nell."" Carrie objects, but Eleanor is not to be deterred and she shows her family how she reacts when pushed to her breaking point. She is normally quiet and meek, but when pushed is loud and assertive.Nell decides to take the car and confronts the garage attendant (an uncredited Claude Jones) for the keys. She departs Boston along U.S. 50 and Route 238 to Hill House. We hear Nell thinking and she reveals she will never return to live with her sister. In fact, most of what we learn of Eleanor is hearing her thoughts.Eleanor arrives at Hill House. The property is surrounded by a stone wall and the entrance by a tall, iron spiked, gate. She honks the car horn, and Mr. Dudley (Valentine Dyall), the cranky caretaker, finally deigns to respond. ""What do you want?"" he asks. Eleanor explains that she is expected. After an impertinent exchange with Eleanor, Dudley finally opens the gate and allows her to enter the property. Eleanor is the first to arrive and drives up to the house. Along the way she stops to look at it. It is a huge, stone mansion with lots of detail on the façade and steep, pitched roofs. Her first reaction is that the house is vile and it is staring at her. She carries her suitcase to the front door and is greeted by Mrs. Dudley (Rosalie Crutchley). Mrs. Dudley reluctantly allows Eleanor to come inside, but does not utter a word to her.The inside of the house is dark and over-decorated, and Eleanor is escorted to her room. Mrs. Dudley explains the house rules about meals, and that she won't stay in the house after dark. Eleanor checks out the bathroom and hears the next guest arrive. Theodora (Claire Bloom) introduces herself. Eleanor explains they share a bathroom. Mrs. Dudley repeats her meal and departure rules by rote, but Theo and Nell ignore her. Theodora is a bit strange to Eleanor (Theo clearly flirts with Eleanor throughout the film) Theodora's sexual orientation is only hinted at, and we later learn she has the gift of ESP. Theo and Nell explore the house, but they get lost. Both women feel a chill, and Nell observes, ""The house, it's alive."" Theo seems to feel that the house wants Nell.Dr. Markway appears and explains he left the door opened, but it closed itself. Markway gives the women a tour of part of the house, starting with the main purple parlor, which they will use as an operations center. He explains that all the doors were set slightly off-center, so they close themselves. Despite studying plans to the house, even Markway gets lost on his way to the dining room. They hear a noise, but it turns out to be Luke Sannerson (Russ Tamblyn) mixing a pitcher of martinis as he enters the dining room. Luke serves each person a martini. They sit down for dinner and discuss their duties and responsibilities. Markway explains that Theo was accepted because of her remarkable power of ESP and Eleanor had a poltergeist experience as a child, ""showers of stone fell on your house for three days when you were 10 years old."" Luke is a non-believer. His interest is to financially exploit Hill House, after he inherits it, of course.That evening, in the parlor, Markway works on his notes while Eleanor sits quietly on the couch. Theo and Luke play gin rummy at the game table. Theo's ability to see cards allows her to win five games in a row, much to Luke annoyance. She demands he pay her the $12 he owes, but he refuses because she cheated. The four decide to turn in for the night and continue the tour the next morning. Markway gives them papers and asks that they complete them with their observations each night.Sometime during the night, Eleanor wakes, and still in a near dream state, thinks she hears her mother knocking on the wall. Theo hears it from the next room also and calls to Nell. The two women are frightened and both hear the pounding noise. It comes and goes, but louder each time. They finally hear a woman shrieking and laughing that fades away. When Nell opens the door she sees Luke and Markway in the hall outside. The men explain they were chasing a dog and followed it outside, but they did not hear the loud noises the women heard. Markway concludes that something is trying to separate the men and women.The next morning, Markway and Nell join for breakfast. Nell is starting to develop romantic feelings for John Markway, unaware that he is married. She tells him that she spent eleven years taking care of her invalid mother. Nell also voices her fear that she will be turned out of Hill House with no where to go. Markway tells Nell how he came to do psychic research, and that his family disapproves. Theo joins the pair and warns the doctor, ""If anyone gets hurt, it's going to be your fault, Markway."" Markway explains that no one has ever been physically hurt by a ghost. Luke enters and directs his companions to something he saw in the hall. Someone or something has handwritten a message in chalk on the wall. It says, ""Help Eleanor Come Home."" Eleanor reacts strongly. She first accuses Theo of playing a cruel joke. The two women bicker and Markway postpones the tour and tells Theo to take Eleanor to her room.The tour starts with the greenhouse. A large stone sculpture sits in the center of the room. It is supposed to be St. Francis curing the lepers, but Luke thinks its a family portrait of Hugh Crain and his wives and daughter. Suddenly, the door slams open and a gust of wind moves the plants. They approach the library, but Nell refuses to enter. The smell reminds her of her mother's sick room. Prominent in the room is a very tall, wrought iron, spiral staircase. Markway points out that the balcony high above is where the companion to Abigail Crain hanged herself. Luke climbs up a few feet on the staircase, but jumps back to the ground when it starts to sway and shake.Eleanor ventures out to the verandah and nearly falls over the balcony as she looks up to the tower above the library. Markway threatens to send her home, but Nell begs to stay. Markway suggests Theo and Nell share a bedroom... ""like sisters"". That evening, the two women discuss their lives and plans for the future. Nell makes up a story about having an apartment of her own. Just when Theo is about to make a move onto Nell, Markway calls them and Luke into the hallway outside the Nursery. He has discovered a cold spot. He invites all to experience the phenomenon. He gleefully explains, ""A cold spot, a genuine cold spot. I guarantee it won't register on any thermometer."" Luke dismisses it as just a draft, but Markway says it is the heart of Hill House: The Nursery.In the middle of the night, Nell awakens. She hears a little girl laughing. She asks Theo to hold her hand, as their two beds are almost touching. The laughter continues and Nell complains, ""Theo, you're breaking my hand."" The laughs turn to wimpering and Nell complains that something is hurting a child and she won't allow that to happen. She yells, ""Stop It!"" Theo turns on the light and we see Nell is on a day bed about twenty feet from the bed Theo occupies. Nell stares at her hand and asks, ""Whose hand was I holding?""The next morning, Markway is in the music room and checks his watch and makes a note about the harp playing itself. Nell enters the room and asks about how it could play itself. Markway explains that it may be preternatural: Something we don't have any natural explanation for right now, but probably will have some day. Nell voices her fear that it is all in her imagination and concludes she may be going insane. She is haunted by the circumstances of her mother's death and that she may somehow be responsible. They both hear the harp play a note and Markway again checks his watch and makes a note in his paperwork.That evening, Luke finds a disturbing book that Hugh Crain made for his daughter, Abigail. Nell and Theo bicker and Markway notes that everyone's nerves are on edge. Theo continues to flirt as well as needle Nell, this time about a budding romance she fantasizes about with John Markway. Nell runs away and Theo catches up to her, and tells Nell that is he is making a fool of herself in thinking that Dr. Markway will ever get involved with her. Nell accuses Theo of being an ""unnatural thing"" as well as a ""nature's mistake.""At that moment, a car horn honks and a taxi pulls up in front of the house. Grace Markway (Lois Maxwell), John's wife, arrives. She informs her husband, ""A reporter's been telephoning all day. He's on your track. He's heard about you renting this place."" Grace begs her husband to abandon the house and his research. When John refuses, Grace pays the driver, grabs her suitcase and announces she is staying at Hill House, ""to join the ghost hunt."" When Eleanor casually mentions the nursery as a place to stay, Grace quickly accepts the challenge, ""Thank you, my dear. The nursery it is."" Markway and Nell try to dissuade her, but Grace responds, ""You insult my intelligence. You don't think I'd believe anything you ghost hunters might tell me."" Luke notices the door to the nursery is open for the first time. Grace decides to spend the night in the room, despite everyone's warning not to. Markway insists he and the three researchers spend the night downstairs in the parlor.Later that night, Nell and Theo sleep together on the sofa by the fireplace as Markway sleeps in a chair. Luke finishes his tour upstairs and enters the parlor. He heads for a bottle on the mantle. Suddenly, the parlor door slams shut by itself and the others wake with a start. They hear a deep rhythmic banging outside the door. Markway is concerned about his wife upstairs. Next a very loud banging comes from just outside the door. The unseen phantom presses against the parlor door as it bows inward and out like breathing, creaking and crunching against the hinges. The sound moves to overhead towards the nursery. Markway is desperate to check on his wife.Unseen, Nell runs from the parlor, through the music room, and upstairs directly to the nursery room. The doors are open, but Grace Markway is nowhere to be seen. Her bed shows signs of being used. Markway and the others arrive and start the search. Nell wanders away. She finds herself in the greenhouse. Descending into her own little world, Nell dances out onto the verandah. When she hears the others calling to her, Nell runs into the Library. She is drawn to the spiral staircase and the balcony at the top. Before she reaches the top, the rickety staircase begins its swaying, the lateral support bolts pulling away from the wall. Markway calls to her, begging her to carefully walk back down. She ignores him and stands on the balcony. Markway carefully climbs the stairs and joins Nell on the iron balcony platform. Before they walk back down, Nell sees Grace Markway peer at her through a trap door in the ceiling.A little later, Markway is furious and now insists Eleanor leave the house for her own safety. Luke brings her car around and Theo packs her bag. Nell tries to talk them out of her dismissal, but the three insist she leave. They escort Eleanor out to her car. Luke gets back out of Nell's car to retrieve the gate key from Markway. She drives off without Luke. Before she reaches the gate she is distracted by the white-robed figure of Grace Markway and crashes into a tree.The three find Eleanor dead in the half overturned car. She crashed into the same tree that killed the first Mrs. Crain. Grace wanders over to the accident scene. She explains to her husband, ""I didn't want any of this to happen. You must believe me, John."" She explains that she woke and was frightened. She got lost looking for her husband and ended up in the attic. While Theo blames Grace for Eleanor's accident, Luke takes a different view. ""Eleanor did it to herself. It looked to me, anyway, like she deliberately aimed the car at this tree."" Markway blames the house. Luke stares at the house and remarks, ""It ought to be burned down and the ground sowed with salt.""We close with an evening shot of Hill House with Eleanor, now a ghost, narrating from beyond the grave about Hill House and that ""we who walk here... walk alone."" The end title comes up as well as the final title card 'The Haunting' followed by eerie piano music."
The Haunted Palace,1963,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0057128/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Charles Dexter Ward arrives at a small village to visit the house he inherited from his ancestor who died there 100 years ago. Loosely based on an HP Lovecraft novel , this tale begins with a warlock placing a curse on a group of villagers about to burn him at the stake. Generations later, the warlock's descendant returns to the village to pick up where his ancestor left off.—Humberto Amador Charles Ward travels to inspect the mansion he's inherited. It was once owned by his great grandfather, a disciple of the devil, who cursed the locals as they burned him. Everyone's suspicious of Ward, blaming the curse for the horrors which have befallen the village. Ward's arrival allows Curwen to take over his body and continue his evil ways by avenging himself.—Jeremy Perkins {J-26} In this chilling adaptation of H.P. Lovecrafts The Case Of Charles Dexter Ward, Charles Dexter Ward (Vincent Price) travels with his wife Ann (Debra Paget) to Arkham to inspect a mansion he has inherited. The original lord of the manor was his Great Grandfather Joseph Curwen, a disciple of the devil, who placed a hideous curse on the villagers as they burned him at the stake. Slowly Ward feels the spirit of his ancestor possessing him and seeking a desperate vengeance on the descendants of those who previously thwarted his plans. Accursed mutants...evil possession...will anyone escape The Haunted Palace?In the town of Arkham, in 18th century New England, Ezra Weeden (Leo Gordon) and Micah Smith (Elisha Cook Jr.) follow a young woman named Fitch at a distance. She seems to be in a trance as she walks through a cemetery to a palace door where she knocks and is ushered in by a woman named Hester. Declaring this is the home of Satan himself, Ezra and Micah go to get help. Meanwhile, Hester takes the Fitch woman to Joseph Curwan (Vincent Price), who leads her through a secret door downstairs to a platform in an ancient dungeon cellar. He chains her between two posts on the platform and then he chants in Latin. The woman finally awakes screaming at the sound of some beast growling from below.The townspeople armed with torches arrive at the palace door and knock. Curwan opens it and produces the Fitch girl alive and well, but still in a trance. She answers yes to his claims that she came of her own free will, but when asked by Weeden for her name she cannot answer. The townspeople accuse Curwan of being a warlock and tie him to a tree. He calls out their names: Ezra Weeden, Micah Smith, Benjamin West, Priam Willet (Frank Maxwell), and Gideon Leach. He declares that he will rise from the dead and that this town and they and their families will bear his curse. Then he is set on fire and burned to death.110 years later, a man who looks identical to Curwan, his great-great-grandson Charles Dexter Ward, arrives in Arkham with his wife Ann (Debra Paget), looking for the palace that he has inherited. They are warned that the village is cursed to which Charles scoffs. They enter a tavern called the Burning Man Tavern and tell the people theyre looking for the Curwen family house. Edgar Weeden (a dead ringer for his own ancestor, as are all the other main characters) warns them it is a palace of unknown origin brought stone by stone from some European country. Mr. Willet, a doctor, gives them directions there and shows them where the palace is on the side of a cliff. After they leave, Edgar warns the townspeople that Joseph Curwan has come back to Arkham.The Wards enter the palace and note that the portrait of Joseph Curwan looks just like Charles. Charles seems momentarily possessed by it. As they explore other rooms in the house, a caretaker named Simon (Lon Chaney Jr.) greets them. The attorney had contacted him and he was preparing it for their arrival. Not wishing to stay in a town with such unfriendly people, they tell him they plan to leave at once. But he encourages them to at least spend the night, since there is no place else to go.In his home, Edgar feeds some creature that is behind his locked and barred attic door. It grabs his hand through the bars and Edgar has to use a candle to chase it off. He tells his wife that ""it"" knows Curwan has come back to Arkham. At the palace, the more Ward looks at the painting, the more it seems to possess him. The next morning, Charles tells his wife that he is now planning to stay, just for a few weeks to get the place ready to be sold. She doesn't like it, but agrees to remain.As Charles and Ann walk through town early on a foggy morning, they find the tavern door locked. Then a series of mutated people - a young girl with no eyes, and four other similarly blind, half-blind or otherwise deformed men slowly approach the Wards menacingly until they are surrounded. But the sound of a bell tolling in the distance causes them to disperse and walk away. Later, Dr. Willet tells them all those people were born mutated. Weeden had gathered them together to try and chase the newcomers away.He tells the story of Joseph Curwan, who came to town 150 years ago. His first wife died in childbirth so he took the most beautiful woman in town, Hester, as his mistress a woman who had been promised to Ezra Weeden. Over the years, terrible noises were heard from the castle, and young girls often disappeared at night then were returned with no memory. They concluded he was a warlock a conjurer of the dead. He was thought to have found a legendary book, the Necronomicon, which gave him formulas to summon dark gods from beyond, who had once ruled the world, and now were waiting to take it back again. He was trying to mate the gods with humans to create a new race through which the gods could gain control. The townspeople feel that the mutations were failed experiments. Willet himself can't explain the mutations and advises them to flee the village as if a madman with a knife was chasing them.That night, Charles hears the sound of voices outside but there is no one there. He goes outside to look and Simon finds him and suggests he ""ask Mr. Curwan."" He takes him to the portrait room. After Ward has stared at the portrait for a time, Simon addresses him as Joseph. Ward begins to speak in a different sinister tone of voice. Curwan is now possessing Ward's body, but he tells Simon he feels Ward is still fighting him and he will lose possession of him shortly. He tells Simon and another old friend Jabez to keep Ward there so that he can soon possess him completely. They present him with the Necronomicon. Ann comes downstairs hearing them talk, but when she arrives they are all gone except Ward, who is back to his normal self for now.A week passes, and Ward is still there. The townspeople discuss putting a stop to him. Meanwhile, late one night, he digs up the grave of Hester Tellinghast and he and his crew bring the body into his palace down to the secret cellar. When Ann asks where hes been, he cruelly scolds her and sends her back to her room alone. Joseph's voice calls to him declaring he will never leave him alone and that his will is too strong to fight. When Ann comes back to confront him, he tells her she must leave tomorrow. Ann goes downstairs later looking for Charles but finds Simon instead and faints. Meanwhile, Joseph is chanting in Latin for Hester to return to life, which she finally does, but she is too weak to stay alive. Joseph weakens from the effort and is taken back upstairs where Charles has no memory of what happened. He fears he is going mad, and tells Ann they must both leave in the morning.The next morning they try to leave quickly, but Simon says he must make out a receipt for the week's expenses first. Ann goes ahead to the cab, but Charles stays and falls under Joseph's spell again. Dr. Willet tells Ann about the grave robbery, and says Charles may have done it. Charles emerges from the house, acting like Joseph and blaming the others for trying to frame him and scare him away. He declares he has decided to stay. Ann tells Willet how her husband changes personalities more and more since the first night he arrived. Inside, Joseph declares that Charles is dead and he now has full control. But before he does his work, he must get his revenge against the descendants of the ones who burned him alive.At the bar, Weeden talks about the grave robbery and tries to stir the townspeople into fighting back against Ward, saying if they do nothing to save themselves they deserve whatever they get. Meanwhile, the possessed Ward unbolts the door to Weeden's locked attic, releasing the creature. Weeden returns home to be attacked by the thing, and both die when they fall into the fireplace. Ward tears the name Ezra Weeden off his revenge list. Peter Smith is appalled when Ward later attends Weeden's funeral from a distance.Night falls, and while Peter Smith is out walking alone, Ward tosses gasoline on him and sets him on fire. Micah Smith's name is removed from the list. Simon warns him to stop feasting on revenge, but Curwan insists on continuing his task. He goes to make love to Ann, but she scratches him and makes him leave. She then summons Dr. Willet for help, telling him Joseph Curwan is killing her husband. Ward arrives suddenly in mid-conversation and tells the doctor the house is affecting his wife. He pretends he is unchanged, asking the doctor to take her to Boston. She reluctantly agrees, and leaves at once with the doctor. As they pass through the town, the townspeople show Willet and Ann the burned body of Smith and declare that her husband killed him. Willet decides they must get Ward out of the palace before the townspeople kill him.Alone with Simon and Jabez, Charles succeeds in bringing Hester completely back from the dead. Ann and Willet go back to the palace but can't find Ward. Willet remembers how Ward just appeared when they were talking by the picture. They look at the nearby wall and find the secret door to the cellar. In the cellar, they find the empty coffin of Hester and the Necronomicon. Charles, Simon, Hester and Jabez confront them. Joseph tells of a project - the most important ever attempted by humans - that they were working on ""a few years ago"". They don't fully understand it, they just obey. Simon takes Willet away while Ann is chained to the posts. Ward chants in Latin. Jabez tell Willet they are ""honoring"" her. The grate below the posts is opened, and an unearthly creature begins to rise from the depths below.The townspeople charge to the palace and open the door calling for Joseph Curwan and setting the place on fire. They toss the portrait of Curwan in the fire. When they do, Ward is freed of Joseph's possession. He runs to his wife and unchains her before the creature arrives. Simeon and Jabez attack him, calling him a traitor. He pleads for Willet to take Ann to safety. The doctor gets her outside safely and then goes back for Charles. He finds him alone and collapsed in the cellar, and barely manages to get him out the front door before the flames consume the palace. Leaning against a tree, Ward tells them he is all right now, thanks to Ann and Dr. Willet and that he looks forward to repaying their kindness. But the sinister tone of his voice and the half smile on his face as he turns back around indicate that he is once again possessed by Joseph."

Sentemental military comedy revolves around two contemporary army buddies, Master Sergeant Maxwell Slaughter (Jackie Gleason), a smooth operator, who supply Sergeant Eustis Clay (Steve McQueen) idolizes and hopes will join him as a civilian in a private business enterprise. Clay endeavors to be a player in the military, just like Slaughter, but it seems as though Clay still has a lot to learn from his mentor. They are joined by Tuesday Weld as a shrill dizzy blonde teenager named Bobby Jo Pepperdine and Tony Bill as bumbling Private First Class Jerry Meltzer, McQueen's screwball sidekick.—alfiehitchie Eustis Clay is a Supply Sergeant at a US Army base in the American south. Eustis is looking to his future when he will soon be decommissioned, as a civilian when he plans to make his proverbial millions as he comes up with one hair brained scheme after another, some of those schemes for the seed money needed to start that money making business. With any of those current schemes, Eustis will often employ the more than willing assistance of somewhat naive Pvt. Jerry Meltzer. The one thing Eustis has determined is the company name: Maxwell Slaughter/Eustis Clay Inc. Overweight and in middle age, Master Sergeant Maxwell Slaughter is the person to who Eustis looks up to the most, and as such Eustis is trying to convince him to join him in the world outside the military. Wiser than Eustis, Maxwell humors him in truly enjoying their friendship which entails each having the other's back in almost every situation, in knowing that Eustis' schemes have no chance of success, and in being a career military man meaning he has no intention of joining Eustis in business, even if the schemes were viable. To help convince Maxwell sooner than later seeing to his own imminent exit from the military, Eustis believes a girlfriend for Maxwell could help nudge him in that direction. Of the many women around the base that Eustis knows, who he chooses as that girlfriend for Maxwell is eighteen year old high school senior Bobby Jo Pepperdine, who, despite being a proverbial good girl, has had her fair share of military men boyfriends even older than Maxwell. Eustis' formal introduction of Maxwell to Bobby Jo has unintended consequences for them all, especially as two MPs, Sergeants James Priest and Fred Lenahan, have long had it out for Eustis.—Huggo M/Sgt. Maxwell Slaughter (Jackie Gleason) is a ""lifer"" NCO (""three-up, three-down"") at a typical Army base. He has a private office in Special Services, where a drink machine dispenses bottle-soda when struck in the right place. Sgt. Eustis Clay (Steve McQueen) (""three-up"") is a supply sergeant, whose specialty is providing preferred underwear (""drawers, cotton"") for those who offer him favors. Eustis' mentor and preferred company is Sgt. Slaughter. Eustis fantasizes about ideas that will make he and Maxwell millions. Maxwell's role is to listen quietly and enjoy Eustis retelling the same fantasies. Neither can wait to separate from the Army. Eustis states with his ideas and Maxwell's brains, they will become millionaires. The plot involves Eustis evading an MP (Ed Nelson) who suspects Eustis of rotating mattresses in various locations to avoid being accused of misappropriating govt. property. One evening, Eustis invites Maxwell on a blind date with a high-school coed (Tuesday Weld), young enough by many years to be Maxwell's daughter.Eustis also has a date, and the four of them patronize a nightclub, which goes somewhat o.k. Another day, the same four go on a foursome golf date. They enjoy it until a private (Tony Bill) Eustis knows runs across the fairway to tell him his dog is ill. Eustis runs off to take a phone call, where he is told his dog (""Donald"") is dead. Eustis is devastated and none of Maxwell's well-worn truisms comfort Eustis.That night, Eustis is sitting in a bar and mourning Donald. The MP who is pursuing Eustis over mattress issues is in the bar with another MP, and they are off-duty. They pick a fight with Eustis who defends himself well, but is outnumbered. When it seems Eustis is nearly done for, Maxwell appears and he is not in a good mood. He immediately involves himself in the fight with the two MPs and disposes of them both. Eustis recovers and goes to Maxwell, who now is not looking well. They talk and Eustis assures Maxwell that everything is o.k. Maxwell accepts Eustis' assurances with grace. The next day, Eustis goes to the hospital to visit Maxwell and finds him in bed and awake. They discuss their usual fantasies and make laughter. They assure one another that all is well and that Maxwell will return to work after a brief stay in the hospital. A few days pass and Eustis learns that Maxwell has died. Eustis is again devastated. Eustis had two actual friends in this world and they are both dead. Later, Eustis walks out of an office. A sign on the bldg. reads, ""RE-UP"". Eustis has extended his enlistment. Eustis meets the private he knows. Eustis and the private discuss the passing of Maxwell, that Eustis has ""re-upped"", and how his life has changed with the loss of Maxwell.Eustis walks over to Maxwell's office, which is being emptied of all furniture. He walks in, and absent-mindedly slaps the drink machine while passing by; the machine obediently responds by unloading a bottle of soda. Eustis, surprised at first, walks back to the machine, picks up the bottle, and opens the cap. He walks to a window facing the street, where movers are loading the final pieces of Maxwell's furniture. The movers close-up the van, climb in the cab and drive away. As they are about to leave, the viewer's perspective changes. From the outside of the building, we watch Eustis as he stares at the van. We see the reflection of the van in reverse on the window where Eustis is standing. As we see the reflection of the van pulling away from the curb, we observe Eustis. He stares out the window until the van disappears. Eustis, sitting in Maxwell's chair, rotates away from the window with the drink in his hand. We see Eustis' head and the arm holding his drink. Slowly, Eustis lifts his arm to take a swallow from the bottle, and we see his arm uplifted. Eustis then drops his arm on the chair."

Ann eventually decides, however, that Charles is a confirmed bachelor, and she concentrates on establishing her career. She makes the rounds of theatrical agencies without success; in desperation, she answers an advertisement for a photographer's model and meets Mark, a smooth-talking agent who devotes his energies to finding her jobs. Her poses become increasingly revealing, but she continues to be treated with respect. At first, Ann is asked to do simple candid photos where nudity is only implied, then cheesecake photos where her breasts and bottoms are covered by an object or her hands and then finally cat fight pictures where she and another girl in lingerie pretend to fight on the floor. Ann eventually starts enjoying her job finding all of this to be rather silly, but then things become more edgy when she's asked to do photos where she pretends to have sex, where sexual assault (both male on female and female on male) is implied and eventually bdsm photos where she's tied to an archway with her shirt removed and then pretend-whipped. This last session proves to be more real than intended when the man loses himself and actually grazes her exposed back a couple of times with the whip. However, things truly escalate when Mark eventually presents Ann with an invitation to a party given by the influential Lil Duncan, who is actually a procuress. After a round of strip poker, Lil's affair eagerly degenerates into an orgy (although no one actually gets naked), so Mark tries to have sex with Ann. Realizing what's happening, she pushes him away which makes him angry and he become rough with her, but she manages to escape just in time before the failed seduction can turn into an actual assault. Sally and Bob are married; Charles' novel is published at last, and he proposes to Ann, whose happiness is now complete and the movie suddenly goes from black and white to color to imply Ann's feeling that everything is finally as it should be in her life."
Bay of Angels,1963,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0056846/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Jean is a clerk in a bank. His colleague Caron is a gambler and gives him the virus. In the casinos, Jean meets Jackie. Their love affair will follow their luck at the roulette.—Yepok Jean Fournier is a young Parisian bank clerk who laments his rather poor pay. He is inherently a conservative man, much of his life centered on doing things with his widowed father, with who he still lives, rather than eking out his own life, and is risk averse. That latter issue is why he is hesitant to accompany his colleague Caron to the casino, Caron, who has the same pay as Jean, able to purchase a car with a gambling windfall, buying a car which Jean cannot even fathom on his wages. Even Jean's first win at the roulette table, which gives him a taste of the euphoria of gambling, is somewhat with mixed emotions in not believing in getting something for really doing nothing. Regardless, Jean, rather than go off on a regular family vacation, takes Caron's suggestion to holiday on the French Riviera where there are many more casinos. There, Jean meets Jackie Demaistre, a woman he and Caron saw being thrown out of a casino in Enghien for allegedly cheating. More than Caron, Jackie is able to convince Jean to go beyond his usual comfort zone while gambling. As an emotional connection forms between the two, the question becomes if their relationship is sustainable as it is based largely on their connection to gambling, as they go into it with different perspectives - Jackie whose addiction is not based on money for money's sake as she only squanders away whatever she may win and is willing to hit rock bottom on the possibility of winning, while Jean does it solely for the potential for the financial windfall and in his conservatism always wants to have a rainy day fund - and as those different perspectives may be a chasm they cannot or will not cross for the other.—Huggo"

Billy Liar,1963,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0056868/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A lazy, irresponsible young clerk (Sir Tom Courtenay) in provincial Northern England lives in his own fantasy world and makes emotionally immature decisions as he alienates friends and family. Going nowhere fast, Billy Fisher, an incorrigible fantasizer, dreams incessantly of escaping his drab existence and humdrum routine work as an undertakers' clerk in Yorkshire. Seeking refuge from his working-class family and not one but two demanding fiancees in the imaginary country called Ambrosia, more and more, Billy finds himself cut off from reality, picturing himself as its ruler and hero. Then, as Billy's fabrications grow increasingly wilder and problems start piling up, lovely, happy-go-lucky Liz enters the young day-dreamer's life, offering a way out of this fine mess. However, new beginnings are always scary, and Billy must make up his mind: it's either a fresh start in London or an endless beautiful lie in Ambrosia.—Nick Riganas Living with his middle class judgmental parents and his ailing maternal grandmother in Yorkshire, and working as a clerk at Shadrack and Duxbury Funeral Furbishers under Mr. Shadrack himself, young adult Billy Fisher often daydreams as a means of escape from what he considers his less than satisfying life, and in the process will tell bald-faced lies to advance his fantasy narrative. While those daydreams are often what he is feeling at any given moment in what he would like to happen in needing to get out of a predicament of his own making, he has a recurring fantasy of being the military ruler of a fictional country called Ambrosia, those scenarios mostly in grand pomp and circumstance for him. The latest lie he is perpetuating is that he has been hired by comedian Danny Boon to be his script writer, entailing a move to London. While he did indeed write to the celebrity in his quest to be a writer of some sort, he only got a noncommittal form letter from Boon's representatives in return (i.e. no one in Boon's entourage actually read what he sent Boon, including Boon himself), he planning on approaching Boon, who coincidentally is in town, to nail down the details of employment. Another one of the predicaments he's gotten himself into is that he is stringing along two different women, Barbara and Rita, who don't know or know of the other, and who, also unknown them, are ""sharing"" one engagement ring, which Billy has to manage to transfer between them in some manner through more lies. The other thing that neither Barbara or Rita knows is that Billy loves neither of them, getting married which he is feeling pressured to do by his parents. While his actions alienate more and more people, the person who does understand what he is feeling is recently returned free-spirit Liz, an ex-girlfriend who, in feeling much what he has felt about the dead end life in Yorkshire, has left in running from Yorkshire as opposed to running to somewhere or something else, for her the process more important than the outcome.—Huggo Billy (Tom Courtenay), a young British clerk in a gloomy North Country undertaker's office, is bombarded daily by the propaganda of the media that all things are for the asking. This transparently-false doctrine, coupled with the humdrum job and his wild imagination, leads him on frequent flights to ""Ambrosia"", a mythical kingdom where he is crowned King, General, lover, or any idealized hero the real situation of the moment makes him desire. His vacillating commitment and post-adolescent immaturity have created situations which make Ambrosia all the more attractive. He's succeeded in becoming engaged to two different girls simultaneously, while in love with a third, Liz (Julie Christie). He's in hot water with his employer, having spent a rather large sum of postage money on his personal frivolities. Last but not least, his dream of becoming a highly-paid, famous scriptwriter in London seems doomed.

From the dark depths of terror, can the truth shine?—Nick Riganas Lt. Duvalier (Jack Nicholson), separated from his regiment, rides his horse along the coastline, hopelessly lost. His compass having failed, he throws it away and continues on. Passing out from thirst and fatigue, he falls from his horse on the beach. This is noticed by Stefan (Dick Miller), servant of Baron Von Leppe (Boris Karloff), from a rocky cliff. Awakened by the incoming tide, he gets up and notices a girl (Sandra Knight) standing in the hollow of an offshore rock formation where the waves crash through. Calling out to her, he asks if she has drinking water. She makes her way back to shore saying nothing. He follows her to a mountain spring flowing from rocks into the sea. She tells him he may drink of this clear water. He crouches and cups the water in his hands to drink and splash his face. As he straightens up to thank her, she seems to have vanished. Looking around, he sees her drawing spring water from a bucket tied to a rope. He engages her in conversation and she says her name is Helene. He follows her through the forest and up the mountain, ending up back on the beach, where she heads back to the rock opening in the sea. He calls to her and questions her but she stares blindly. Wading back into the sea, he follows her but is attacked by a falcon. He struggles with the bird for a few moments and passes out when a wave overcomes him.He comes to in a shack, covered by a blanket. He looks up and sees Helene smiling at him. Suddenly the image becomes the face of an old woman, Katrina (Dorothy Neumann) the witch. She offers him some tonic from an old bottle, poured into a wooden spoon which she urges him to take. He asks about Helene, but the old woman indicates that it is the falcon, which is seen fluttering its wings. He tells her the bird attacked him but she denies this, trying to show that the bird is friendly. He tells her to take it away and asks about the girl. She says there is no girl, that maybe he had a pleasant illusion. She introduces Gustaf (Jonathan Haze) a mute, who enters. She says it was he who rescued Duvalier and tended to his horse. Later, he is awakened by the window shutter blown by the wind. Getting up, he sees the bird eating a mouse and then flying out an open window. Noticing on the table the blue dress the girl wears when she is Ilsa, he leaves and follows the bird through the forest, finding the girl by the rocky stream again. He speaks to her and she approaches, not speaking. She rests her head on his shoulder, then kisses him and walks away. He follows her through the forest until he runs into Gustaf, who speaks in a whisper, warning him to wait. Picking up a large rock, Gustaf throws it onto the ground where it begins to sink. Realizing the girl was leading him to quicksand, Duvalier tells Gustaf she meant to kill him. Gustaf tells him the girl is possessed and has no mind of her own. He tells the officer to seek her at the Von Leppe castle and that Eric knows the story. Citing danger, Gustaf runs away. Returning to the shack, Duvalier draws a picture of the girl. The witch comes in and suggests he leave to rejoin his regiment. He asks for Gustaf, but is told that he is away. When questioned about why he wants Gustaf, Duvalier replies he wants him to show him the way to the Barons castle. She asks what he wants with the Baron, to which he says he didnt say he was interested in the Baron, but believes the girl lives there. She says the castle has been uninhabited for many years. He says he will find it himself. She warns him not to go, saying there is no girl. He shows her the drawing, which brings a noticeable reaction of recognition to her face. As he leaves, she tells him not to deal with things he doesnt understand. Even though she told him the Baron was dead, she begs him not to inform the Baron that she is living there.Riding along on his horse on mountain roads, he encounters a small avalanche but sees no one who could have caused it. He returns to the spring to splash water on his face, and standing again sees the castle high on a mountaintop. Arriving at the castle in full uniform, he ties his horse and enters the outer courtyard, looking up around him and calling out to see if anyone is home. The girl appears at the window but says nothing. He approaches and knocks on the large oaken doors. Getting no response, the officer shouts that the door should be opened in the name of the government of France. Opening the door is Baron Von Leppe, who says he didnt hear the knock. Inquiring what a French soldier would want, and being told shelter, for one, the Baron suggests he would find better accommodations in the village. Refusing that, Duvalier tells him that he would not want to inconvenience a French officer and is admitted entrance.
The Baron and the officer talk and sit at a table where a drink is offered. Stefan enters upon command and is told to fetch cognac for our guest. As the drinks are poured, Duvalier asks about the girl, which brings a surprise to the Barons face. He shows the officer a painting of the Baroness Ilsa Von Leppe, now deceased, which bears resemblance to the girl seen. Insisting the girl is very young and active, Duvalier insults the Baron, who tells him you are speaking of the Baroness Von Leppe, my wife. He is told that Stefan will show him to his room.During the night, when the girl walks through the cemetery, the horse is spooked and forces open the stable door and escapes. Duvalier is studying the drawing when the wind blows into the room and extinguishes the candles. Looking out the window, he sees Helene walking toward the chapel and calls to her to wait until he comes down. She goes inside the chapel, which leads to a mausoleum. Finding his door is locked from the outside, he finds something to try and get the door open. He hears a scrambling and screeching at the door, as if someone is there. Fetching his pistol, he calls for the door to be unlocked, threatening to shoot. At the sound of the door unlocking, he opens it and finds no one. Going downstairs, he goes outside and enters the chapel. Here he observes the crypt entrance to the Baroness Ilsa Von Leppe. He re-enters the castle and notices that the portrait is missing from its frame. Returning to his room, he finds the drawing of the girl ripped apart down the middle.Later, the Baron is eating and speaking with his servant, who suggests maybe the officer has heard rumors in the village. The Baron says that is nonsense, but tells Stefan that Duvalier should leave as soon as possible, cautioning that proper respect is shown the Lieutenant.Coming back to the chapel, Duvalier is questioned by Stefan of his purpose. The officer reminds the servant that he must remember his place. When the name of Eric is mentioned, Stefan shows recognition, but tells the officer to not meddle in affairs of the dead. Duvalier says he will tend to his horse, but the servant stops him, telling him the horse bolted during the night and that he will get him another from the village.Duvalier enters the castle and confronts the Baron abruptly. Incensed, the Baron confesses to the murder of his wife twenty years ago. When he had gone away to war, he returned a year later to find her with another man. It is revealed than Stefan killed her lover and that the Baron has mourned and remained in the castle all these years. It is believed the ghost of Ilsa began coming two years ago and now the Baron looks forward to seeing her.Gustaf talks with Helene on a cliff overlooking the ocean. He tells her that her name is Ilsa and not to trust the old woman. She tells him the witch summoned her from the sea and he says she must return to the sea. He mentions that the Frenchman can help her. At this point the falcon appears and the girl empathically receives a message from the old woman, warning Gustaf not to interfere and that the witch will no longer tolerate him.Stefan goes by night to the witchs shack and observes through the window as she prepares a potion which she pours into a basin, causing a flash of light. Now the girl is seen being hypnotized by the witch, who is using a multi-colored rotating lantern and a magnifying glass while chanting words in Latin. She tells the spirit of Ilsa to fully inhabit the girls body and mind, so the witch can have her vengeance. When the spell is complete, Stefan observes the chair empty. Confronting the old witch, Stefan tells her to leave by tomorrow (for she is squatting on the Barons land) or he will return and burn the shack down. She asks if he knew who lived there years ago and he repeats the question back to her. Eric, she replies.Back at the castle, Stefan tells the Baron that the Frenchman refuses to leave and suggests they kill him. The Baron absolutely refuses and warns him to stay away from the crypt. Meanwhile, Duvalier explores rooms in the castle. He finds a gun case containing two pistols which he examines. Before leaving the room, he finds the missing portrait inside an armoire. Coming out into the hall, he hears the Baron approaching and hides in a room. Then he follows the Baron, who goes to his own room. Duvalier hears voices inside, including the girls. Impulsively he bursts into the room to find only the Baron sitting. Rising quickly, the Baron accuses him of rudely intruding into his bedroom unannounced. After an apology, Duvalier confesses he thought he heard voices. He is lambasted by the Baron, who informs him that he should leave as soon as Stefan returns from the village with a new horse. The officer agrees. When Stefan arrives and presents the animal to Duvalier, he explains that the Barons ways may seem strange to an outsider and that he fears the Baron has never recovered from the death of his wife. Before leaving, the officer asks who Eric is. It is revealed that Eric was the Baronesss lover when the Baron returned from the war.Wandering the beach on his steed, the officer sees Gustaf walking along the cliffsides. At one point he is signaling by waving his arms for Duvalier to go back. The officer stops to observe. Suddenly the falcon appears and attacks Gustaf. After a struggle the bird has pecked out Gustafs eyes and disappeared. Bloody and blind, Gustaf stumbles around and falls off the cliff to rocks below. The officer hurries down and with his last words, Gustaf tells him that the girl loves Duvalier and her soul should be freed tonight if he will return to the castle.That night the officer returns and sees the girl waiting at the door of the chapel. He approaches and they go inside. After a greeting and kiss, they sit and she tells him this is the only place she is free from the spell (inside the chapel). He tells her that she is free everywhere when she is with him. He suggests doctors who can help her in Paris if she will accompany him. There is an agreement and another reassuring kiss. They emerge together from the chapel and Duvalier tells her to wait at the chapel gate. He walks away but when he looks back, she is gone.Back inside the castle, the officer sees the Baron open a portcullis by pulling a chain and pulley, then entering. As he follows, the Baron twists a candlestick and opens a secret door leading down to the crypt below. [This scene is also seen at the beginning of the film.] The Baron is seen kneeling over the coffin of his wife and speaking to her. Her voice can be heard telling him to kill himself by flooding the crypt so they can be together. He says he cannot do this unforgivable sin. She insists he must.

After unsuccessfully calling for Helene, he sees to the collapsed Baron. Upstairs, Stefan attends to the Baron who is in his bed. The officer is told that this sickness is based on what happens when the girls spirit torments the Baron and that he will soon recover. Duvalier asks for keys to the chapel and they go. Unable to open the door leading to the crypt, the officer asks for a crowbar. As they go outside, Stefan pauses, noticing a light being carried in the tower window. He tells Duvalier that room has been sealed since the death twenty years ago. They hurry upstairs. When told that only the Baron has the room key, Duvalier kicks open the door. They look inside and the officer finds and asks about a childs crib found there. At this moment the Baron arrives and gives Stefan a gun to escort Duvalier from the castle, telling him to shoot if he resists. Another conversation between Ilsa and the Baron convinces him to commit suicide.Outside, the officer is warned by the servant never to return at risk of death. At this point the girl is seen in front of the chapel. Duvalier struggles with Stefan, finally knocking him out with the gun. As he follows the girl into the cemetery, suddenly the witch appears from behind a tombstone. He grabs her arm, threatening her, only to see the falcon approaching to kill him. Cocking the gun, he tells Katrina to call off the bird. She does, informing him that it doesnt matter because tonight the Baron will pay with his own immortal soul for the offence against her. He asks what offence the Baron did her. She tells him that the Baron killed Eric, her son.Stefan, recovered from his blow, returns to the castle to see the Baron raise the portcullis to enter. He tries to interfere, but is struck in the head. Going to the front doors, he opens to Duvalier, who seizes him and asks where the Baron is. He is told that the Baron has gone downstairs to flood the crypt. The officer tells Stefan that the old woman lured Helene to coax the Baron into killing himself to avenge the death of her son Eric, not knowing that it was really Stefan who killed him. Enraged, the witch tries to attack Stefan, who reveals that it was not Eric who was killed that night, but the Baron. For twenty years Eric has pretended to be the Baron. The witch realizes that her son and the girl will soon die in the flood. The officer and the servant rush into the castle and try to follow the Baron. When they are unable to open the secret door, Stefan takes an ax to try to open it. Duvalier says he will try to enter through the chapel. As he runs to the chapel, he grabs the old womans arm, saying he will need her. She fights and cries no, citing that she may not enter the house of God, for she has made her pact with the devil. She breaks away from him at the threshold and turns back to the gate, where she is struck by lightning and her body bursts into flames and is consumed. Duvalier watches in stupefaction, then goes into the chapel. Unable to open the crypt door, he gets a pry bar and works on it. Meanwhile, the Baron, hearing Ilsas voice, pries open the coffin, revealing the body covered in a shroud. She tells him to flood the crypt and he does so, turning a large spindle that opens an underground floodgate. She tells him to look at her by removing the shroud. When he does, he is horrified to see her rotten corpse. She confesses that she is the spirit of Ilsa who has tricked him into giving his soul so hers can be free. Then she calls him Eric. He goes to undo the spindle and the girl struggles with him as the waters flood the room. Stefan, having broken through the secret door, hurries downstairs. Seeing them struggling in the water, Stefan dives in and tries to separate them. The foundations of the castle break under the pressure of the floods and begin to collapse. Finally Duvalier breaks through the crypt door and rushes through underground passages to find the three of them in the water. Diving in, he removes the girl from the water and carries her out. The bodies of Stefan and the Baron are shown in the water, face down. The officer carries Helene outside the chapel and leans her up against a tree. He tells her she is safe now and free. She opens her eyes and looks at him. Free? she replies. He kisses her, but soon recoils in horror as her face begins to bleed and deteriorate. As he looks away and then looks back, her face is melting away to bone."

A wealthy businessman is told his son has been kidnapped and he will have to pay a very large sum for him to be returned safely. It is then discovered that his son is safe at home: the kidnapper took his chauffeur's son by accident. The kidnapper says this makes no difference: pay up or the child dies. This leaves him with a moral dilemma, as he really needs the money to conclude a very important business deal.—grantss Kingo Gondo, the factory manager at National Shoes, which is known for manufacturing durable but plain footwear, lives with his wife Reiko and their adolescent son Jun in a lavish house atop a hill overlooking the city of Yokohama. At 13%, he is also one of the company's largest shareholders, he able to acquire those shares because of Reiko's family's wealth. There is a power struggle going on within the company with some of the smaller executive shareholders wanting him to join forces with them in a coup over who they call disrespectfully ""The Old Man"", the company CEO, they wanting to move the company into manufacturing stylish but disposable footwear. In dismissing those executives in not wanting to go the disposable route, Gondo does not tell them or Kawanishi, his faithful assistant of ten years, that he plans his own coup in borrowing heavily to acquire enough shares to take over the company to move into the production of still durable yet modernly styled footwear. Just as he is about to purchase those shares to enact his plan, someone within his sphere of existence is kidnapped, the unknown kidnapper's ransom demand from him being an exorbitant sum in return for not killing the kidnap victim, and for him not to involve the police. The ransom sum would take up the entire amount that he has just borrowed, he paying it which would ruin him financially and not allow him to carry out his plan for the company. As the evidence points to the kidnapper having a personal agenda beyond just extortion, the executives who Gondo dismissed are among the suspects. As the process progresses, which eventually does include the police led by Inspector Tokura, Gondo may see his financial fortunes and his morals ebb and flow along with it.—Huggo An executive mortgages all he owns to stage a coup and gain control of the National Shoe Company, with the intent of keeping the company out of the hands of incompetent and greedy executives. He needs the same money, though, to pay the ransom that will possibly save a child's life. His resolution of that dilemma -- the certain loss of the company vs. the probable loss of the child -- makes for one distinct drama, and an ensuing elaborate police procedure makes for a second.—levin <levin@world.std.com> At a crucial point in his business life, executive Gondo learns that his son has been kidnapped and that the ransom demanded is near the amount Gondo has raised for a critical business deal. Gondo is prepared to pay the ransom - that is, until he learns that the kidnappers have mistakenly abducted not Gondo's son, but the child of Gondo's chauffeur. Now Gondo must decide whether the other man's child is equally worth saving.—Jim Beaver <jumblejim@prodigy.net> A wealthy executive named Kingo Gondo (Toshiro Mifune) is in a struggle to gain control of a company called National Shoes. One faction wants the company to make cheap, low quality shoes for the impulse market as opposed to the sturdy and high quality shoes currently being produced. Gondo believes that the long-term future of the company will be best served by well-made shoes with modern styling, though this plan is unpopular because it means lower profits in the short term. He has secretly set up a leveraged buyout to gain control of the company, mortgaging all he has.Just as he is about to put his plan into action, he receives a phone call from someone claiming to have kidnapped his son, Jun. Gondo is prepared to pay the ransom, but the call is dismissed as a prank when Jun comes in from playing outside. However, Jun's playmate, Shinichi, the child of Gondo's chauffeur, is missing and the kidnappers have mistakenly abducted him instead.In another phone call the kidnapper reveals that he has discovered his mistake but still demands the same ransom. Gondo is now forced to make a decision about whether to pay the ransom to save the child or complete the buyout. After a long night of contemplation Gondo announces that he will not pay the ransom, explaining that doing so would not only mean the loss of his position in the company, but cause him to go into debt and throw the futures of his wife and son into jeopardy. His plans are weakened when his top aide lets the ""cheap shoes"" faction know about the kidnapping in return for a promotion should they take over. Finally, after continuous pleading from the chauffeur and under pressure from his wife, Gondo decides to pay the ransom. Following the kidnapper's instructions, the money is put into two small briefcases and thrown out from a moving train; Shinichi is found unharmed.Gondo is forced out of the company and his creditors demand the collateral in lieu of debt. The story is widely reported however, making Gondo a hero, while the National Shoe Company is vilified and boycotted. Meanwhile, the police eventually find the hideout where Shinichi was kept prisoner. The bodies of the kidnapper's two accomplices are found there, killed by an overdose of heroin. The police surmise that the kidnapper engineered their deaths by supplying them with uncut drugs. Further clues lead to the identity of the kidnapper, a medical intern at a nearby hospital, but there is no hard evidence linking him to the accomplices' murders.The police lay a trap by first planting a false story in the newspapers implying that the accomplices are still alive, and then forging a note from them demanding more drugs. The kidnapper is then apprehended in the act of trying to supply another lethal dose of uncut heroin to his accomplices, after testing the strength on a drug addict who overdoses and dies. Most of the ransom money is recovered, but too late to save Gondo's property from auction. With the kidnapper facing a death sentence, he requests to see Gondo while in prison and Gondo finally meets him face to face. Gondo has gone to work for a rival shoe company, earning less money but enjoying a free hand in running it. The kidnapper at first feigns no regrets for his actions. As he reveals that envy from seeing Gondo's house on the hill every day led him to conceive of the crime, his emotions gradually gain control over him and he ends up breaking down emotionally before Gondo after finally facing his failure."

A group of young boys are stranded alone on an island. Left to fend for themselves, they must take on the responsibilities of adults, even if they are not ready to do so.

His group starts hunting and chasing pigs, stealing the possession of Ralph's group and even killing people.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil In the hands of the renowned experimental theater director Peter Brook, William Golding's legendary novel about the primitivism lurking beneath civilization becomes a film as raw and ragged as the lost boys at its center.

Ralph, one of the older boys, is voted leader, and efforts are made to set up a society which will enable them to survive. By reflecting the sun through eyeglasses belonging to the fat and asthmatic Piggy, they start a signal fire for rescue planes. Jack, the bully of the lot, appoints himself chief hunter, and he and his aides track down and kill a wild pig, the head of which they mount on a sharpened stick as an offering to the unknown beast they believe lives on the mountain top. Actually, the ""beast"" is the body of a dead pilot; and what has terrified the children in the night is the fluttering of his parachute. Eventually a fight ensues between Ralph and Jack, and the latter takes his followers to another part of the island, where they paint their bodies and faces and revert to a savage, primitive life. One night, during a frenzied ritual featuring war dances and chanting, they hear a rustle in the underbrush and brutally slay the innocent Simon, who came to tell them he had learned the true identity of the beast. Now completely savage, the boys kill the helpless Piggy and then set out after Ralph, planning to offer him as a sacrifice to the beast. They chase him across the island until they come face to face with a rescue party. Confronted once more by civilization, the boys break off their pursuit and begin weeping."

Reluntantly, he agrees to bury the child without taking the necessary precautions.That same night, the child rises from his grave and begs to be invited into the cottage. The mother runs to her son's aid, stabbing Giorgio when he attempts to stop her, only to be greeted at the front door by Gorcha. The old man bits and infects his daughter-in-law, who then does the same for her husband. Vladimir and Sdenka flee from the cottage and go on the run and hide out in the ruins of an abandoned cathedral as dawn breaks. Vladimir is optimistic that a long and happy life lies with them. But Sdenka is reluctant to relinquish her family ties. She believes that she is meant to stay with the family.Sdenka's fears about her family are confirmed when that evening, Gorcha and her siblings show up at the abandoned Abby. As Vladimir sleeps, Sdenka is lured into their loving arms where they bite to death. Awakened by her screams, Vladimir rushes to her aid, but the family has already taken her home, forcing the lover to follow suite. The young nobleman finds her, lying motionless on her bed. Sdenka awakens, and a distinct change is visible on her face. No longer caring, Vladimir embraces her, and she bites and infects him too.THE DROP OF WATERIn Victorian London, England, Nurse Helen Chester (Jacqueline Pierreux) is called to a large house to prepare the corpse of an elderly medium for her burial. As she dressed the body, she notices an elaborate diamond ring on its finger. Tempted by greed, Nurse Chester steals it. As she does, a glass tips over, and drops of water begin to splash on the floor. She is also assailed by a fly, no doubt attracted by the odor of the body. Unsettled but pleased by her acquisition, she finishes the job and returns home to her small East End flat.After returning home, Nurse Chester is assailed by strange events. The buzzing fly returns and continues to pester her. Then the lights in her apartment go out, and the sounds of the dripping water continues with maddening regularity. She sees the old womans corpse lying on her bed, and coming towards her. The terrified woman begs for forgiveness, but she ultimately strangles herself, imaging that the medium's hands are gripping her throat.The next morning, the concierge (Harriet White Medin) discovers Nurse Chester's body and calls the police. The investigator on the scene (Gustavo de Nardo) quickly concludes that its a simple case and that Nurse Chester ""died of fright"". The pathologist arrives on the scene to examine the body before it's taken away and he notes that the only sign of violence is a small bruise on her left finger, mostly likely caused when someone pried a ring from her finger. As the doctor makes this observation, the concierge appears distressed, as she has apparently took the ring from the dead Nurse Chester, and is further distracted by the sound of a fly swooping about in the air....Boris Karloff makes a final appearance as Gorcha riding on his horse as he concludes the three tales of fear and tells the viewers to be careful while walking home at night for ghosts and vampires have no fear. The image pulls back to actually reveal him sitting on a prop fake horse with a camera crew and various crewmen moving branches around to simulate the scene of riding through the forest from the Wurdalak segment."

Thompson <thompson@amath.washington.edu> Initially deviated by the trouble of adjustments and some local opinions about Mother Maria, Smith finally makes-up his mind to build the Chapel. The movie features how a selfless devotion can inspire a person to find a motive in life and restores faith in the mankind.—Upendra Handa When traveling African-American handyman Homer Smith stops by a farm in rural Arizona, he is welcomed by a group of Roman Catholic nuns who have emigrated from Germany. Realizing that the farm needs a lot of work, Homer takes on a number of repair projects for the women, who are led by the headstrong Mother Maria. Impressed by Homer's kindness and strong work ethic, the nuns come to believe that he has been sent by God to help build them a chapel.—Jwelch5742 While traveling through the American southwest in moving from job to job as an itinerant laborer, Homer Smith, a black man, makes a stop in rural Arizona solely for water for his overheating radiator. He is initially unaware that where he has stopped is a convent, the five Caucasian women tending the land and living in the building Catholic nuns originally from Central Europe - most German who solely speak German - who emigrated during the war at great expense when the property was donated to them. They exist on a subsistence living, meaning that in this arid climate they generally have little food for the table. Regardless, Mother Maria, who speaks the most English, feigning not understanding when it suits her purpose, believes big, strong Homer, a Baptist, was sent to them from God. While she is able to convince him to fix their roof - he initially unaware that they have no money to pay him beyond that meager amount of food and board - she, via God, has a grander design for him: to build them a chapel. He learns that Father Murphy, the traveling Irish priest who presides over their services, holds mass outdoors adjacent to a nearby rural truck stop. Even in learning the situation in its entirety, Homer, if he is to help them build the chapel, has to earn a living somehow, and while he is able to provide them his labor - and willingly his services as an English teacher to the five collectively - he cannot provide the materials which is up to Mother Maria to source with no money.

During the course of the movie his determination convinces the members of the community, believer and un-believer to contribute materials and labor to the task.The chapel is eventually completed, the Mother Superior unbends a little, the community unites and Smith hits the road with their respect and thanks, and a feeling of personal accomplishment.A movie with subtle depth, great characters and a ""watch it again"" appeal that is not found in many of the current (1980-to date) movies, and which the bulk of these have failed to deliver.One of the many high-lights of this film is the Gospel song: Amen sung by Portier and the nuns.Let's face it. You can watch the fated lovers on the Titanic only so many times.This movie is timeless in its appeal."

The head of the local aristocratic family offers his assistance with dire consequences.—bcarruthers-76500 Gerald [Edward de Souza] and Marianne [Jennifer Daniel] Harcourt are motoring through Europe on their honeymoon when their car runs out of petrol. Looking out over the valley from his chateau window, Dr Ravna [Noel Willman] sees them, but cannot do anything before Gerald goes for help, leaving Marianne in the car. Gerald gets a tow to the nearest hotel, where they take a room for the night. There are no other guests, save for Professor Zimmer [Clifford Evans], who spends much of his time drinking. The owners, Anna [Vera Cook] and Bruno [Peter Madden], try to make the newlyweds' stay a happy one, but they are obviously troubled by
something and haven't had guests in a long time, attested to by the sheets over the furniture and remarks like, ""Nobody ever stays here anymore."" But no one will say why. While Gerald and Marianne take tea in their room, a letter arrives for them. It is from Dr Ravna, inviting them to dine with him. When Bruno tells them that Dr Ravna's table is the best in the country, they decide to go.Gerald and Marianne find the pheasant and wine to be tasty, Dr Ravnos to be a charming host, and his son Carl [Barry Warren] is a fine pianist. When Carl plays one of his own compositions, Marianne is almost entranced. As an added surprise, Dr Ravna says that he's sending for some petrol for their car, but it may take several days. Gerald and Marianne return to their hotel. It's late, and Marianne is tired, but not tired enough not to hear Anna sobbing in a room down the hall. Marianne peeks in and sees Anna sitting on the floor, going through some clothes and photos of her daughter Tania, who has been lost to Ravna.The next day, Carl Ravna and his sister Sabena [Jacquie Wallis] drop by the hotel to invite Gerald and Marianne to a party they are giving on Saturday night. It's going to be a gala. Ravna is bringing in a chef from Paris and an orchestra from Vienna, and Carl and Sabena offer to loan Gerald and Marianne formal clothes so they don't have to worry about their dress. Gerald invites them in for a drink, but they leave quickly when Professor Zimmer informs that the weather is changing...the sun is coming out.It's a masked ball. Marianne is given a black mask, and Gerald is given a red devil mask. Carl and Marianne dance and dance. When Marianne takes a break and wonders where Gerald has gone, Carl switches his mask for one like that being worn by Gerald and, without saying a word, he leads Marianne upstairs, where he abruptly pushes her into a room and locks the door. Marianne is alone, except for Dr Ravna, who mesmerizes her and then bites her neck. Gerald is chatting downstairs with Sabena and drinking a bit too much champagne. He wonders where Marianne is, but Sabena offers him one more ""special"" class of champagne. Gerald drinks it and begins to feel faint, so Sabena takes him upstairs so that he can lie down.The party-goers suddenly take off their masks, change into white gowns, and enter a ceremonial chamber where Ravna introduces Marianne as a new disciple. When Gerald wakes up, there is no evidence of any party, and everyone denies knowing Marianne. Carl tells Gerald that he came alone, drank too much, and had to sleep it off. They throw Gerald out, where he is later found laying in the road by Professor Zimmer who takes him back to the hotel. Bruno also denies knowing Marianne, and all her clothes are gone. Not even the police believe him. Only Zimmer remembers, and he tells Gerald that Marianne is being held at Ravna's chateau. Zimmer knows about the vampires. He tells Gerald about his own daughter who was made into a vampire by Ravna.That night, Gerald goes to the castle. He happens upon Tania [Isobel Black] and asks for her help. Tania leads him straight to Ravna, who calls for Marianne. Marianne, obviously entranced, doesn't want anything to do with Gerald. To prove it, she spits in his face. Ravna then tells Tania to ""initiate"" Gerald. Tania scratches his chest, drawing blood. As she bends forward to bite his neck, Gerald pushes her away and makes a cross on his chest using his own blood. At that moment, Zimmer enters the room. They grab Marianne and take her back to the hotel. Zimmer has placed crosses drawn with distillation of garlic on all the entrances to the chateau, which seals the vampires inside. Tonight is the full moon, he says, and Capricorn is in conjunction with Saturn, a perfect night for performing a ritual that he's been working on to destroy the vampires. While Zimmer prepares, Ravna summons Marianne, who starts walking back to the castle. When Gerald discovers that Marianne is gone, he and Father Xavier [Noel Howlett] pursue. Zimmer summons a scourge of bats that fly into the castle and bite all the vampires to death, which releases Marianne from her trance.NOTE: US version has the following story interwoven with the one above.The Stanghers live in the same village as Dr Ravna.

The Day of the Triffids,1963,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0055894/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"After an unusual meteor shower leaves most of the human population blind, a merchant navy officer must find a way to conquer tall, aggressive plants which are feeding on people and animals. A shower of meteorites produces a glow that blinds anyone that looks at it. As it was such a beautiful sight, most people were watching, and as a consequence, 99% of the population go blind. In the original novel, this chaos results in the escape of some Triffids: experimental plants that are capable of moving themselves around and attacking people. In the film version, however, the Triffids are not experimental plants. Instead they are space aliens whose spores have arrived in an earlier meteor shower.—Murray Chapman <muzzle@cs.uq.oz.au>, edited by Triffid Fan On a beautiful clear night, people around the world are treated to a spectacular meteor shower. In London, Bill Masen misses the show as he is in hospital with his eyes bandaged. The next morning he awakens to find no one answering his bell. He removes the bandages himself and soon realizes that he one of the few people with sight as everyone who observed the meteor shower is now blind. Society has broken down and Bill rescues a young sighted girl. Their challenge is not only to survive in this new world but to survive the onslaught of triffids, flesh eating plants that are now growing rapidly and consuming humans.—garykmcd Inspired by the 1951 novel by John Wyndham, the movie opens with a shot of an idyllic pond and botanical garden. A narrator tells us, ""In nature's scheme of things there are certain plants which are carnivorous, or eating plants. The Venus Fly Trap is one of the best known of these plants. A fly, drawn to the plant by a sweet syrup, brushes against trigger bristles. Just how these plants digest their prey has yet to be explained. This is a new comer, triffidus celestus, brought to earth on the meteorites during The Day of the Triffids."" Title and credits follow.With Big Ben in the foreground, we see the night sky of London flashing brightly with meteors entering the atmosphere. At the Royal Botanic Gardens, a guard (Ian Wilson) enters a greenhouse on his evening rounds. With flashlight in hand, he examines the plants. In response to the meteoric flashes of light, the three triffid specimens begin a growth spurt. Satisfied all is in order, the watchman peers out through the greenhouse glass to enjoy the light show in the night sky. Dr. Soames (Ewan Roberts) and Nurse Jamieson (Colette Wilde) watch the evening sky before they return to their patient, Bill Masen (Howard Keel) who is in bed with his eyes covered in bandages. His surgery was nine days ago and Dr. Soames insists Bill wait the full ten days before the bandages be removed. Bill is annoyed that he is missing the meteor shower. At a lighthouse off the coast of Cornwall, we are introduced to a husband and wife team of marine researchers. Tom Goodwin (Kieron Moore) and Karen Goodwin (Janette Scott) are experiencing a rough patch in their marriage. His fondness for alcohol makes him somewhat cynical and unpleasant company. Karen is trying to salvage their marriage, but it is not reciprocated. Karen decides it best to leave the island and their research when the boat returns to the lighthouse the next morning.At the Botanic Garden the guard is settling down to his lunch. By this time the triffids have grown too large for their planter. The guard hears something and switches off his radio. He decides to go have a look, but only hears water dripping. One triffid goes for a stroll and flails at the guard with a whip like branch. It pulls the stunned man towards its mouth. Big Ben chimes nine a.m. At Moorfields Eye Hospital, Bill Masen counts the chime for each hour and is surprised. He was promised the bandages would be removed at 8 a.m. He calls out for the doctor and nurse. No one responds to his shouts or on the telephone. He walks out of his room and calls out but gets no reply. He stumbles back to bed and hears a woman scream. He quickly removes the bandages covering his eyes. At first his vision is blurry, but soon returns to normal focus. In the hallway outside his room things are scattered. The entire hospital looks like it's been ransacked. Dr. Soames meets Bill on the staircase and asks to be taken to his office. Bill shines a light in the doctor's eyes. Dr. Soames tells Bill, ""The optic nerves are gone. The glare of the meteorites last night. You're probably one of the few people left in London who can still see this morning, Masen."" Dr. Soames sends Bill out to his outer office to retrieve a bag. This is only a ruse to get Bill out of the exam room so the doctor can jump out of the window and plummet to his death below.Tom Goodwin, binoculars in hand, scans the horizon for the supply ship he is expecting. Karen tells her husband there is nothing on the radio. She sarcastically quips, ""I suppose you're losing valuable drinking time."" Tom finally finds a news frequency and they learn that nearly everyone in England is blind from watching the meteor shower. The newscaster adds, ""Urgent Warning. All of England appears to be infested with a strange new plant that can inflict a fatal sting. It is also rumored that this plant can uproot itself and move about. If you are blind, stay indoors."" With his seabag tossed over his shoulder, Bill leaves the hospital. He is walking and trying to find transportation back to his ship. He encounters wrecked vehicles and blind people wandering the streets. In the London Underground station Bill is accosted by desperate blind people seeking assistance. A locomotive crashes and blind people are scattered. Susan (Janina Faye) exits the train. A desperate blind man grabs Susan, but Bill rescues her. Susan explains to Bill that she is an orphan and ran away from her boarding school. She hid out in the luggage car all night. Bill and Susan witness a triffid kill a dog. They find an abandoned car and take it to get to Bill's ship. Along the way their car gets stuck in some dirt or sand. They search the nearby woods for rocks. Susan is chased back to the car by a triffid. As the car moves, the triffid sprays a green slime on the rear windshield. Bill and Susan drive to the docks and board Bill's ship. Ships at sea and aircraft in the air add to the chaos.Karen informs her husband that a triffid is growing outside. Armed with a hurricane lamp and a harpoon, the pair go outside to examine the plant, but it is gone. They decide to return to the lighthouse and discover it inside. Using the harpoon, Tom fights the creature and manages to lop its head off. Bill and Susan take a small launch across the channel and acquire a car in Paris. In the pouring rain, Bill and Susan are lost and examine a road map. They encounter a couple of women out on the street. Bill and Susan drive the pair back to their home. The woman, Christine Durrant (Nicole Maurey) can see, but the girl is blind. Mr. Coker (Mervyn Johns) meets the four in the courtyard. Coker can see as can his sister, Miss Coker (Alison Leggatt). The three have turned Miss Durrant's Chateau into a hostel for about forty blind people, Miss Durrant's neighbors. The Cokers and Christine met when they had an automobile accident. They were sedated and did not witness the light show. It is late and Susan is brought upstairs by Miss Coker to a dormitory area for the women. She is introduced to one of the blind guests, Bettina (Carole Ann Ford). Bill tries to impress upon his hostess that he is not optimistic about their chances at the Chateau and suggests going to Spain. There is an American military base there. Bill adds fuel to the auxiliary generator, so the Chateau now has electricity and lights.At the lighthouse, Tom and Karen devote their time and intellect to dissection and study of the dead triffid. Tom's interest is practical, ""If we can find out how this thing functions, we might figure out an easier way of killing it."" Karen convinces her husband to get some sleep. Their ""dead"" specimen begins to move on the table. While the Goodwins sleep, the triffid reassembles itself. It quietly ascends the stairs to their bedroom level. Karen is awakened by a crash below and gets up to investigate. She sees it slithering up the stairs and screams. Her scream scares it off. Tom discovers the lab area is a shambles and the front door broken out. Tom repairs the door as Karen observes, ""It's like being nailed in your own coffin."" Bill refills the fuel tank on the generator. Bettina enters the utility room to talk. She wants to confirm the story of Bill leaving for Spain. Bill and Coker are in town picking up (or perhaps looting) provisions for the Chateau. They see a triffid scooting through a meadow. Bill puts two rounds through the plant with a shotgun. It has no effect at all. In a crater Coker and Bill discover hundreds of growing triffids and spores blowing about. They investigate a plane crash and find themselves surrounded by triffids. Coker gets sprayed by a triffid and dies. When Bill returns to the Chateau, he hears loud music. Susan explains that convicts have taken over the house. Bill takes Susan outside to a Van then returns to the house to confront the convicts. Bill manages to rescue Christine, but Bettina is killed by the triffids. As Bill drives off with Susan and Christine, the triffids invade the house. Bill drives all night and into the morning until they arrive in Toulon. All they find in the city is fire and destruction. Christine asks where they are going now, and Bill tells her about an American Naval Base near Cadiz.Tom and Karen are back at work in their lab. After much testing they are no closer to discovering something that will affect the triffid tissue. Bill, Susan and Christine have made it into Spain, but have been reduced to a horse and cart. Bill and Christine are preparing a meal when they hear music coming from outside. Susan found a truck with a loudspeaker. The three drive the ""Totor Circo"" truck towards Cadiz. Along the dirt road they encounter a rope roadblock and a large, white stucco estate. They are met at the door by Luis de la Vega (Geoffrey Matthews). Next they meet his wife, Teresa de la Vega (Gilgi Hauser), a young pregnant woman very close to delivery time. Both are blind, although Teresa lost her sight years before. They agree to stay and help with the delivery. Luis explains to Bill that he heard a radio broadcast that the Naval Base at Cadiz was already evacuated by submarine. Bill agrees to look at the radio to see if he can repair same. While Susan helps Bill rig up an electric fence, Christine assists with the delivery of the de la Vega baby. Susan informs Bill and Christine of the approach of a forest of triffids. The electric fence has stopped them for the moment, but the current is weakening. Bill thinks fire might be the answer. The estate has a fuel truck, so Bill drives it close to the fence and using the hose like a flame thrower ignites the triffids. The plan works, but there are just too many triffids to burn. The next morning a new batch of plants are at the fence line. Susan speculates that perhaps the plants can hear and are attracted to sound. Shutting off the generator confirms their hypothesis. With everyone in the de la Vega car, except Bill, the plan is to meet up in Alacante near Gibraltar where a mass evacuation is being planned for the next day. Bill is going to use the truck and loudspeaker to attract the triffids. The plan works. The others arrive at the Naval Base and board a submarine. Bill is picked up by a raft near the shoreline.Tom and Karen hear of the rescue at Gibraltar on the radio. The triffids, growing hungry and impatient, break into the lighthouse and chase the Goodwins up to the top floor. With a long drop to the rocks and ocean below, Tom and Karen have no options left. Tom decides to use the fire hose like a water canon against the plants. Tom discovers to his relief and surprise that the salt water acts like an acid on the plants. They steam, smoke and dissolve when drenched. Tom observes, ""Seawater. Two-thirds of the Earth is covered with it. You hunt and you search and all the while the answer is right in front of you."" We close with Bill, Christine, and Susan joining others walking up and into a cathedral."

X: The Man with the X-Ray Eyes,1963,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0057693/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A doctor uses special eye drops to give himself x-ray vision, but the new power has disastrous consequences. Dr. James Xavier is a world renowned scientist experimenting with human eyesight. He devises a drug, that when applied to the eyes, enables the user to see beyond the normal realm of our sight (ultraviolet rays etc.) it also gives the user the power to see through objects. Xavier tests this drug on himself, when his funding is cut off. As he continues to test the drug on himself, Xavier begins to see, not only through walls and clothes, but through the very fabric of reality!—Brennan Storr The scientist Dr. James Xavier is researching an eye drops that increases the power of the vision. Dr. Xavier decides to test the drug on him and finds that his experiment gives X-Ray vision. However his research fund is cut off, despite the efforts of his friends Dr. Diane Fairfax and Dr. Sam Brant to explain its importance to the investors. Dr. Xavier proceeds testing the drug on himself and realizes the wrong diagnostic of a teenager that will be submitted to a heart surgery. Dr. Xavier does not allow the surgeon Dr. Willard Benson to carry out the surgery and is accused of malpractice. When Dr. Sam Brant tries to stop Dr. Xavier of using his eye drops again, he reacts and accidentally kills his friend. Dr. Xavier flees from the police and works blindfolded in a carnival ""guessing"" written information. However he is recognized and soon he invites Diane to travel abroad with him. But he decides to go to Las Vegas first to raise money in a casino, with tragic consequences.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil With humans only able to use ten percent of their vision spectrum, Los Angeles based Dr. James Xavier is doing research in the goal of increasing that vision spectrum to approach if not reach one hundred percent. Needing to update the foundation funding his research, the foundation's liaison being Dr. Diane Fairfax, he believes the most effective way to provide that meaningful report to the group of non-scientists at the foundation who will make the decision to continue or stop funding his research is to use himself as the test subject for the eye drops that he has developed. While the eye drops do accomplish what he had anticipated in seeing those results previously in his animal subjects, he may or may not have anticipated the uses of such increased vision and the consequences, including side effects, and long term use of the drops at higher doses.—Huggo Ray Milland plays Dr. James Xavier a brilliant scientist who understands that the human eye only perceives a tenth of the entire visual spectrum. Through his experiments he develops an eye drop that allows a monkey to see through hard material and his gal-pal Dr. Diane Fairfax (Diana Van der Vlis) is astounded at the discovery. Xavier turns to his friend Dr. Sam Brant (Harold J. Stone) to aid him in administering the drug on himself to record the details first hand, but Brant doesnt want to because too much is still unknown about the drug. Xavier goes forward with his plans and discovers a wealth of new visual abilities he didnt posses before. His ability to see through material prevents a miss-diagnosed surgery but puts him at odds with the attending physician at his hospital. Brant tries to prevent Xavier from continuing the drug because of the physical damage to his system. In the midst of an argument Xavier accidentally causes the death of Brant and Diane convinces Xavier to flee until he can pull himself together and explain what happened. Xavier drops out of sight until Diane tracks him down and discovers that by continually using the vision drug Xavier has developed a sensitivity that has caused shocking changes in the doctors persona. As the police close in and crosses paths with a religious preacher the doctor takes some actions that have drastic aftereffects."
The Silence,1963,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0057611/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Two estranged sisters, Ester and Anna, and Anna's 10-year-old son travel to the Central European country on the verge of war. Ester becomes seriously ill and the three of them move into a hotel in a small town called Timoka. ""The Silence"" is about the emotional distance between two sisters. The younger one is still attractive enough to pick up a lover in a strange city. The older one -- even though she is very ill -- would like to make a human connection also but cannot leave the hotel room. Traveling with the sisters is a small boy who escapes into the hotel, meets a troupe of dwarfs. Which sister is this little boy's mother?—Dale O'Connor <daleoc@interaccess.com> While traveling back home by train, Anna, her son Johan and her sister Ester that is very ill have to stop in a foreign country in Timoka City and checking-in a hotel until Ester recovers from a crisis of her illness. Ester is a translator but she does not speak the language, therefore they need to communicate by gestures with the locals. Ester is cult and controller and Anna is still attractive and very promiscuous. They are emotionally separated and without any sibling's feelings; therefore each sister just speaks to hurt the other while Johan wanders in the empty corridors of the hotel.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Two sisters, Esther and Anna, travel by train to a foreign city, where they speak a language they do not understand, in the company of Johan, Anna's son. Arriving at the hotel, Ester is not well while Anna goes in search of a sexual adventure. Between the chaos of the night, the two sisters confront each other and Ester confesses her rejection of heterosexual relationships and announces the proximity of her death. Recognized as one of the most sexually provocative films of his time, El Silencio offers a brilliant and disturbing vision of the desolation that exists in a suffocating spiritual void. Adult sisters Ester and Anna and Anna's ten year old son Johan are traveling across Europe by train trying to make their way home. Despite the country being on the brink of war, they make an unscheduled stop in Timoka in Central Europe as Ester is too unwell to travel, they ending up staying in a small suite in an otherwise virtually empty hotel. At this stage, Anna is tasked with taking care of Ester despite the two sisters having more than just a strained relationship. The sisters are also different in temperament, Ester, a translator of books, who is more focused on her brain, while Anna, largely uses her physicality (i.e. sex) to satisfy her needs. At the hotel, Anna ditches both Ester and Johan at whatever opportunity she can to satisfy her needs. Meanwhile, Ester continues to work whenever she feels well enough, while relying largely on the hotel steward working on that floor whenever she needs that assistance that Anna would have provided, and when she isn't self-medicating herself with alcohol. This situation between the sisters leaves Johan largely to his own devices, he who isn't told about how sick Ester really is, but who may be able to see the situation from his observer perspective.—Huggo When Bergman started shooting ""The Silence,"" he explained that it was the final installment of his film trilogy, which started with ""Through Glass Darkly,"" followed by ""Winter Light."" This trilogy corresponds to the start in a new direction taken by Ingmar Bergman: ""chamber films,"" so named for their analogy to chamber music. In ""The Silence,"" God has totally disappeared from the world. We are now faced with an absolute silence, resulting from a complete breakdown of communication between human beings.First Movement. After vacationing abroad, young Johan (Jorgen Lindstrom), his mother, Anna (Gunnel Lindblom), and his aunt Ester (Ingrid Thulin), are aboard a train, returning to their home in Sweden -- but we won't know these characters' names until about the middle of the film. The train whistle has just awakened Johan, who walks to the train compartment window. The atmosphere in the compartment is stiflingly hot. Anna, leaning against the back of the seat, perspiring and obviously uncomfortable, is fanning herself with a book. Ester, by contrast, is sitting upright, apparently unaffected by the heat. They are arriving in Timoka, a town in a country with a totally incomprehensible language. Johan asks Ester what a small sign on the window means, but even though she is an interpreter, she does not know the language. As she answers Johan, she has a paroxysm of coughing which stains her handkerchief with blood. Anna tries to help her, but Ester pushes her away and rushes from the compartment. A while later, Ester is back in her seat and condescends to accept Anna's help. Anna closes the door of the compartment, leaving Johan outside. Left to himself, Johan walks down the corridor, peeking into other compartments, and looking out through the windows. On a parallel track, a train of flatbed wagons passes, carrying tanks: obviously, there is a war or a revolution underway, or about to start.The train enters the station, brakes squealing and grinding. The next scene shows our three characters in a hotel room. Because of Ester's sickness, Anna and Ester have decided to stop for a time in Timoka, until Ester is better able to travel. The three take over two large rooms which communicate through a large doorway. Johan goes to the window to look at the street below, where feverish activities point toward a possibly imminent disaster. Anna decides to take a bath and asks Johan to come and scrub her back. Johan's obvious delight at being close to his mother is brief, as Anna cuts short this intimate moment and sends him back to the room to take a nap.Meanwhile, in the other room Ester is in bed, chain-smoking, drinking, and reading a book. As she has emptied her bottle, she rings the hotel floor porter (Hakan Jahnberd). The old man comes in, and Ester, not being able to communicate with him through the different languages she knows, manages through gestures to express her need for more alcohol. The porter returns with a bottle and leaves the room. Ester goes in her sister's room and contemplates Anna and Johan as they sleep. She returns to her own bed, unbuttons her pajamas and proceeds to masturbate. Suddenly, the deafening roar of airplanes fills the room, jolting Johan awake once more. He dresses, puts his cap-pistol in his belt and leaves the room, embarking on a lengthy exploration of the cheerless hotel's hallways. Johan first encounters a workman sitting on the top of a ladder, and shoots at him with the cap-pistol. Next, he hides behind an armchair and shoots at the old porter, who sits in his cubicle. When the old man makes a friendly gesture toward Johan, Johan runs away. Further down the hallway, he meets a dwarf whom he salutes. Coming into a turn of the hallway, Johan finds himself face to face with a reproduction of Ruben's Dejanira Abducted by Nessus. Meanwhile, Ester is in her bedroom on her hands and knees, spying through the doorway on her naked sister as Anna cools herself off with water from the sink.It should be noted that many of these scenes are in fact happening simultaneously, for example, the scenes of Johan studying the painting and Ester spying on her sister, indicating a parallelism in subject matter .Johan comes upon the open door of a room occupied by a group of dwarfs, part of a traveling Spanish troop. He goes in, but not before having ""shot"" three of them. They dress him up with a girl's dress, all the while speaking in Spanish, which although a more accessible language, is still foreign to Johan. The dwarf he had previously encountered in the hallway comes in and scolds his fellow dwarfs, and after taking the girl's dress off Johan, escorts him out. Johan manifests his frustration at being once more excluded by urinating in the hallway.In parallel with the previous scene, the meaning of Anna's lipstick, in a close-up shot, readying herself to go out, and its implication regarding Anna's state of mind cannot be missed. As she leaves, we see Ester's fury at having once more lost control over her sister. Anna wanders in a street crowded only with men. She enters a café and meets a young waiter (Birger Malmsten). She then goes to a variety theater where the group of dwarfs is performing. She sits in a loge where, next to her, a couple is having sex. She watches for a while, fascinated and at the same time, somewhat repulsed. She leaves the theater and returns to the café, where she communicates through a glance her immediate need to the young waiter.Johan is still walking the hotel halls. He sees the old porter having lunch in his cubicle. The porter persuades Johan to come and sit on his lap to look at old photographs. One photograph shows a family group with a young boy, probably the porter, standing around a coffin that contains a woman, who may be the porter's mother. At that moment, Anna walks down the hallway, and Johan runs to her and hugs her. Anna goes to her room but, anticipating a quarrel with her sister, stops Johan from following her. Johan, angered at being again rejected, resumes his walk along the hotel corridors. He slips the old man's photograph under a rug in a sign of protest over his latest dismissal.Anna is followed into her room by Ester who notices Anna's soiled dress, and understands what has happened during Anna's visit to the outside world. At this point, Anna demands that her sister stop her spying, and insists that she leave her alone.Second Movement. Later in the evening, Ester is in at the window in her own room, watching the strange evening activities below. She is listening to the radio, which is broadcasting one of Bach's Goldberg Variations. The porter, bringing in tea, recognizes the ""mooseek,"" and names the composer, ""Johan Sebastian Bach."". During this peaceful moment of understanding, Ester tells Anna that she and Johan should leave this same evening, and she will follow them at a later time, when she feels better. Anna refuses, not out of compassion for Ester, but probably because she has another rendezvous later that evening with the young waiter. Anna is about to leave the room when Ester turns off the uniting music and verbally attacks her. Once more, Anna sends Johan out of the room. Spitefully, Anna recounts her afternoon encounter with the young waiter in great detail to her sister. Ester is at once upset by these revelations, but also seems to enjoy them. Ester tries to dissuade Anna from going to meet her lover again, but to no avail.Anna meets the young waiter in the hotel hallway and they both enter an adjacent room. Johan listens for a while, his ear pressed against the door, and then wanders off down the corridors, lonely and disoriented. He returns to his room, goes to bed, and reads a little. Then, just as he enters his aunt's room, a prolonged rumbling brings him to the window, where he sees a tank parked in front of the hotel. Ester wakes and asks him to read something to her. Johan instead proposes to put on his Punch and Judy show. He proceeds with a violent puppet show, in which Punch beats Judy while speaking an incomprehensible tongue. Ester asks the meaning of this, and Johan replies that when Punch is afraid, he speaks this kind of funny language. Suddenly, Johan's pent-up emotions surface, and he rushes into his aunt's arms, sobbing. Outside the hotel, in a rumbling, the tank leaves the scene. Johan asks Ester to write few words of the strange local language she would have translated, which Ester promises to do.Meanwhile next door, after an amorous encounter, Anna and her boyfriend are ""talking."" That is, Anna is delivering a monologue of her inner thoughts, since they cannot otherwise verbally communicate. She hears Ester at the door sobbing, wanting to come in. Anna, still talking, opens the door and unloads all her repressed resentments on her sister. Ester leaves as the young waiter takes Anna once more.Third Movement. Some time later, in Ester's room, as Anna is leaving the room to go for breakfast with Johan, she tells her bed-ridden sister that she and Johan are leaving in the afternoon. An hour passes and Ester is lying in her bed. She is furious because Anna and Johan have not yet returned. She launches into an angry monologue that provokes a terrible spasm. The old porter does his best to help Ester in her distress. He realizes that she is dying, but he cannot communicate any words of comfort. The spasm subsides and Ester pulls a sheet over her face. She is lying under the sheets when Johan and Anna return. Johan is briefly afraid that Ester is dead, but she reassures him, and hands him the letter she wrote for him.In the next and final scene, Anna and Johan are together in a train compartment, on their way home to Sweden. Johan reads Ester's letter, titled ""To Johan: Words in a Foreign Language."" The film ends as it started, with an extreme close-up of Johan at the compartment window, muttering the few words written by his aunt."
When the Cat Comes,1963,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0056844/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Some people with a strange cat arrive in a small village. The cat wears glasses, and when someone takes them off, she can colour people, according to their nature and mood. The grown-ups of the village consider the cat to be dangerous, but the kids just love her...—Chris Makrozahopoulos <makzax@hotmail.com> Castellan Oliva (Jan Werich) watches the everyday life of his small sweet town from the gallery of a tower. From that height, he can afford to keep a tolerant view of the weaknesses and frailties of his fellow-citizen. Robert (Vlastimil Brodský), a young teacher, is preparing to marry his colleague Julie (Jirina Bohdalová). Robert invites Oliva to sit as a model in a drawing lesson. The old man tells the children about his life as a sailor and about his first encounter with Diana, the love of his life, and her magical tom-cat. All of a sudden, jolly music sounds from the square, heralding the arrival of a strange circus. To the surprise of both children and adults, there is a magician sitting on the roof of a red car who is almost indiscernible from Oliva, and a beautiful girl named Diana (Emília Vásáryová) with a tom-cat wearing sunglasses on her lap. At the close of that evening's performance by the magician, Diana takes the sunglasses off her tom-cat and people begin to change colour in front of his green eyes. The unfaithful turn yellow, the liars violet, the thieves and highwaymen grey and those who are in love turn red.—NFA.cz A small Czech town is turned upside down with the arrival of a magician, an acrobat and their magical, sunglasses-wearing cat Mogol. When the cat's sunglasses are removed, the true character and feelings of people are revealed. Lovers turn red, thieves turn gray, traitors turn yellow.—yusufpiskin Robert is a school teacher in an undisclosed Bohemian village. He is under stress from Charlie, the foreboding town mayor who controls the happenings in town and from his unfaithful and uncaring lover. Robert teaches the children a 'black and white' view on life and a realist view on art, stifling imagination.For an 'artistic' painting class, Oliva, a castellan (and storyteller) is invited as the subject. Instead of posing as a model, Oliva recounts a story of a cat with sunglasses - whose eyes revealed the true nature of the human condition through colour. Red, importantly, was the colour of 'lovers' - well-meaning people, whilst colours like yellow and purple were reserved for the unfaithful, envious and unruly. The 'normal' people eventually killed the cat, for they didn't want others to know who was good or bad.In the midst of a circus act coming to town, Robert's cat goes missing and he is led to Diana - an actress who is part of the performance. He meets the MC who bears a striking resemblance to Oliva and talks to Robert about his 'nature' - joshing Robert about his choice of 'normal' clothes.During the performance to the entire town, Oliva's tales of the cat come to fruition when the cat is revealed to everyone watching - and Diana takes off its sunglasses. The moment of everyone's colours being revealed drives the entire town insane, fighting over themselves. Robert, who's true nature is red, finds himself entranced with Diana - and the two embark on a romantic, idyllic outing.Whilst the cat is later found by children in the woods, the school servant snatches it and attempts for it to be killed - orchestrated by Charlie. Robert is tasked to teach children about a taxidermized Stork in front of Charlie, but moved by the cat's power, gives a moving passage to the children that they shouldn't have to study the dead animal. This angers Charlie and the superiors in the town, who attempt to frame Robert for killing the cat.At one point, the children go missing along with Robert, demanding they'll come back if the cat's safety is ensured. This sends the town amok, with families squabbling in the woods to find their lost loved ones. But, the children are no where to be found - not even Robert can find them, who tells them to come back. Eventually, the servant returns the cat and the children come out from hiding (with thanks to Oliva). When the crowd debates what to do with the cat, Diana and the circus act reappear to expose Charlie's true colors - a 'chameleon' of personalities, who is chased out of the town, reigniting the initial chaos in the town. When Robert tries to chase after Diana to accompany her, he is accosted by the frenzied crowd and loses her as the act travels out of town. Defeated, Robert walks alone back into the town square, only to be greeted by the children, who are holding art and paintings of the cat."
The Evil Eye,1963,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0057443/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A mystery novel-loving American tourist witnesses a murder in Rome, and soon finds herself and her suitor caught up in a series of killings. Nora is a young tourist traveling through Rome which takes a sudden turn when she witnesses a murder by a serial killer that the police have sought for years for the so-called Alphabet Killings, and Nora soon finds herself in way-over-her-head trouble when the police want her cooperation to catch the killer while the mystery killer soon targets her for his next victim.—Anonymous The American fan of mystery novels, Nora Davis, travels from New York to Rome to spend vacation with her mother's friend Ethel Windell Batocci. On board the airplane, she accepts a pack of cigarettes from the passenger on the next seat and in the airport she finds that the man is a drug dealer. When she arrives at Ethel's place, she meets Dr. Marcello Bassi and finds that the old lady is on her deathbed. During the night, Ethel has a heart attack and dies; Nora runs to the hospital to call Marcello. However, she is attacked and robbed on a staircase by a thief and faints. She awakens to witness a woman being stabbed, a man is after her. At the hospital, however, nobody believes her. At Ethel's funeral, a stranger (Laura Craven-Torrani) introduces herself as a friend of Ethel's and invites Nora to stay in her apartment while she travels to Switzerland to meet her husband. Nora accepts the invitation and decides to investigate the murder. She believes that the serial-killer of the so called Alphabet Murders is chasing her and she will be the next victim.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Nora Davis (Leticia Roman) is a young, sexually frustrated American woman who journeys to Rome, Italy to visit her elderly Aunt Edith. On the flight from New York to Rome, Nora is befriended by a young man sitting next to her on the plane who offers her a cigarette, and she accepts. He gives her his pack as a token of appreciation. Upon arrival at the airport, the man is arrested for smuggling drugs by custom officials who recognize him as a infamous drug smuggler.Upon arrival later that afternoon at her aunt's apartment, Nora is greeted by Dr. Marcello Bassi (John Saxon). Marcello tells Nora that her aunt is very ill and that she needs absolute quite and rest. After giving her instructions in case of an emergency, the doctor leaves. Nora is obviously smitten with him.Later that same night, as a violent thunderstorm rages, Nora checks on her aunt who suddenly dies of a heart attack. After trying to phone Marcello at his house in which there is no answer, Nora flees from her aunt's apartment. On the street, Nora is attacked by a sailor-dressed purse snatcher. In the ensuing struggle with the thief, Nora is knocked unconscious. A few hours later, she is awakened by a woman's scream. To her horror, Nora looks up to see a young woman collapsing to the ground a few yards from her with a knife in her back. She also sees a strange man crouching over the dead woman's body. Nora then faints.The next morning, the soaked and unconscious Nora is discovered by a passing stranger, who attempts to awaken her by giving her some whisky. Noticing a policeman approaching, the stranger flees. The policeman notices the unconscious Nora and successfully revives her. But upon smelling liquor on her breath, the policeman immediately thinks that she's a drunk sleeping off a binge. Ranting a raving about seeing a woman killed, Nora is shocked when she sees that there is no body anywhere. With no identification on her, Nora is locked away in a hospital's lunatic asylum where she is diagnosed by a doctor an intern residents as suffering from ""delirium tremors"". Nora is soon rescued by Marcello, who happens to notice her while on his rounds.After she is released from the hospital, Nora tries to tell Marcello about what she saw. But he is skeptical, thinking that it was an hallucination brought on by double shock of her aunt's death and the subsequent attack by the purse snatcher. Convinced that she witnessed a murder, Nora plots not to give up and find the murder victim and the killer.At her aunt's funeral, Nora meets with Laura Craven-Torrani (Valentina Cortese) who introduces herself as a friend of her aunt's and she takes Nora to her house for some coffee. As she is going out of the country to visit her husband for a few days, Laura asks Nora to stay and look after her house. Nora is initially reluctant, but accepts the offer.During her first night at the house, Nora discovers a collection of old newspaper clippings. Among the articles is a story about Laura's sister, who had been brutally killed. The murder took place in the same area where she herself was attacked. The article also states that the crime was the latest in a string of so-called 'Alphabet Killings' (the first victim's last name began with the letter 'A', and then the letter 'B', and so on). Nora meets with Marcello the next day to tell him of her find and comes to two theories: first since no body was found, Nora thinks that she had a psychic vision of the killing. She might not have seen an actual killing, but the killing of Laura's sister in her mind's eyes. Second: since the last victim was named Craven, she realizes that the next victim will be somebody whose last name starts with the letter 'D', and her surname is Davis. Marcello again skeptically assures Nora that shes fretting over nothing.Meanwhile, Nora begins to receive crank phone calls. Afraid that her life is in danger, she rigs a crude burglar alarm by setting up a web of strings all along the entrance to the house. That night a policeman, who has been asked by Laura to stop by to see if everything is all right, enters and is attacked by Marcello who has been standing guard outside. The ensuing scuffle ends with the love-struck doctor falling on the burglar trap and breaking his left forefinger.Seeking to distract her from her worries, Marcello takes Nora on a trip to the various tourist sites in Rome. At the end of their day, they return to the Craven house where Nora gets another phone call. The anonymous caller tells her to go to a particular address. That evening, Nora goes to the address, which is a run-down boarding house, and is guided to a vacant room by the sound of a voice. Without realizing it, Nora has been followed by Marcello, and when he suddenly reveals himself, she hurts him once again by scratches his face, thinking him to be the killer. Together, they discover the voice to be emanating from a tape recorder. It warns Nora to leave Rome before she meets the same fate as Laura's sister. Nora and Marcello investigate and discover that the room is leased to a man named Andrea Landini (Dante Di Paolo), whom Nora recognizes as the author of the newspaper article regarding the Alphabet Killer.After several unsuccessful attempts to locate Landini, Marcello and Nora go to the beach for relaxation. Marcello's desires finally erupt and he practically forces himself on Nora. But Nora stops him by telling him that although she is interested in him too, she encourages him to wait for a more appropriate time to consummate their relationship. Upon their arrival back at the Craven house, they are shocked to discover a stranger sitting in the living room. It is Andrea Landini, who had been informed that they were inquiring about him. Landini explains that he became obsessed with finding the Alphabet Killer, and that he collaborated with the police while writing a series of articles about the killings. When the police arrested and convicted a man whom Landini knew to be innocent, he kept on writing articles, using them as a opportunity to criticize the police for jumping to the wrong conclusions. He soon lost his job at the newspaper, but he continued to investigate the matter. Landini also explains that he was the one who tried to revived with her whisky, and he believes her to be the mostly likely target for the killer. Because of this, he has been following her ever since. Though Marcello is distrustful of him, Nora agrees to collaborate with Landini. Nora's teaming with Landini finds them venturing across Rome inquiring about the first two alphabet victims and of their connection to one another. But the results only lead to dead ends.The following day, Nora goes to meet with Landini at his apartment. She is perplexed to find that the apparent sounds of typing are actually emanating from Landinis tape recorder. When she finds a photo of herself labeled 'Fourth Victim', she becomes convinced that he is the killer. However, the matter seems to resolve itself when she finds Landinis body, an apparent suicide, with a note of confession by his side.That same day, Laura returns to Rome from her trip abroad. Nora and Marcello plan to go to America the following morning, and she agrees to spend one more night in the Craven house. Then Nora reads the daily newspaper where the body of a young woman was found, and she recognizes it as the murdered woman she saw that night. After identifying it at the morgue, Nora begins to realize that she may have indeed witnessed the killing after all.That night, when Laura is apparently out, Nora notices that the study door is open. Especially since Laura had earlier remarked on her husband instance that the room be locked at all times. Nora cannot resist the temptation to enter the room. In the study, Nora notices an adjoining door, and s sliver of light shining thought the bottom. Upon opening the door, she sees a man rising uncomfortably from his chair. Nora recognizes him as the same man standing over the dead body of the woman from that night. He then walks towards Nora, and collapses to the floor with a knife in his back. Nora attempts to flee, but is prevented by Laura. No longer acting like the good-natured woman as previously seen, the crazed and wild-eyed Laura confesses to the killings and explains that she just stabbed her husband because of his attempts to turn her over to the police. Laura reveals that the alphabet system is all a hoax meant to cover up the real motivation: the desire to steal her sister's money compelled her to murder. The trill of killing has apparently warped her mind, and Laura is now completely deranged. Before she can kill Nora, Laura is suddenly shot dead by her husband through the study door.In the final comic scene, Nora is happily reunited with Marcello. Marcello asks Nora for a cigarette, but after she gives him one, she is reminded of an important incident. The pack of cigarettes that Nora accepted on the plane to Italy in the opening scene were laced with a marijuana and cocaine combination. On the night of her aunt's death, Nora smoked a few of these cigarettes, and consequently she had interpreted the situation incorrectly. Though she witnessed an actual killing, her blurred memory confused the facts. The man she saw at the scene was Laura's husband, but he was not the killer. He was merely disposing of the body of the woman that Laura stabbed. When Nora comes to realize this, she takes the lighted cigarette away from Marcello and crushes it, saying that it's about time they both gave up smoking. She takes the pack of cigarettes and pitched it over the balcony where they are. The tainted pack of cigarettes are picked up by a passing priest who takes one out to light it up."

Hopelessly in love with his widowed and gloomily beautiful landlady, Mrs Margaret Hammond, Frank finds himself caught in the middle of his ferocious ambition and his unrequited love for the unattainable object of his desire, completely unable to break free from the agony of his bottled-up emotions. Now, all the riches of the world can't buy Frank happiness. What is the price the rough rugby player will have to pay for his success?—Nick Riganas Seeing the general adulation paid to the players even off the field, Yorkshire coal miner Frank Machin, through a series of actions, is able to secure an official tryout with his town's league rugby team. While his rough and largely ungentlemanly conduct on the field garners mixed reactions from those who will make the decision on whether he makes the team, he not only ends up making the team, but is able to negotiate a lucrative signing bonus, the money which he tries to use to make himself happy. His play generally does make him a fan favorite and a media darling in epitomizing pure masculinity. However, he is unable to impress the one person he really wants to impress, namely widowed working class Margaret Hammond. In having rented a room in her house for the past few months, Frank lives with Margaret and her two adolescent children, Lynda and Ian. She has shut down emotionally ever since her husband Eric died in an industrial accident, she still needing that connection to him in keeping and polishing his work boots which she keeps hidden in a cupboard. She is unaware of the rumor, probably which is reality and which Frank has heard, concerning Eric's death, it placing their strained relationship into context.—Huggo"
Winter Light,1963,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0057358/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A small-town priest struggles with his faith. On a cold winter's Sunday, the pastor of a small rural church (Tomas Ericsson) performs service for a tiny congregation; though he is suffering from a cold and a severe crisis of faith. After the service, he attempts to console a fisherman (Jonas Persson) who is tormented by anxiety, but Tomas can only speak about his own troubled relationship with God. A school teacher (Maerta Lundberg) offers Tomas her love as consolation for his loss of faith. But Tomas resists her love as desperately as she offers it to him. This is the second in Bergman's trilogy of films dealing with man's relationship with God.—<amanderik@aol.com> A widowed priest is troubled by lack of faith. The history centers around his relationship with a schoolteacher, who loves him but whom he can not love back and his bonds to a god he isn't sure he believes in. He tries to find a meaning with love and faith again, discussing his predicament both with those that has a lot of faith and those that might have lost it, in a cold winter landscape.—Mio In the cold winter in the countryside of Sweden, the pastor Tomas Ericsson is a bitter man living a crisis of lack of faith in God after the death of his beloved wife two years ago. After the mass, Karin Persson seeks out the pastor with her husband, the fisherman Jonas Persson, and tells that Jonas is tormented by an existential crisis when he learns that China has an atomic bomb and intends to commit suicide. Tomas unsuccessfully attempts to comfort Jonas but he is not convincing due to his lack of faith and Jonas kills himself with a shot of rifle in his head. Meanwhile, the schoolteacher Märta Lundberg is in love with Tomas, but the widowed pastor rejects her love with bitter and tough words. In the end, Tomas discusses with the sacristan the true suffering of Jesus Christ in the Passion of Christ.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Starring two great Swedish film actors Gunnar Björnstrand and Max Von Sydow (Beyond Dreams, The Exorcist). Bergman explores in this film the search for redemption in a world without meaning. Through the representation of a spiritual crisis he reflects on the human anxiety to validate himself in a world apparently abandoned by God. Tomas Ericsson, a priest who doubts the existence of God, runs a small congregation in which his members also question for and against God because of the response or silence he has maintained with them. Märta doubts its existence according to what Tomas preaches, but has received an answer to his prayers. Tomas, Karin and Jonas think that the silence of God is proof that it does not exist. During their reflections, they express their demons trying to find meaning in life in relation to their divine beliefs. Ingmar Bergman's ""Winter Light,"" also known by the more appropriate British title ""The Communicants,"" is the second installment in a film trilogy, preceded by ""Through a Glass Darkly"" and followed by ""The Silence."" This association was not intentional when Bergman made ""Winter Light."" Instead, the coda of ""Through a Glass Darkly,"" ""God is Love and Love is God,"" forms the nucleus from which he developed the central theme of ""Winter Light. "" The films of the trilogy are laid out like pieces of chamber music.First Movement. The film opens on a gray November Sunday, at noon. Pastor Tomas Ericsson (Gunnar Bjornstrand) is celebrating the liturgy of the Eucharist in a little church at Mittsunda. In the almost empty church, only seven parishioners are in attendance. Four of them are the usual attendees, and the other three are present with ulterior motives: the village school teacher and Eriskson's mistress, Marta Lundberg (Ingrid Thulin); the fisherman, Jonas Persson (Max von Sydow) and his pregnant wife Karin (Gunnel Lindblom). All three will communicate, together with the hunchback sexton of Frostnas, Algot Frovik (Allan Edwall), and an old woman from Hol (Elsa Ebbesen). Following the end of the service, flu-ridden Tomas returns to the vestry, where Mittsunda's sexton, Knut Aronsson (Kolbjorn Knudsen), is counting the meager collection. He advises the sickly Tomas to forgo the afternoon vespers service at the nearby village of. Frostnas. Tomas contemptuously refuses: he must dutifully keep his service to the parish. Frovik comes in to talk to Tomas about a personal problem, but Tomas dismisses him somewhat summarily, advising him to come to him later in the afternoon, before the vespers. Enter Mrs. Persson with her husband in tow, wanting to discuss a very urgent and private matter with the pastor. Jonas is silent and Karin must herself explain that her husband has been extremely depressed by a recent news article he read. According to the article, the Chinese, who are raised to hate, will soon possess the atomic bomb, thus intent in destroying everybody. Tomas is unable to connect with his parishioner's anguish and can only utter few platitudes: his ""we must trust in God,"" provokes Jonas' angry look, which Tomas cannot sustain, and forces him to lowers his eyes. The situation is so awkward that Mrs. Persson suggests that her husband drives her home, and returns immediately for a more private conversation with the pastor.As the Perssons leave, Marta enters the vestry, bringing Tomas a basket of food and coffee. He tells her he already has his own coffee. This is a typical ""Tomas"" reaction to Marta's attention: everything Marta does to near herself to Tomas seems to be wrong. They bicker briefly over her persistent harassment that Tomas should marry her. Before leaving, Marta asks him if he has read the letter she sent him the previous day, in which she explains herself, but to her chagrin, he has not.Second Movement. After Marta's departure, and with some hesitation, Tomas reads the letter in the interval before Persson's return to the vestry. Persson returns as promised [or does he?] At first, too afraid to address Jonas's philosophical issue, Tomas acts more like a social worker, asking Jonas mundane questions about his life. Realizing the superficiality of his approach, Tomas next launches into a long monologue in which he voices his own fears and doubts about God. It is obvious that Tomas's word cannot help Jonas, who leaves the vestry without uttering a word. Tomas rushes out to the chancel where Marta is waiting for him, and collapses in a coughing fit in front of the altar. At that moment, the old woman from Hol enters and says that Jonas has committed suicide with his own gun, by the river.Tomas, returning quickly to the reality of his clerical function, rushes to the site of the suicide, leaving Marta alone. The police are already present, and Tomas must simply stand by uselessly, as the body is taken away. Meanwhile, Marta has walked to the scene by the river. Together, they drive back to her schoolhouse, where Tomas accepts her help in the form of some aspirins and cough medicine. Marta climbs to the upstairs apartment to fetch the medicine, while Tomas waits downstairs in the classroom. A young student enters to retrieve some comic books from his desk. Tomas engages the boy in a light conversation. Marta returns, and she continues to discuss with Tomas their relationship. This is the climax of the film. The scene is without doubt the cruelest verbal assault in all of Bergman's films. Triggered by Marta's ""Sometime you sound as if you hated me,"" Tomas lets her have it, with both barrels blazing. Tomas's attack is so cruel that, as a spectator, one cannot feel but embarrassment at being somehow a reluctant witness to such an awful scene. The vicious arguments between Taylor and Burton in Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, or more relevant to Bergman, those between Ullmann and Josephson in Scenes from a Marriage, pale by comparison.Tomas nonetheless asks Marta if she would care to accompany him to the vespers at Frostnas. On the way, they are stopped at a train crossing. Tomas tells Marta of a terrifying childhood experience he had when he woke up frightened and could not find his father. They stop on their way at Mrs. Persson's house, so Tomas can bring her the news of her husband Jonas's death. Tomas and Marta continue on to Frostnas church.Third Movement. In the vestry, Frovik finally has the chance to explain his thoughts to Tomas about Christ's abandonment on the cross. At the same time, the organist, Fredrik Blom (Olof Thunberg), suggests to Marta she should leave Mittsunda and Tomas because the town is falling into despair, and because Tomas is still hopelessly in love with his dead wife. Blom says that people used to attend the church, but that Tomas's wife was Tomas's undoing.As there are no parishioners present for the service, Frovik comes in inquiring if the vesper should begin. Tomas tells him to go ahead regardless. As a result, the bells announcing the beginning of the ceremony are rung. Tomas emerges from the vestry, approaches the altar, and kneels. Frovik sits down in one of the rows. Marta stares toward Tomas as he rises and turns around to an empty congregation. He pronounces the final words of the film: ""Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of Hosts. The whole earth is full of His glory."" He ostensibly continues to officiate."

Under the Yum Yum Tree,1963,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0057622/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A love-struck landlord tries to convince a pretty tenant to dump her fiancé and give him a chance. Hogan owns and operates the Centaur Apartment complex. He rents the units to young women only at less than half their market value in order to spy on them lasciviously and seduce them. After Hogan's latest conquest, college professor Dr. Irene Wilson, moves out when their romance goes sour, Hogan is more than happy to rent that apartment to blonde college student Robin Austin, and even happier when he learns that she will have a slightly-taller brunette roommate. What Hogan doesn't initially know is that Robin is Irene's student and niece, and that Robin's roommate will be her boyfriend, fellow college student David Manning. Not wanting to mistake lust for love, Robin convinced a sexually-frustrated David, with whom she hasn't yet slept, to this platonic cohabitation arrangement just to see if they are truly compatible as people before they decide to get married. When Hogan finds out about David and the arrangement, he tries subversively to thwart any romance between Robin and David, all the while trying to get Robin for himself. Once Irene finds out about Robin and David's arrangement, she tries first to ensure that they stick to it and second that Hogan isn't trying any funny business with Robin, all in the name of protecting her niece. Irene, a professor of Education for Marriage, might be able to add some professional wisdom and firsthand knowledge of Hogan to keep the process moving.—Huggo College student Robin Austin decides that she and her boyfriend Dave Manning should share an apartment, platonically, to see if they are psychologically suited to each other. She learns that her Aunt Irene is moving out of her apartment so immediately swoops in to get the place. The lecherous owner-landlord, Hogan, immediately sets his eye on the innocent Robin and sets out to make her his next conquest. Hogan's first task is to make sure Dave doesn't get ahead of him and so gets him on an exercise regimen so as to thoroughly exhaust him. When Aunt Irene learns what's going on--she was one of Hogan's victims--she also learns that the Lothario had a long unbroken string of lovers living in that apartment. Dave plans his own counter-attack, however, leaving Robin in something of a daze. Aunt Irene comes to her rescue.—garykmcd A sexual predator who owns an apartment complex rents only to single young women so that he can peep at them between times when he's trying to get them into his red satin lair that's tricked out with wet bar, auto-mechanized sexy music, and a giant bed, a' la Rock Hudson in ""Pillow Talk."" But the joke's on the stalker, funny (creepy), Jack Lemmon, because he accidentally rents to a college student who wants to try out living with her fiancé for a trial run--chastely, of course. So it's high sexual tension three ways. In the end, virginal purity wins out and the young couple go off to be properly married, while the lecher landlord is landed by a previous tenant who thinks she loves him. (Every fun-time playboy deserves a good woman, it seems.) The good woman/previous tenant who had vacated the premises in an indignant huff when she realized he was a drooling Lothario came to the brink of de-spoilage, but all virtue remained intact in the end. And pre-feminism sensibility was given golden tribute as gender roles were merrily reaffirmed, ie the ladies do the women's work and the men the men's. Though Lemon has some funny pratfalls, Paul Lynde and Imogene Coca were this movie's only assets--too bad they didn't get more scene time."

Nicky, however, ends up with questions of his own about Ellen's faithfulness and love for him when he learns that Ellen was not all alone on that island but with a handsome man named Stephen Burkett, the two who pet nicknamed each other Adam and Eve. Nicky's questions about her faithfulness increase when she purposefully withholds information about Stephen from him.—Huggo Seven years to the day his wife Ellen disappeared in the sea after a plane crash, husband Nick Arden has her declared legally dead--and marries new bride Bianca. The same morning, Ellen returns home after being rescued by the Navy, and follows the pair to prevent them from consummating the marriage. Still in love with Ellen, Nick's delighted to see her, but finds breaking the news to Bianca impossible.—Jeremy Perkins {J-26} Early one morning in the District of Los Angeles Court of General Sessions, Nick Arden (James Garner) appears before Judge Bryson (Edgar Buchanan) so that he can have his wife Ellen Wagstaff Arden (Doris Day) declared legally dead. Five years earlier, Nick and Ellen, who had been married for three years, had been on a plane flying over the South Pacific when a storm caused the plane to crash. Nick and Ellen both made it to lifeboats after the crash, but Ellen was swept off the lifeboat that she was on and neither she nor her body were ever found despite an extensive search and was declared lost at sea. Having spent the last five years searching for Ellen, Nick, who has two daughters, Jenny (Pami Lee) and Didi (Leslie Farrell), has now decided that it's time for him to move on with his life, and part of the reason for having Ellen declared legally dead is so that he can marry a young woman named Bianca Steele (Polly Bergen) later on the same day. Nick plans for his new honeymoon to take Bianca to the same resort in Monterrey where he and Ellen spent their honeymoon.However, on the very same morning, the Navy drop Ellen, who is very much alive, off in Los Angeles, after they have rescued her from the island in the South Pacific where she has spent the previous five years since being swept off the lifeboat. Ellen requests that the Navy do not publicize her rescue or notify Nick about it, as she has plans to tell Nick about it herself. When she returns to her home, she meets Jenny and Didi, but they don't remember her, and she doesn't have the heart to tell them the truth. Her mother-in-law Grace Arden (Thelma Ritter), who is shocked when she sees Ellen, tells her that Nick had just married earlier that morning. Although Ellen is initially crestfallen upon hearing this news, when Grace adds that Nick's honeymoon has not yet started, meaning that his new marriage is unconsummated, it gives Ellen a sense of relief. As his true wife, as opposed to Bianca being his bride, Grace suggests that Ellen should go to the resort in Monterrey and tell Nick that she is alive.Ellen takes Grace's advice, and Nick is just as shocked as Grace was when he sees Ellen for the first time in five years as she confronts him. He is overjoyed at the idea of reuniting with Ellen and wants to stay with her, but Ellen will only agree if he tells Bianca the truth first. Nick returns to Bianca, who is angry and confused, and Ellen follows in order to eavesdrop on their conversation. Although Nick still loves Ellen and wants to be with her more than anything else, he also has to take Bianca's feelings into consideration, which makes him find it hard to tell the truth to Bianca, who is in an amorous mood normally expected of a new bride on a honeymoon. Ellen is irked by Nick's inability to tell Bianca, believing it to be a manifestation of Nick's love for Bianca over Ellen. In anger, Ellen leaves the hotel, but Nick sees her go, and decides to fake an injury in order to stop Bianca from making any more amorous advances.The next day, Nick returns home, where he is told that Ellen was not the only person to be stranded on the South Pacific island - there was also a handsome and athletic man named Stephen Burkett (Chuck Connors) there, and Ellen had given him the pet-nickname of ""Adam"", while Stephen had called her ""Eve"". Furious that Ellen mentioned nothing about Stephen, Nick confronts her, and she explains that Stephen is a nerd, and nothing happened between them for the whole five years they were together on the island.Ellen convinces an awkward-looking shoe clerk to pose as Stephen, but Nick is not convinced that the clerk is really Stephen and goes off on his own search for him. When Nick finds Stephen diving from a trampoline into a pool at the Beverly Hills Hotel, he is horrified to find out that Stephen is athletic, attractive and young. Nick invites Ellen to the hotel with the intention of making her confront Stephen. While they are together, Ellen comes clean with Nick about Stephen, though she still swears that nothing happened between them for their entire time on the island and asks Nick for his forgiveness.Nick briefly leaves Ellen after suggesting to her that they go somewhere else, and while she is alone, she notices Stephen. It leads to a confrontation from Ellen, but with Nick instead of Stephen. After she accuses Nick of setting her up with the intent to embarrass her, she storms out of the hotel and drives away. Nick jumps into a taxi to follow Ellen, who tries to evade his pursuit by hiding in a queue of cars at a car wash. The soap and water from the car wash make their way into her car through an open window, and when she tries to escape, she ends up dropping the convertible's top. Nick eventually finds Ellen after the wash is completed, but when he opens the car door, the force of the water that rushes out from inside knocks him to the floor.Back home, Nick finally brings himself to tell Bianca the truth about Ellen, but Grace has him arrested for bigamy as a way of forcing him to choose between Bianca and Ellen. It leads to another chaotic appearance in court with Nick, Bianca, Ellen and Stephen before Judge Bryson, the same judge who had earlier married Nick and Bianca but is now even more confused because he has four matters to deal with - the charge of bigamy against Nick, Bianca's request to annul her marriage to Nick, and two requests from Ellen, one to make her death certificate null and void, and the other to divorce from Nick. In the end, Bryson dismisses the charge of bigamy, grants Bianca's request to annul her marriage, declares Ellen alive again and postpones his judgment on the divorce proceedings between Ellen and Nick, before sending all of the parties away. Bianca leaves Nick outside the court, and Ellen, who is still legally married to Nick, storms out of the courthouse after rejecting an invitation to have lunch with Stephen.Ellen returns to her home and starts to search for Nick. Grace, who had expected Ellen to be back hours before, finds her and tells her that after she stormed out of the courtroom, Nick caught a taxi. Worried that she has messed things up, Ellen asks Grace about the children, and she replies that they have had to live without their mother for a long time, so she supposes that they could do without their father around the house. When Ellen asks Grace how she will speak to them, Grace tells her to march herself outside and tell them who she is.After taking off her coat, Ellen goes outside. She doesn't see anyone at first, but then Jenny and Didi reveal themselves to be swimming in the pool, and they both refer to Ellen as ""Mum"" or ""Mummy"". After Ellen looks back at Grace, who has followed her out, she hears another splash and sees that Nick is in the pool as well. Nick says to Ellen ""Well, isn't it about time somebody started kissing somebody around here?"" Ellen runs to Nick, and they hug each other, sending Nick falling backwards and pulling Ellen into the pool, where they kiss and play with the children."

Hard up and with a grudge against insurance companies, English pilot Rex Black fakes his death and meets up with his wife and the money in Malaga, Spain when things have quieted down. But when the insurance investigator turns up, Rex starts a game of cat-and-mouse.—Jeremy Perkins {J-26} Rex Black was the owner and operator of his own one plane air transport company based in Croydon, England. He died in a glider accident off the coast of England, his body was never recovered. In reality, he faked his own death in order for his wife, Stella Black, to collect on his life insurance policy. The Blacks orchestrated this scheme to get back at the Excelsior Insurance Company, which denied them insurance payment when Rex's plane crashed and burned, since his insurance policy expired by two days, either by Rex's error on forgetting a payment or having the mail delay the renewal payment. He figured the insurance company owes them for ruining their livelihood. Their plan, which evolves as it goes along, is for Stella to collect the moneys, Rex to assume another identity in Málaga, Spain, where the two will rendezvous, Stella to arrange for the money to be deposited and converted into draft form that they can access from anywhere in the world, and them to travel elsewhere where they can start their life anew. Stealing a passport of a tourist in Málaga, Rex assumes the identity of Jim Jerome, an Australian sheep farmer. But things change when Stella becomes more concerned about being with Rex, than ensuring their plan is foolproof, and Rex veers in the opposite direction, seemingly becoming fixated on the money, and being addicted to what he sees as easy money in defrauding insurance companies. These two issues become all the more important when Stephen Maddux, the Excelsior investigator working on Rex's policy claim, arrives in Málaga. Rex and Stella have to find out if he is on to them, if it is all coincidence, or if he is in Málaga for some other purpose. Rex and Stella will also have to decide how far they will go if indeed Stephen is tailing them to reclaim the insurance money.—Huggo In Croydon, England, seemingly grieving Stella Black (Lee Remick) has just returned home from her husband's funeral, he who died in a gliding accident when his rented glider crashed into the sea but his body was never recovered. In reality, she knows her husband Rex Black (Laurence Harvey) is still alive, he who has been in hiding at a seaside boarding house for the three months under the assumed name of Erskine, a shoe salesman on vacation, between the time of his ""death"" and the funeral. He has just clandestinely returned home following the funeral. They are perpetrating this ruse to collect on the £50,000 life insurance moneys from the Excelsior Insurance Company. They feel Excelsior owes them this money as, in the previous year, Excelsior did not pay out a £20,000 business insurance claim when his airplane, which he used to operate his own transport company, went down in bad weather on a flight to Hamburg, West Germany, and was destroyed. His insurance had lapsed by two days by his error in not paying the latest premium on time. Rex had the money and had never missed a payment.Rex at the house when Excelsior agent Stephen Maddux (Alan Bates) stops by unexpectedly to discuss details of the claim with Stella, most specifically confirmation from her that Rex's death was not a suicide.The next phase of the plan is for Rex to fly to Paris immediately. Stella, handling the finances, is to collect the insurance moneys, have it deposited in a bank account in Málaga, Spain, where she will be emigrating. She is then to take out a specific ad in The Daily Telegraph, which is code to advise Rex that all has been accomplished. Three days later, she is to fly to Málaga, where he will meet her.Rex accidentally acquires the passport of a drunken Jim Jerome, an Australian sheep farmer, and changes it to make it look as his own. Rex is now perpetrating the identity of Jerome, has grown a mustache, dyed his hair blond, and acquired an Australian accent, for his time in Málaga.Three days after placing the ad, Stella arrives in Málaga, and eventually meets up with Rex and his new group of international friends who only know him as sheep farmer Jim Jerome. They believe Stella is his casual widowed girlfriend, who he met while on a previous trip to London.At the bank, Rex and Stella go into the process of converting the insurance moneys into a bank draft which can be cashed anywhere in the world. This process will take one week.In the meantime, they are to pretend to be slowly moving into a more committed relationship, which Stella does not like if only because she feels the process is too slow, since she already has been without Rex for over three months, and is upset that Rex is staying with his international friends, which include some beautiful women. Stella also admits that she does not like ""Jim"" and by association what it looks Rex has become, a man doing anything for money, which he uses to buy a flashy new automobile, and expensive earrings for Stella. He also implies that he is in the process of another insurance scam where Jim Jerome has a bad heart and will die a premature death, which will allow them to collect further life insurance moneys.A British man who Stella recognizes but can't remember approaches her. He eventually divulges that he is Excelsior's agent, Stephen Maddux, and states he is in Málaga on vacation. He asks her out for dinner which she politely declines in a mild panic at his appearance. Stella and Rex later discuss the issue. Stella believes Stephen is a lonely man who just wanted company with someone he had previously met, albeit in less than pleasant circumstances, while Rex believes his arrival is too coincidental, and that he is looking for evidence as to their insurance fraud. After an argument, they agree to get away from Stephen by spending the week in a town down the coast until the bank draft is completed.Rex and Stella get settled in that small town, when Stephen arrives. Stephen notices Rex by the car he saw Stella previously drive. Rex does recognize who Stephen is until Stella arrives on the scene, she introduces Stephen to ""Jim Jerome"". Then, Rex believes a better tact to take, now that he knows Stephen knows that he and Stella are traveling together, is to keep Stephen close so that they can find out exactly how much he knows or suspects. If and when Stephen reveals that he knows too much, they will deal with him at that time in the appropriate manner. The immediate issue is for Stella to get another room, as they aren't supposed to be that close yet. Rex believes that in perpetrating only a casual relationship between the two of them, Stephen might be more willing to open up to her. Rex's plan places a further wedge between himself and Stella, who just wants to be with her husband.As Stella and Rex spend more time with Stephen this week, they find that he seems to ask a lot of questions about their lives, and that he secretly keeps writing things in a little notebook he carries around with him everywhere. Stephen takes a photograph of them, which Rex believes he wants as evidence and Rex then ""accidentally"" falls in the ocean with the camera.As Rex heads to Málaga one day to pick up the bank draft and to insure the earrings he bought Stella, he gives Stella the task of trying to get a look at Stephen's notebook. During their day together, Stella almost lets slip to Stephen that Rex and Jerome are indeed one and the same person. In turn, Stephen starts to tell her something - what she believes will be that he knows their ruse as he talks about her spending the insurance moneys and traveling aimlessly around the world - when she stops him. Seeing Stephen's room door ajar and knowing he is not inside, Stella sneaks in and tries to find his notebook. Stephen catching her in his room before she could read the notebook's contents, Stella implies that she was in his room to seduce him. They make love. After their lovemaking session, Stephen tells her among other things that he no longer works for the insurance company, and that what he writes in his notebook are musings about his travels, which he shows her. She now realizes that he knows nothing about their scam and that his interest in them is purely in her alone. She is so relieved that once again, with her guard down, she lets slip that Jerome is Rex, but she is able to cover up her mistake.When Rex returns from Málaga, he first runs into Stephen, who talks as if he knows what's going on with their scam without actually saying it. As such, Rex later tells Stella that their new plan, no more scams, is to ditch Stephen by leaving first thing in the morning before he awakens, and cross the border into Gibraltar. Relieved that there will be no more scams, Stella does not tell Rex what she has found out about Stephen.Catching Stella alone later that night, Stephen implies that he sees a future for the two of them. Stella responds in turn that he should not count on anything concerning her.The next morning, Stephen, awake and alone in his bed, finds one of Stella's expensive earrings in the bed.

On the surface however, Rex is cordial, telling Stephen to meet him and Stella for a drink further up the mountain.

Rex believes he is successful seeing Stephen's car go off the road. Stella is horrified. Two road workers witnessed the event, and are able to save Stephen, whose car, albeit in a precarious position, only slid a small distance down the hill.

Reaching the border, they are stopped behind a long line of cars. Once they reach border patrol, they are questioned. The telephone rings. It is the police, who have reached Stephen in the mountain. They alert border patrol to stop Rex and Stella. When Rex figures out what is going on, he notices that Stella has run off into the crowd with the bank draft. He jumps back into the car and drives off into the crowd chasing after Stella. Rex eventually catches up with Stella in a crowded church. Angry, he tries quietly to get the bank draft from her. She replies that he will never be able to cash the draft as the authorities everywhere will know he killed Stephen as Stephen has her insured earring his possession, the earring which she lost while in his bed. Incensed, Rex tries to strangle Stella out of jealousy. He is stopped when a policeman arrives. Rex runs off to his car and drives off while the police take Stella into custody. At the police station, Stella is surprised to see a still alive Stephen there. Stephen refuses to press charge against either Rex or Stella, Stephen still believing Rex's actions were purely out of jealousy. Stella continues the ruse as she tells Stephen that she told ""Jerome"" about their tryst.Meanwhile, Rex drives to an airfield and steals a plane. However, he is unaware of a leak in the fuel line.

The Courtship of Eddie's Father,1963,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0056956/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Eddie thinks it is time for his father to remarry. However, in his opinion his father's taste in women leaves much to be desired. He believes the girl next door would be a far better choice...—Timo Lamminjoki <lamminjo@pcu.helsinki.fi> Following the death of his wife Helen, Tom Corbett needs to adjust to a new bachelor life with his young son Eddie. Although they both dearly miss Helen, Tom and Eddie would like another woman to enter their lives as wife and mother. One woman already in their lives is Elizabeth Martin, a volunteer nurse, divorcée and Helen's best friend who lives next door. Tom and Elizabeth like each other as friends, as do Eddie and Elizabeth, but Tom and Elizabeth are constantly bickering and place walls up between each other in developing anything more serious. The first new woman to enter their lives does so for more pragmatic reasons - Tom hires a housekeeper, Mrs. Livingston, to tend to the domestic duties in the household. The second woman to enter their lives is Dolly Daily, a naive but attractive young woman from small town America who is in the big city solely to build up her self-confidence. Tom feels more protective toward Dolly than anything, and a business meeting Tom sets up between Dolly and Tom's womanizing colleague, Norman Jones, leads to a romance and ultimate marriage between the two. And the third woman to enter their lives is Rita Behrens, a chic fashion consultant. Tom and Rita immediately hit it off, but Eddie shows open disdain for Rita, solely because she has squinty eyes like all the ""bad"" girls in the comic books. Tom and Eddie have a falling out because of what Tom sees as Eddie's irrational dislike for Rita. After a courtship, Tom asks Rita to marry him, an act that sparks two responses. Noticing Eddie's disdain for her, Rita suggests they send him away during the beginning of the marriage just to give it a chance of success without the added pressure of Eddie's judgment. And Eddie runs away from Tom into the safe and caring arms of Elizabeth, who he would really like to see as his new mother. Both responses show Tom that marriage to Rita would not work, and that perhaps the walls he and Elizabeth have placed between themselves really are what need to come down for both the Corbett household and Elizabeth to be truly happy.—Huggo"

Postmaster Ostia ""Osh"" Popham (Burl Ives) helps them move into a run-down old house and fixes it up for them. It's not entirely uninhabited, though. The owner, a Mr. Tom Hamilton (Peter Brown), is a mysterious character away in Europe, but Osh assures them he won't mind their living there, since he won't be coming home for a long time yet. The children and a cousin who comes to live with them have various adventures before an unexpected visitor shows up. It's the early twentieth century. Upon the death of her well-bred husband, Margaret Carey (Dorothy McGuire) of Boston, Massachusetts is forced to sell many of the family's belongings and move into a smaller house, a dreary one which she has found in town, and only then will they barely be able to make ends meet on a much reduced budget. However, the eldest of her three children, teenager Nancy Carey (Hayley Mills), has made inquiries into the availability of ""the yellow house"" in Beulah, Maine, with which the family fell in love when they were there on a vacation a few years ago. The house at the time was empty, apparently still is, and is renting for a pittance according to Ostia ""Osh"" Popham (Burl Ives), the local mercantilist acting on behalf of the property owner, Tom Hamilton (Peter Brown). Mr. Hamilton inherited the house from his father, and now lives in China. Sight unseen, soft-hearted Osh rents them the house based on the ""tug at the heartstrings"" story Nancy told to him via their correspondence. Despite that story not totally being true, Osh falls in love with the Careys once they arrive in Beulah so as to keep to the verbal agreement. In fact, he offers them one concession after another, including that they can live there rent-free in lieu of the repairs and decorating they will do to make the house their own, with Osh even throwing in much of his own free labor. What Osh has failed to tell them is that not only has he not cleared any of these issues with Mr. Hamilton, but he hasn't even told Mr. Hamilton he has rented the house. The transition to country life has enough challenges for some of the Careys, which is made even more challenging with: the addition of an inherited old English sheepdog; the arrival of their cousin Julia Carey (Deborah Walley), a stuck-up young woman who the Carey children do not much like but who is not to be told of the unfortunate circumstances behind her needing to live with them; and Nancy just entering young womanhood, she who is as attracted to Charles Bryant (James Stacy), the dashing new schoolteacher, as any young woman in town.

America America,1963,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0056825/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A young Greek stops at nothing to secure a passage to America. Elia Kazan, ethnic Greek but Turkish by birth, tells the story of the struggles of his uncle - in this account named Stavros Topouzoglou - in emigrating to America. In the 1890's, the young, kind-hearted but naive Stavros lived in Anatolia, where the Greek and Armenian minorities were repressed by the majority Turks, this repression which often led to violence. Even Stavros being friends with an Armenian was frowned upon. As such, Stavros dreamed of a better life - specifically in America - where, as a result, he could make his parents proud by his grand accomplishments. Instead, his parents, with most of their money, sent Stavros to Constantinople to help fund the carpet shop owned by his first cousin once removed. What Stavros encountered on his journey, made on foot with a small donkey, made him question life in Anatolia even further. Once in Constantinople, his resolve to earn the 110 Turkish pound third class fare to the United States became stronger than ever. But try after try, his efforts were thwarted. But as he seemed close to achieving his dream, it seemed certain that it would snatched away from him. But an earlier good deed may have helped him ultimately achieve his goal of reaching the United States and a better life.—Huggo Stavros Topouzoglou is a young Greek man living in an area under Turkish oppression, who wants nothing more than to go to America. Stavros travels to Constantinople, enduring difficulties along the way that lead to the loss of all his family's funds. Rejecting any possibility for money, work or marriage that doesn't involve sailing to America, he defiantly hangs on to the dream, but his extreme determination may cost him his life.—Jwelch5742 Elia Kazan's own words begin the saga of young Stavros (Stathis Giallelis), who leaves his war-torn homeland behind to begin a new life in the land of the free. With his family's meager fortune and his father's blessing, Stavros encounters both allies and adversaries on a dramatic trek. He ultimately achieves his dream through sheer determination and will, thereby earning his nickname: America America. Saluting the masses who sailed toward Miss Liberty's shining torch, Kazan chose to use little-known talents here rather than stars; and the results were impressive, including Academy Award nominations for ""Best Picture,"" ""Director"" and ""Screenplay,"" and an Oscar win forGene Callahan's vivid Art Direction. Both epic and intimate, America America is powerful movie-making at its best. Stavros Topouzoglow, a young Greek living under the oppression of the Turks in the 1890s, dreams of emigrating to America as he faces the harsh reality that life has dealt him. Entrusted with his family's savings, he travels to the Turkish capital of Constantinople to rescue his cousin's failing business. Despite the cruelties, betrayals, and career setbacks Stavros faces along the way, he forms lasting friendships that help him through difficult times to reach his goal of making a life in The United States, the land of opportunity. Stavros Topouzoglou, a young Greek, decides to emigrate to America when one of his closest friends is murdered for standing up to Turkish oppression in 1896. As a preliminary step, he journeys to Constantinople in order to join his cousin Odysseus' rug business. His parents, Isaac and Vasso, planning to join their son later, entrust him with the Topouzoglou valuables; but Stavros is robbed on the way by Abdul, a dishonest Turk who previously befriended him. He later avenges the theft by killing Abdul but reaches his cousin's home penniless and disgraced. Odysseus advises Stavros to capitalize on his good looks by marrying a wealthy woman, but Stavros refuses to jeopardize his trip to America. Instead, he joins a group of revolutionaries and is seriously wounded during a raid. After a short affair with Vartuhi, one of the conspirator's daughters, Stavros reconsiders his cousin's suggestion and becomes engaged to Thomna Sinnikoglou, the homely daughter of a rug dealer. He finds that he cannot go through with the marriage, however, and accepts only a fraction of the large dowry offered by Thomna's father--just enough money for a boat trip to America. A day before the ship's departure, Stavros meets Sophia, the wife of American rug buyer Aratoon Kebabian. They have an affair aboard ship, but the romance is quickly aborted when the furious Aratoon discovers them and promises to have the young Greek deported to Turkey. Stavros hides from the authorities but realizes that the most important dream of his life will probably be shattered. His despair over the certain deportation has driven him near the point of nervous collapse when he meets Hohanness Gardashian, a young Armenian who is one of eight indentured shoeshine boys on his way to New York. Just as Stavros' chances for escape seem more remote than ever, Hohanness, who is dying of tuberculosis, jumps over the side of the ship and drowns himself, thereby permitting Stavros to use his name and take over the shoeshine job. The young Greek reaches America at last and begins saving money to bring his family to join him."
PT 109,1963,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0057393/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"PresidentJohn F. Kennedykept a unique inauguration gift on his desk: a plastic-encased coconut. The tale of that coconut is the heroic story of PT 109. Dramatization of President John F. Kennedy's WWII military experiences during which he commanded a PT boat that sank after being rammed by a Japanese destroyer while on patrol in the South Pacific on a very dark night. He and the other survivors, some of whom were wounded, made their way to a nearby island where they had to survive on meager rations and avoid capture by enemy forces till they could find a way to signal the Navy for rescue.—John Vogel <jlvogel@comcast.net> / Hans Delbruck When Lt. Jack Kennedy arrives in the South Pacific during World War II, he's keen to command his own PT boat. All he can find is a decrepit old cast-off, but he scrounges a crew together and the PT 109 is soon made seaworthy. Kennedy is an able commander who quickly gains the confidence and loyalty of his men. While on patrol on a dark and moonless night, the PT boat is cut in half after being struck by a Japanese destroyer. The survivors swim to nearby islands but are in enemy territory and in constant danger of being found out. Based on true events in the life of U.S. President John F. Kennedy.—garykmcd Solomon Islands, 1943. US forces are slowly pushing the Japanese out of the region. Short of larger warships, and suited to the shallow, narrow waters of the Solomons, the US Navy is heavily reliant on Patrol Torpedo (PT) boats to harry the enemy and perform all manner of other duties. One such boat is PT-109. Based on a (mostly) true story, here we see PT-109's exploits in the Solomons campaign, especially one incident for which it would become famous. The movie focuses on the exploits and derring-do of PT-109's commander, Lt (jg) John Fitzgerald Kennedy.—grantss Assigned to command a small, swift, PT boat in the South Pacific, a young Lieutenant Kennedy leads his men in a daring rescue of American Marines stranded on a small island inside the area of Japanese control. But on another mission, a Japanese destroyer slices the small boat in half. Now, miles from the nearest island Kennedy proves himself a hero with his efforts to save the crew of PT 109. In the spring of 1943, Lt. (j.g.) John F. Kennedy (Cliff Robertson) requests assignment to the PT boat base at Tulagi in the Solomon Islands. Amid scheming yeomen and Japanese air raids, he makes the acquaintance of Commander C.R. Ritchie (James Gregory), the crusty senior maintenance officer, before meeting his new commanding officer, Lt. Alvin Cluster (Grant Williams). Insisting on skippering a PT boat, Kennedy accepts command of PT 109, a battle-scarred, crewless mess of a boat moored beneath camouflaged netting. Ritchie gives him exactly one week to whip his new boat into shape; with his new executive officer, Ensign Leonard Thom (Ty Hardin) and a crew of nine enlisted men, Kennedy sets out to work a miracle.Within the given week, PT 109 meets Ritchie's tough standards of readiness and is sent out on trial maneuvers. Kennedy and his crew learn the hard way that being last to return to base means being stuck at the refueling pier for several hours; meanwhile, his engineers warn him of the consequences of reversing his engines at high speed. While awaiting refueling, Kennedy and Thom learn that the nearby island of Rendova has been invaded by Allied forces and is to be the future site of a new base. Refueling still has not been completed when Cluster sends PT 109 on an emergency rescue mission to cover an evacuation of Marines from Choiseul. Laying down cover fire, Kennedy and his men come to the rescue of a platoon of Marines when their evacuation craft is hit by a grenade. As they move out of range of the Japanese forces, PT 109 runs out of fuel; the incoming tide very nearly pulls it back within range of enemy guns before another PT boat arrives with a tow line.Three of Kennedy's crew have been wounded and are replaced, shortly before the squadron is transferred to the completed base at Rendova. Although Ritchie is initially ordered to stay behind at Tulagi, he has it out with the flotilla commander and arranges his transfer to Rendova with the crew of PT 109. En route, the boat is attacked by a Japanese fighter plane. Standing by the 20-mm machine gun astern, Ritchie prevails upon the gunner to let him take a shot - and successfully splashes the attacking plane.Upon arrival at Rendova, Kennedy orders one high-speed reversal too many. The engines fail, sending the boat crashing into a maintenance shed at the end of the pier; Ritchie vehemently chews Kennedy out, but more important matters - including a protracted air raid by Japanese bombers - take precedence. During the raid, Kennedy runs into an old friend, George ""Barney"" Ross (Robert Culp). In excess of a duty station, Ross is allowed to join PT 109 to man a 37-mm anti-tank gun Kennedy has attached to the foredeck. Thereafter, PT 109 is sent out on a late-night patrol with the squadron to intercept the ""Tokyo Express"" before it can reach Guadalcanal. During transit, Kennedy has a word with his torpedoman, Andrew Kirksey, who has a terrible foreboding that he will be killed before PT 109 returns to base.The darkness of Blackett Strait is impenetrable; none of the crew are aware that a Japanese destroyer is bearing down on PT 109 until it appears out of nowhere, ramming the boat amidships and cutting it in half. Several of the crew are thrown overboard; many are severely burnt and wounded. Kennedy and the unhurt members of the crew swim among flaming wreckage and burning fuel oil to rescue the survivors as PT 109's foredeck barely remains afloat. Kirksey and a machinist's mate, Harold Marney, are never found.The next morning, the survivors cling to the remains of PT 109 as Kennedy makes the daring decision to swim for the nearest uninhabited island. Not a minute after the crew abandons ship, the foredeck capsizes, leaving Kennedy and his men to swim three and a half miles to dry land. Upon reaching the island, they narrowly avoid being detected by a Japanese patrol barge, but also fail to attract the attention of an overflying American reconnaissance plane. Many of the crew believe that they have been given up for dead, but Kennedy refuses to despair. Over the course of two nights, he and Ross swim out into open water in the hopes of flagging down a friendly patrol, but luck is not on their side.Hope for survivors also dwindles among the command staff at Rendova, but unfazed, Kennedy leads his crew on another swim to the island of Olasana. While there, two native Solomon Islanders discover the Americans. Though they speak no English, Kennedy carves a message on a green coconut and asks them to take it to Rendova. The next day, another native canoe - bearing a message from Reginald Evans, a nearby Australian coastwatcher - arrives to take Kennedy to meet Evans. Despite the risky passage, Kennedy makes contact with Evans, who has radioed Rendova with news of the survivors. Kennedy then rendezvouses with PT 157 at Paporan Island and pilots it to Olasana, where his crew, still hidden in the bushes, straggle out to their salvation.Though they are all entitled to a month of survivor leave stateside, Kennedy declines his own leave, feeling that he still has a job to do. He takes command of PT 59, a converted gunboat, and continues in his duties with five former PT 109 crew members at his side."

The old and wealthy Mr. Enderby (Finlay Currie) dies of a heart attack but the ever suspicious Miss Jane Marple (DameMargaret Rutherford) has her doubts. Who or what gave him a heart attack? Enderby's poor relatives gather at the The Gallop, a combined boarding-house and riding school. Miss Jane Marple also gets there to find out if any of them had any particular reasons to see him dead.—Mattias Thuresson When Miss Jane Marple (DameMargaret Rutherford) and Mr. Stringer (Stringer Davis) are soliciting for their charity that benefits paroled convicts, they call on the home of wealthy Mr. Enderby (Finlay Currie). They are shocked to witness his heart failure culminating in his fall down the stairs to his death. Miss Jane Marple suspects that he was ""frightened him to death"" intentionally by a cat, but she cannot interest Inspector Craddock (Charles 'Bud' Tingwell) in her theory. She surmises that one of Enderby's four heirs is guilty of his murder, and her theory seems to be confirmed when two of them end up murdered.—duke1029 Miss Jane Marple (DameMargaret Rutherford) investigates the sudden death of old Mr. Enderby (Finlay Currie), who died of a heart attack but was literally frightened to death by a cat. The man's fear of felines was well-known and Miss Jane Marple is convinced that his deadly encounter was planned, making his death a murder. Unable to convince Inspector Craddock (Charles 'Bud' Tingwell) that a crime has taken place, she decides to investigate. With the assistance of Mr. Stringer (Stringer Davis), she focuses on the four relatives who inherit Enderby's fortune and gathers every bit of gossip she can about them. When one of the four is found dead, she heads off to the Gallop Hotel, owned by old Enderby's nephew Hector Enderby (Robert Morley), and where the remaining guests are staying. When another of the relatives is killed, the field of suspects seems to narrow even more, but Miss Jane Marple has to plan a clever ruse for the killer to come out into the open.—garykmcd Miss Jane Marple (DameMargaret Rutherford) and Mr. Stringer (Stringer Davis) are collecting money for The Reformed Criminals Assistance League, and Miss Marple decides to pay a visit to the stingy Old Enderby (Finlay Currie). They go to his manor and witness him dying, frightened to death by a cat. Miss Marple snoops around the house and finds a piece of mud that she keeps with her. She calls the Police and later she reports to Inspector Craddock (Charles 'Bud' Tingwell) that Old Enderly was murdered. However, he tells her that the Death Certificate states his cause of death as heart failure, and Old Enderby had a severe heart condition for many years. Miss Marple decides to investigate one of the heirs, but she finds her dead in her house with her housemaid Miss Milchrest (DameFlora Robson). Then she lodges in The Gallop Hotel to investigate who might be the murderer. When her prime suspect is killed, she finds the reason why the assassin is killing the relatives of Old Enderby. Now Miss Marple plots a scheme to catch the killer.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Our story opens in Miss Marples village of Milchester where she and Mr. Stringer are going door-to-door collecting donations for The Reformed Criminals Assistance League with mixed success. As they approach the large gates of an estate on the edge of town, we see a horseman riding rapidly from the scene, but they don't observe this as Mr. Stringer is trying to talk Miss Marple from soliciting from Mr. Enderby as they have never had success in the past. They proceed, however, and find the door to the mansion ajar. Entering the home they observe Mr. Enderby clutch his chest and fall down the stairs, dead. He has been frightened to death by a cat, of which he was notoriously terrified. Miss Marple picks up a clump of mud from a riding boot; this must belong to the murderer.Chief Inspector Craddock encounters Miss Marple at the police station. He rejects the idea of murder and Miss Marple leaves to do her own investigation.At her cottage she and Mr. Springer bake the mud and make a plaster cast of it. She wonders who benefits financially from Mr. Enderby's death and later she and Mr. Stringer climb up to a window outside the solicitor's office so she can observe the reading of the will. The proceeds are divided equally among Mr. Enderby's 4th cousin George Crossfield, an art dealer, a young attractive woman Rosamund Shane and her husband Michael, his nephew Hector (Robert Morley), and his sister, Cora Lansquenet, who has been long out of the country and is unknown to the village, and is veiled. Cora says that she is sure Mr. Enderby was murdered. CI Craddock happens by and runs off Miss Marple and Mr. Springer.Back at the cottage, battle plans are drawn and the two sleuths scour the village for gossip. Returning to the cottage a decision is made to visit Cora Lansquenet at the house she has rented. There, Miss Marple finds Cora stabbed to death with a hat pin. We are introduced here to Miss Milchrest, Cora's assistant who at first thinks Miss Marple has done the murder. The police are called and Miss Marple gets to do her ""I told you so"" routine with inspector Craddock. Learning that the rest of the family members are staying at ""The Gallop"" Hotel which is owned by nephew Hector, Miss Marple arranges for a stay there.At the hotel, which is a rural riding establishment, Miss Marple checks in while Chief Inspector Craddock and Sergeant Bacon are beginning their interviews and at the same time Miss Milchester arrives and asks for a room to stay in for a few days.It turns out that Miss Marple was a champion rider in her youth and Hector is a great admirer but didn't know he had been living near her all these years. He is excited to have her as a guest. They go off for a ride together where Hector is thrown from his horse and injures his foot.We have a scene where Rosamund meets Crossfield in her room. We learn that he needs money and that he has long desired to be with Rosamund. She is presented as hardened and cynical. The Shanes go for an automobile ride. It is their car which startled Hector's horse Black Jack and caused him to be thrown. We learn that Shane also needed money and lied to the Chief Inspector about his whereabouts on the day of the Enderby murder because he had been at the house to ask for money.All the while during her stay, Miss Marple is checking boots for a match with her plaster cast. She comes into conflict with Hillman the hired hand who is rude to her.That night someone tries to kill her by turning on the gas in her room, but she wakes up and turns it off without suspecting anything. She goes out to the tack room where she can check several boots at once.Inside the main building there is a large argument going on in Hector's office. Rosamund and Mr. Crossfield both want a certain painting owned by their Aunt Cora. Hector decides the issue by stating emphatically that *he* is taking it.That night, Miss Marple checks Crossfield's boots which he left in the hallway and they are a match so she thinks she has found the murder. Outside, she overhears Crossfield in his room arguing with someone who can't be seen. Crossfield then goes outside. In the stables the argument continues and the still unknown party locks Crossfield in Black Jack's stall where he is trampled to death. When CI Craddock comes out for the investigation Miss Marple admits she had thought she had discovered the murderer but was mistaken and now wants to set a trap for the real one.The next day is spent by Craddock and Bacon doing their interviews. Miss Marple has stolen the painting and sends it with Mr. Stringer to London for an appraisal. She advises Craddock that she plans a stunt at the annual ball being held that night.At the dance, which is a lively success, Mr. Stringer arrives and says the painting is worth at least 50,000 pounds. They dance the twist and Miss Marple fakes a heart attack. The police surgeon is called and says that any shock to Miss Marple would almost certainly kill her. She is placed in an isolated room on the first floor, as planned. Craddock and Bacon stand guard outside the window.Later, Miss Milchrest comes in to check on Miss Marple and then leaves. Later still, a ghostly figure enters the room in an attempt to scare Miss Marple. It is Miss Milchrest wearing a veil but Miss Marple isn't frightened. Here, Miss Milchrest reveals everything. She knew she was going to inherit the painting and cooked up a scheme to kill Cora Lansquenet to get it. She had to kill Mr. Enderby first however to throw suspicion onto someone else. George Crossfield had been to see Enderby just before the murder, but it was just to ask to borrow money.Miss Milchrest attempts to stab Miss Marple but she fights her off, (while accidentally destroying the painting) and Craddock and Bacon rush in to save the day.The next morning Hector Enderby asks Miss Marple to marry him. She declines and also mentions she is against blood sports. Hector is appalled to hear that and is glad for a close escape."

Under spell he tries to kill the judge, fails and dies. Upon losing its victim, Horla has no choice but to select a new one, the judge.—vlady@worldnet.att.net DIARY OF A MADMAN aka THE HORLAThe film begins with this quote: the vulture has eaten the pigeon; the wolf has eaten the lamb; the lion has devoured the sharp-tongued buffalo; man has killed the lion with an arrow, with a spear, with gunpowder; but the HORLA will make of man what man has made of the horse and of the ox; his chattel, his slave and his food by the mere power of his will. Woe to us!Guy de Maupassant.A graveside service is being held for Magistrate Simon Cordier (Vincent Price). After it is over, each member of the assembled pitches in a bit of dirt. Andre DArville (Edward Colmans) tells Police Captain Robert Rennedon (Stephen Roberts) that the deceased gave a wish for those involved to meet after the funeral. He tells him that they are willing to do so. Jeanne DArville (Elaine Devry) expresses her disgust for Cordier but agrees to meet.At the Galerie DArville Andre takes charge of the meeting, citing that Cordier gave the house to the DArvilles, even though they were known for disliking him. A letter is produced, said to be written by Cordier to be read after his passing. It states that in the event of his death that night, the chest was not to be opened except after the funeral. Father Raymonde (Lewis Martin) wonders why Cordier would think he might die that night. Capt. Rennedon tells him that his investigation proves it was not accidental.Inside the chest is a diary belonging to Cordier and a letter explaining why he could not tell what he is telling now after his death. His servants Pierre (Ian Wolfe) and Louise (Mary Adams) state that they knew nothing about this or about a diary. Rennedon is impatient for the diary to be read.[FROM THE DIARY] Beginning on the day of the execution of Louis Girot (Harvey Stephens), Rennedon visits Cordier in his office. He informs Cordier that Girot wants to see him in his cell. They both leave to go to the jail.Girot claims that an evil force within him caused him to kill his victims. Cordier doesnt believe any of it. Girot tells him that he wants to die to be free of the possession. His eyes glowing green, he attacks Cordier, but falls to his death. Rennedon has the cell opened and has the guard go for a doctor.At his residence, Cordier asks Pierre to bring a cognac into the study. Entering the study, he admires his caged bird who sings. Suddenly he is shocked to see a framed photograph of his late wife and child on the wall. He pulls the servant cord and asks Pierre how the picture got back onto the wall. Pierre swears that no one has been in the house except himself and Louise and that they didnt have anything to do with this. Cordier returns the photo to the chest in his attic and notices written in the dust on the front of a bust of his late wife the words  Hatred is Evil.  Pierre enters and Cordier tells him about the writing, which has disappeared when they look for it.Pierre and Louise discuss what the matter with Cordier might be. They are puzzled.In the study, Cordier sips his cognac and asks Pierre whether or not Cordier ever sleepwalks. Pierre replies that he doesnt know since his quarters are in another part of the house. Cordier speculates that maybe memories of his late wife and child have returned to cause these things.The next morning in his office, Cordier asks his assistant Martin (Dick Wilson) to bring him a certain file. On his desk, Cordier is surprised to see the file of Girot. He questions Martin about it. Martin says the office was locked and suggests that maybe Cordier left it there the night before.Looking at the Girot testimony from the trial, Cordier asks Martin to summon the building superintendant to see if anyone could have moved the file. When he turns back to his desk, a bottle of ink has spilled, ruining the testimony papers. As he blots the ink, a mans laughter is heard. Cordier asks if someone is there. He sits down and hears more laughter, followed by a voice (the Horla) (Joseph Ruskin) telling him that since Girot is dead he wont be needing the testimony. He also hears that since Girot is dead that the voice will inhabit the body of Cordier. There is a gust of wind and the French doors close.When Cordier tries to hold court, he is unable to focus and has to postpone court proceedings. Back in his office, he writes in his diary about the impending fear of oncoming madness. The voice is heard again, telling him that their association has just begun. Cordiers eyes are shown with the green tint. He is told to rise and kill the bird. When he comes back to himself, he looks for the bird and finds it dead on the floor.Visiting Dr. Borman (Nelson Olmsted), Cordier confesses to hearing the voice and being unable to resist what he is told to do. Borman tells him that it is all in his mind and that he should change his lifebecome a sculptor againsomething he did when he was younger. Borman says that science doesnt believe in ghosts and spirits and that only Cordier can cure himself.Out on the street, Cordier sees a painting of a woman by Paul Duclasse (Chris Warfield) and is immediately approached by the subject, Odette Malotte (Nancy Kovack), who suggests he sculpt her. He agrees and gives her his card.Odette goes into the gallery and asks Andre and Jeanne how the sales are going. She is told that Paul is a new artist and it takes time for popularity to grow. Odette tells Jeanne that they both have Pauls interests at heart. Jeanne is very uncomfortable with this personal insinuation and tells Odette that Paul is in the office. Odette goes upstairs.In the office, Odette speaks to her husband, Paul, who tells her one painting sold for thirty francs, which she scoffs at. She tells him she has a job as a model, posing for ten francs an hour. She convinces him that they need the money and that she will return with a bottle of wine to celebrate.That night Odette knocks on the door and Pierre answers. He invites her and tells her he will inform Cordier that she has arrived. Cordier greets her and takes her upstairs to the studio. Pierre and Louise watch and comment on how long it has been since a woman came to the house.In the attic (which has been cleaned up to be a studio) Odette poses on a chair and Cordier suggests she achieve a look of gaiety. She lowers her dress below her shoulders and releases her hair. Cordier likes the pose and begins sketching.Next we hear Cordiers voice explaining that time passes quickly and that the voices are not heard during this period. He presents the bust as completed and they look at it. She remarks how he kept a bust of his late wife up in the attic. He tells her that she died by suicide and was not buried in the churchyard. He suggests that he might want to do a full sculpture of her and that he will contact her at that time.The Horla speaks after she leaves, telling Cordier that his reflection in the mirror is blocked by the body of the Horla. Cordier throws a case of artists tools at the mirror but still sees no reflection. Only when the Horla steps aside does Cordier see his own reflection. He is told that he is a murderer and that that evil drew the Horla to him forever. It is said that he drove his wife to suicide, blaming her for the death of his son. He denies this. The Horla tells him that Odette was not who she seemed to be. As he is directed to look at the clay sculpture, he sees it change to an evil expression. The Horla leaves by a window. Calling Pierre upstairs, Cordier gets him to witness that the sculpture has changed.Lying in his bed later, Cordier sees the French doors open and the Horla enters. He is told to pursue the woman and pretend there is love. He refuses but the Horla insists that he will force him to do what he says.Pierre and Louise are seen looking at the portrait of Odette, which now hangs in the spot where Cordiers late wife was displayed. The carriage arrives and Cordier escorts Odette into the house. He tells Pierre to tell Louise to prepare the finest dinner and wine from 1881.In the study, Odette sees the portrait and admires it. Cordier confesses his love and suggests that they will begin seeing each other. He proposes marriage and she confesses that it was she who was enamored with him during the sessions. He puts a cameo around her neck, telling her that it once belonged to his wife. She seems impressed.Paul is seen talking to Jeanne (who is also interested in Paul) about his troubles with his wife Odette. He tells her that Odette is no longer interested in him and has moved out into a new apartment. He shows Jeanne a card from Cordier, which Odette had given him. When she left, she told Paul that Cordier could give her all the things she always wanted and Paul could never give. He reminds Jeanne that they are still married.Cordier toasts Odette and tells her that they will honeymoon in his house in Lucerne. She tells him she has one thing she needs to take care of before announcing the wedding. Pierre comes and tells Cordier that he has a visitor: Paul. When she hears Pauls name, she turns away. Cordier asks what Paul means to her and she admits they are married.Paul is invited into the study, where he immediately sees the painting. Cordier tells him he is a great admirer of Odette. Paul remarks how Odette is his wife and he wants Cordier to leave her alone. Cordier tells him that he loves Odette and that nothing will prevent them from marrying. Paul suggests that the public would be surprised to know about their affair and leaves.Immediately the Horla tells Cordier to kill Paul. He refuses. As Paul nears the front door, a large vase falls, nearly hitting him. Cordier comes and apologizes for the accident. Pierre and Louise look on. Paul remarks that it would have been a convenient accident and leaves. Cordier tells Pierre to clean it up in the morning.In the study, the Horla tells Cordier that the time for killing is not yet. This was done to show how simple killing can be. Cordier argues that he will never kill a human as long as there is a shred of his own will left in him. The Horla leaves and Cordier remembers Odette is waiting outside. He tells her that they must leave right away for Lucerne and gets her promise to come with him.Packing his suitcase, he notices the lamp being turned down. He addresses the Horla, who tells him that he cannot run away from it. Cordier is told to kill Odette. He refuses, but the Horla shows by killing a rose that it is able to manipulate him into doing anything. Cordier fires two shots from his derringer to no avail. He speculates that the Horla must be limited as humans are. The Horla tells him that even a distance away he will be able to kill Paul. Later that night Cordier takes a walk over to Odettes place.Paul shows up at Odettes apartment and beats on the door. She reluctantly lets him in. Seeing the suitcase, he says that she is going away with Cordier. He angrily knocks the suitcase over onto the floor. He tells her that she will bleed the Magistrate dry and then go on to another rich man. She agrees and Paul says he is a fool and that Cordier is a bigger fool. He leaves and Cordier approaches from the shadows.Odette opens the door and is surprised to see Cordier. His facial expression is one of evil. She notices and becomes alarmed. He pulls out a knife and stabs her repeatedly. Returning home to his study, we see the green light go out of his eyes.The next morning Marcel the Postman (Don Brodie) delivers the mail to Cordier, who tells him to forward all mail to Lucerne. A spot of blood is seen on the stairs. Looking at the newspaper, he sees that Odette has been murdered and decapitated. The trail of blood drops goes upstairs. He follows the trail to his studio in the attic. Looking at the sculpture, he pulls away clay from one side to reveal Odettes head beneath.The Horla comes in, telling Cordier that he left last night and killed Odette. He denies this, saying he never left the house. The Horla reminds him that Girot never thought he murdered anyone either.Jeanne goes to the gallery, weeping and telling Andre that Paul has been arrested for the murder of Odette. A witness remembers Paul arguing with Odette that night. Andre promises they will pay for a defense attorney.Cordier speaks to the bust of his late wife, wishing he could bring her back from the dead. Suddenly the Horla bursts in, telling him that he is talking only to his conscience. Cordier insists that his heart is in communication with Helen. The Horla laughs and smashes the sculpture of his late wife. He then tells Cordier to wrap Odettes head in a blue towel and take it to the grave. Directed to the back of his garden, he finds a hole dug in which he places the head. The Horla fills in the dirt, telling him that once the body is buried all traces of the woman will have been removed from his life. He tells Cordier that Paul will die for the murder because he is in control of his life.The Horla tells Cordier to burn the painting and finally gets him to place it in the fire. Capt. Rennedon knocks at the door. The Horla tells Cordier to tell him only what he wants. Rennedon is escorted into the study. He tells Cordier that Paul wants to speak to him. After mentioning how Cordier is a man of justice, Rennedon agrees to bring Paul to the Magistrates chambers the next day at noon.Paul is brought into Cordiers chambers with Rennedon present. Cordier states that he doesnt know Paul and that he didnt know his wife. Paul angrily accuses him of wanting to marry Odette. Cordier tells Paul as the guards lead him away that this stunt will not affect the court into believing that he is insane.Paul and Jeanne discuss what happened. He is surprised that Cordier can deny even knowing Odette. Jeanne tells him that Cordier would not let an innocent man be executed just to save his own reputation. Paul remarks how totally cold and inhuman Cordier seemed and how he showed no grief for the death of Odette. He thanks Jeanne and her father for their help. She tells him they dont want to lose him. He kisses her and says he wanted to when they were children. She kisses him again. He says there must be some way to prove that Cordier knew Odette.Cordier writes in his diary that he is scheduled to preside over the trial of Paul. He cannot in good conscience send an innocent man to the guillotine. He plans suicide and loads his gun. The Horla comes in and takes away the gun. When Cordier tries to retrieve it, the Horla pushes it away. He says he wont allow Cordier to kill himself. There is a knock on the door and Cordier is told to answer it.Jeanne tells Cordier that he bought a painting from her at her fathers gallery. He seems not to remember but invites her in. She insists that she has a good memory and asks why he lied about knowing Odette and Paul. She asks for the servants, saying they know Odette was in the house. He tells her they are in Switzerland. She threatens to tell the police, who will be interested in questioning them.After Jeanne leaves, the Horla tells Cordier that he must kill her. He refuses, but his eyes are seen green-tinted.Jeanne discusses her plans with Andre, who advises her not to accuse the magistrate. She insists that she will go through with it to save Paul.Cordier follows Jeanne on her way home from the gallery. Waiting in the shadows, he pulls out a knife to stab her. Suddenly the reflection of a cross from a store window reflects on the shiny blade. His eyes show green for a moment. When he comes to his right mind, he notices the cross and the knife and throws it away.Standing in front of the church, Father Raymonde comes out and questions Cordier. He asks for sanctuary and wants to confess. Suddenly both of them are almost run down by a wagon. The driver (George Sawaya) finds the reins taken out of his hands, but finally the wagon stops. He runs back to see if the Reverend is all right. Cordier tells Raymonde to tell Jeanne to come see him later at his house.Cordier writes that the Horla is now trying to kill him. There is a knock at the door. Cordier answers and gives the box with his diary in it and the letter of explanation to Jeanne. He tells the Father to take her away safely and pray for him.In the study, Cordier extinguishes all lamps but one on his desk and waits for the Horla. When it comes in through the window, it stumbles around. Cordier tells it that he knows that it fears fire (since it would not cast the painting into the fire itself). He throws the lamp against the curtains and the fire ignites and spreads through the room. The Horla runs around in panic, trying to escape the room. He is unable to open the study door which has been locked by Cordier. With screams the Horla is shown burning to death. Cordier tries to unlock the door to escape but drops the key. He tries a couple of times to retrieve it, but unsuccessfully. The house is shown completely burning.At this point we rejoin the earlier scene where the diary was being read by Andre. Jeanne presses Rennedon about Pauls innocence. He agrees that the diary clears Paul. Andre suggests that the Horla was only in the mind of Cordier, but Father Raymonde cannot deny the presence of evil in the world. He says Cordier wanted everyone to know that as long as evil exists in the heart of man, the Horla lives."

He drinks it and she goes to light a candle.Outside, we see Johns wife Margaret (Barbara Steele) approach the house. John observes her from the window above. She is greeted by Charles for a moment, who then leaves.Margaret comes into the study carrying flowers. Taking a vase, she begins placing them in it. She notices John facing away in his chair. He tells her she is late and spent a long time in the garden. She explains it was a lovely day. He says that makes him feel even more of a cripple. He says he watched her with Charles, so remote from him and happy. She assures him that her joy was hearing that he was getting better from Charles and suggests that her love and attention surely means something to him. He apologizes and Catherine brings in a tray of coffee. Margaret dismisses Catherine, who leaves. Preparing a cup of coffee, Margaret hands it to John, who takes a sip and hands it back to her. He tells her that is all. She takes the cup back to the tray, and as she turns around to face John, she sees in horror that he is holding a gun on her. Slowly he repositions the gun to his head. Margaret rushes to get the gun away, telling him no. Having placed the gun down, Margaret tells John he shouldnt have done that. He replies that she will regret stopping him from killing himself one day, and that he is little more than a corpse.Catherine opens the door and asks if she can help. Margaret tells her that she can manage herself. Margaret helps John to the bed, where Catherine is plumping the pillows. Margaret begins undressing John for bed.Margaret is seen running to the greenhouse where she meets Charles and they embrace. She tells him that he should end their relationship, citing how difficult it is to pretend to be a supportive wife to John and carry on a secretive affair with Charles. He refuses to kill John, saying that it will only be a short time until John dies. They fall to the floor in an embrace.Margaret is seen bringing a straight razor to shave her husband. He reaches over and touches a panel which plays a music box. As she begins shaving him, he reminisces about meeting her thirteen years ago and how happy they were then. She hesitates with the razor at his throat, as if she were going to cut him. He notices her hesitation and looks up. She resumes shaving him and he continues talking. She warns him not to move, saying she will cut him. He asks for gin and she advises against it. He tells her that it brings back pleasant memories. She wipes off the remaining lather from his face and pours a glass of gin. He takes a sip of it, telling her to have some also. She sips from the glass.Canon Owens (Umberto Raho as Raoul H. Newman) enters and is greeted by John. The priest tells John he has something unpleasant to discuss with him. Margaret leaves as Owens sits and talks about the villagers complaining of satanic experiments being conducted in the house. John is implored to confine his work to the scientific and to leave the supernatural alone. As Owens holds up a test tube of white powder, John cautions him to be careful. He is told it contains curare, a paralyzing poison. Owens replaces it and apologizes.Charles is seen preparing a syringe for John. Margaret puts her hand upon Charles hand, professing her love.When Charles enters the study to administer the shot, he sees John playing chess with Dr. Albert Fisher (Reginald Price Anderson) and the Police Superintendant (Carlo Kechler as Charles Kechler). As John makes a final chess move,  checkmate  is called. The two men get up to leave, citing the lateness of the hour and the impending injection. The superintendant jokes about the locals complaining about more crimes suggested. John tells Dr. Fisher not to forget an envelope on the table. Placing it in his coat pocket, Fisher says he will not forget and they leave. Charles gives the shot to John, who begins palpitating and calling for the antidote.When the clock strikes the late hour, Charles tells Margaret that it has been an hour since the injection was given. Catherine comes in with a tray, telling them that John had told her he would not be coming down to dinner that evening. Both Charles and Margaret hear Johns bell ringing and go upstairs to investigate. Entering his room, they find the bell on the table and John dead in his chair. Charles does a visual exam and pronounces John dead.Next we see a graveside service led by Canon Owens. A small group of mourners are gathered and listen as the priest recites the Twenty-third Psalm. Then Charles and Margaret begin walking away. Others follow.As a dog howls outside, Margaret and Charles enter the house and embrace. She is upset by this howling, but Charles tells her there is nothing to fear and that they knew it would be difficult. They have each other. She begs him to shoot the dog and he does so. As they embrace again, a clattering noise is heard. She asks what it is and they look out a door. The wheelchair is seen moving, then falling down the stairs. Next they hear her name being called. Rushing to the sound of the voice, they open a door to find a vision of John calling Margarets name in a trance.The next morning we see Charles, Dr. Fisher, Canon Owens and the police superintendant waiting downstairs. Catherine comes in and strongly suggests that Charles remain to care for Margaret, whom she says has taken it hard. Margaret enters and greets everyone. Sitting at the table, Dr. Fisher reads the last will that was dictated by John just before the chess game. It states that the house and grounds be left to Margaret. It also states that all money, jewelry and bonds from the safe be donated to the orphanage run by Canon Owens. It further states that the remainder of his estate shall go to Margaret, providing that she continue to employ Catherine for the rest of her life. At this point, Dr. Fisher asks that the safe be opened by Margaret in his presence. They all move to the adjoining room where Margaret stands before the safe. She tells Dr. Fisher to find the key in the desk drawer. He looks and is unable to find it. She also looks and appears baffled. Catherine is asked if she knows where the key is, but she replies that no, only that it was always kept in that drawer. Fisher suggests that it may be forced open if the key is not found. Owens says it will not be necessary. As they leave, Fisher reminds her that if the key is not found, the police will have to force the safe open. Charles searches the drawer to no avail.Charles and Margaret begin a desperate search of Johns room, turning up nothing. At one point the music box begins playing, which unnerves Margaret. She grabs it and throws it to the floor, where it bursts into pieces. Catherine enters and tells Margaret that the master sometimes kept the key in the pocket of his coat-the one in which he was buried.Margaret laughs that the money cannot be accessed except by the key which John took to his grave. She then insists that Charles get the key.That night Margaret and Charles go into the mausoleum and open the coffin. Johns body is shown in severe decay, which is explained by Charles as due to the effects of the injections. Feeling around in coat pockets, Charles finds the key and they close the coffin.Returning to the study, Charles goes to open the safe. At this point, Catherine is heard calling for Charles. He tells Margaret to prevent her from entering. Margaret goes downstairs as Catherine approaches. Margaret seems to have a pain in her leg as she falls down. Catherine tells her that Charles is wanted at the hospital in town. Margaret insists that she is all right and that she will tell Charles.When she returns to the study, Charles is staring into space. Margaret asks what has happened and Charles informs her that the safe is empty. When she goes to look, there are only papers. She begins crying and Charles tries to quiet her. He tells her they will find it and leaves.That evening, Margaret prepares for bed. She sits before the dresser, brushing her hair. A strange noise attracts her attention. Calling to see if it is Charles, she looks over where the curtains are moving. The corpse of John appears, carrying a bouquet of flowers from the grave. Margaret gets a gun and fires several shots into the corpse to no effect. She collapses.Next we see Charles and Catherine attending to Margaret as she wakes up. She tells them that she saw John and fired shots into him. Charles looks behind the curtains but finds only bullet holes. Removing a bullet, he examines it.Later, Charles sits with Margaret as they hear a dripping sound. Blood is seen on the bed cover, dripping from the rafters. Charles insists on going upstairs to see what is causing it. Going from room to room, Charles sees the shadow of a hanged man. As he goes to look in the room from which the shadow projects from, the door closes and he struggles with it. Through the opening he sees John hanging. Finally the door opens and Charles enters the room.The next morning as Margaret gazes out the window, Catherine enters and informs her that Canon Owens is downstairs and wants to see her. She goes in and they sit at a table. Owens tells her that she missed the memorial service at the church and that the townspeople are talking about her and Charles living in the same house. She tells the priest to let people think what they will. He leaves and Charles comes in, chiding her for insulting the priest and reminding her that one slip could reveal their relationship to all. He blames her for Johns death, saying that she drove him to kill her husband. He confesses that his nerves are bothering him. She tells him that she will go upstairs and try to sleep. He cautions her to be careful, saying people are watching them.Margaret takes Charles suggestion, taking flowers to visit Johns grave. She is seen by several people. As she kneels with the flowers, the music box is heard playing.At dinner, Margaret sits alone. Catherine comes in and tries to get her to eat. She refuses and Catherine takes the plate away. Looking at the other place setting, Catherine asks if she should wait for Dr. Livingstone to arrive. At this point the music box is heard and Margaret asks if Catherine can hear it. She replies that she cannot hear anything. Margaret accuses her of lying and says it is coming from upstairs.Going into Johns room, Margaret hears thunder and the chandelier begins to sway. She begins looking at an open book of Johns which tells about astral projection of the body. A glass breaks and the chess pieces are brushed away. She reads more from the book. Suddenly a hand reaches for her shoulder. It is Catherine, who presents a snuff box that was a favorite of John. She tells Margaret that it was found in Charles room. Margaret begins thinking that maybe Charles found it in the safe and may have taken the money as well. She looks around the room and hears Johns laughter. He speaks and she sees him, talking to her and telling her that the treasure is hidden beneath the stone slab under the coffin.Margaret goes to the mausoleum and manages to overturn the coffin. She finds a door on the slab below and opens it. Inside is a golden chest which she removes. As she tries to open it, her hand is cut and begins bleeding. She opens the chest and finds only a skull. A shadow is seen approaching her. It is Catherine, who tells her that the treasure has already been taken. When Margaret asks by whom, she is told by the other person who lives in the house with them.Charles is seen packing his suitcase. Margaret comes in and he tells her he is leaving, before the evil gets any worse. She professes her love for him, but he insists that she will get over him. She begs him not to leave and accidently knocks over his case. It falls on the floor and jewelry spills out. As she picks it up and looks at it, she accuses Charles of stealing. He denies everything and claims he didnt know it was in his bag. He says that now its best they split up and continues packing. She spies the straight razor on the floor and picks it up. She attacks him with it, slashing repeatedly. Catherine is seen coming up the stairs slowly. Charles falls down to the floor.Margaret drags the body, now wrapped in a rug, of Charles who is still alive. Catherine looks out from a doorway as Margaret tries to move the body downstairs.Having gotten the body downstairs, Margaret douses it with lamp oil and sets it ablaze. The body burns.In Johns room, Margaret finds the two bottles: one of poison, the other of antidote. She takes the poison and pours some into a glass, adding some gin. She tries to drink a couple of times but hesitates. She sits in the wheelchair and hears a noise. The bookcase opens, revealing a secret room. John emerges and begins explaining how she was given curare through the hasp on the golden chest. He tells her she will be paralyzed just as he was before he began getting better from the treatment. He informs her that Charles was not a thief; he didnt know about the jewels being in his case. Catherine put them there, he says. He thanks Catherine for all shes done and tells her to leave. As she turns, he shoots her several times and she falls dead. He notices the glass of gin and drinks it. He tells Margaret that no witnesses can be left behind and that he had the riches all the time. The police are on their way, called by Catherine. As he goes to enter his secret room, the poison begins to affect him. He calls for the antidote. Margaret gets it from the table and holds it out for him to take. He reaches for it, only to see it fall to the floor and break, spilling the contents. He closes himself up in the bookcase and Margaret begins laughing maniacally. The police enter and take Margaret into custody. Canon Owens looks around the room and hears struggling behind the bookcase. He looks at the portrait of John. Speaking out loud, he repeats what he told John earlier:  the devil is a very real person."

"Captain Newman, M.D.",1963,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0056903/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"In 1944, an Army doctor is in charge of a neuropsychiatric ward at an Army Air Corps hospital in Arizona, and he must deal with a variety of tough cases. In 1944, Capt. Josiah J. Newman is the doctor in charge of Ward 7, the neuropsychiatric ward at an Army Air Corps hospital in Arizona. The hospital is under-resourced and Newman scrounges what he needs with the help of his inventive staff, especially Cpl. Jake Leibowitz. The military in general is only just coming to accept psychiatric disorders as legitimate and Newman generally has 6 weeks to cure them or send them on to another facility. Among his latest of the ward's many patients are Colonel Norville Bliss, who has dissociated from his past; Capt. Paul Winston, who is nearly catatonic after spending 13 months hiding in a cellar behind enemy lines; and 20-year-old Cpl. Jim Tompkins, who is severely traumatized after his aircraft was shot down. Others come and go, including Italian prisoners of war, but Newman and team all realize that their success means that the men will return to their units and combat.—garykmcd It's 1944, during WWII. During Captain Joe Newman, M.D.'s reign as head of the psychiatric ward at Colfax Air Force Base in Arizona, the number of patients in the ward has grown exponentially. According to Newman, the diagnoses are now only more accurate, not the number of Air Force personnel who have actually required psychiatric assistance. This assessment is against that of the base commander, Colonel Edgar Peyser, who believes many of the patients are fit for active war duty. Newman feels his ward is short staffed and he does whatever he needs to to get additional staff. So when Corporal Jake Leibowitz comes to the hospital to be assigned to work as an orderly in another ward, Newman manages to abscond the reluctant Leibowitz to work in the psych ward. One not high on ceremony, the excitable and energetic Leibowitz adds a little needed levity into the day-to-day operations of the ward, although many of his actions are less than military regulation. Newman also coerces the beautiful nurse, Lieutenant Francie Corum, to transfer into the ward, Newman believing her beauty will soothe the patients' psyches. Three of the more interesting cases in the ward are that of: Colonel Norville Bliss, who knows he needs help but isn't sure what is causing his mental breaks; Captain Paul Winston, whose primary symptom is a constant need to sleep, his mental issues which his VIP family would rather not deal with directly; and Corporal Jim Tompkins, whose excessive alcohol consumption, insomnia and bravado overshadow his real emotional issues.—Huggo Dr. Josiah Newman runs the psychiatric unit of a U.S. Military Hospital during WWII. Short of help, Newman coerces newly-arrived neurotic orderly Jackson Leibowitz to work in his ward. Leibowitz's scheming and humor quickly turns life inside the ward upside down. Newman, while amused, tries to maintain a semblance of order. Newman's other recruit to the ward is nurse Lt. Francie Corum. Corum is at first shocked by what she sees in the ward, but admires the compassionate and effective way that Newman deals with each of his patients. Together Newman and Corum help a variety of patients with war related psychological traumas while they themselves struggle with the dilemma of healing these soldiers so they can be sent back into battle to face possible death.—E.W.

Feeling the problem partly her fault for devoting her life to him, Peg figures one small part of fixing the problem is to make a life of her own irrespective of him, namely to get a job, which Charlie opposes. What Peg doesn't tell him about that job in addition, even after it's up and running, is that she has started her own opposing cab company, Glamcabs, their town which can realistically only support one cab company. What gives Glamcabs a leg up on Speedee Taxi is that Peg has solely hired as drivers young attractive women all wearing skimpy uniforms.

During a merciless drought, the brute nature of man and the delicate essence of woman become inextricably intertwined, as the omnipotence of the carnal instinct demands the total surrender of the flesh. Parallel stories of Eros set in 200 B.C. Nomadic shepherds, plagued by drought, happen on a fishing encampment with plentiful fresh water. The local men are away but will return when it rains; the shepherds stay to refresh their flock until the rain comes. A shepherd lad and a local girl, both on the verge of puberty, start a mating dance. Also, one of the shepherds approaches a beautiful local woman, inviting her to sleep with him. How will she respond? She's married, her husband at sea for the week. Is love forever or temporary? A subtext dramatizes the capture of fish, birds, foxes, and other animals: their fates seem arbitrary.—<jhailey@hotmail.com> In the old book, the year is 200 BC.

Crooks in Clover,1963,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0057591/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A dying mob boss hands over his business to an old friend, Fernand. The boss' assistants want to get rid of the latter. But are the Volfoni brothers and Théo real threats? Ensuing fights and shootouts are more comical than deadly. Ex-gangster Fernand (Lino Ventura) receives a call from a dying friend, a mob boss nicknamed ""The Mexican"". The doomed mobster talks Fernand into taking care of some criminal business and looking after his soon-to-be-married daughter. When a longtime mobster heavy, Volfoni takes exception to Fernand for being an outsider, they come after Fernand who is equal to the task. He defends himself in a series of comical killings from the onslaught of the mob.—Anonymous A Public Works Plant in Montauban, in the South-East of France. Late in the evening, the boss, Fernand Naudin (Lino Ventura), takes his car to go to Paris on some urgent matter. Which bothers his assistant because of the annual Fair on the next week-end.Early in the morning, Fernand arrives in Paris on the Champs-Elysées, to meet his old friend, Louis (Jacques Dumesnil), who just came back from Mexico, where he had gone fifteen years before, to get away from French justice. They remained very close friends, even after Fernand change to legal business. The meeting place is a bowling alley, where Fernand is met by another friend of Louis, Henri (Paul Mercey), the manager of the place.In an apartment above the bowling alley, Louis is lying in bed, where a doctor is giving him a shot. After the doctor is gone, Louis explains Fernand that he is very ill, and that he came back to France do die and be buried next to his parents. He also tells Fernand about his 18-year old daughter, Patricia, whose mother was a hooker friend of him, and whom he would like Fernand to take care of after his death. Money is no problem, since Louis has several not quite legal business, but which work very smoothly, and which get enough money for Patricia's needs. Nevertheless Fernand is not very happy about the idea.Their heated conversation is stopped by the arrival of Louis' assistants, Raoul (Bertrand Blier) and Paul (Jean Lefebvre) Volfoni, who run a clandestine and illegal roulette on a barge, and Théo (Horst Frank), who runs an illegal distillery. Théo, who is homosexual, has come with his boyfriend, Vincent (Georges Nojaroff), whom Louis doesn't want to be present. Louis tells the three remaining men that Fernand is now in charge of his business, which doesn't seem to please Raoul Volfoni. But Pascal (Valentino Venantini), Louis' gunman, being around, neither the Volfoni brothers nor Théo don't say much about it.After they're gone, Fernand remains alone with Louis. When Louis has an attack, Fernand calls Pascal to help him and Louis dies in both men's arms.After Louis' death, Fernand goes back in the bowling alley, where Henri gets him something to eat. The Volfoni brothers try to talk Fernand out of taking over Louis' business, but Fernand refuses not to keep a promise made to a dying friend. Their conversation is interrupted by a phone call from Tomate, who runs a illegal roulette in a farm. Tomate seems to have some problem with nervous patrons. Pascal wants to have a look and Fernand asks him to go with him. After their departure, Théo, who, unlike the Volfoni, didn't say a word to Fernand, tells Vincent, his boyfriend, that he has just taken care of Fernand as a problem.Pascal and Fernand reach the farm, but they've just left their car when they get machine-gunned from a gunman in a big American car. Pascal kills both the gunman and the driver, and then goes inside the farm, followed by a slightly disturbed Fernand, who wonders if the Volfoni are not the sponsors of the dead gunman. Pascal agrees with him.Tomate (Charles Régnier), alone in the roulette room, seems very surprised by what Pascal and Fernand tell him. He sends his henchman, Freddy (Henri Cogan), to clean the mess made by the gun fight, and then he explains to Fernand that he had no problem that evening in the roulette room, and consequently that he never phoned the bowling alley. But when Fernand phones the bowling alley, he learns that Henri has been shot and killed, and that the police is already there.Pascal drives Fernand to the 18th century manor that Louis had bought for his daughter, who lives there with her two «uncles», Folace (Francis Blanche), who is a shady attorney in charge of Louis' business, and Jean (Robert Dalban), who is a former burglar, adopted by Louis, and converted into a butler. Pascal goes back home and Folace explains to Fernand that Patricia is a bit of a problem, because she consistently gets kicked out of every private school she goes to. Fernand, who wants to get back to Montauban as soon as possible, tells Folace that he is going to make Patricia understand how she must behave. Folace also tells Jean and Fernand that Patricia must never know that her father, whom she knows only through his letters, is dead.Next morning, Fernand is shaving when Patricia (Sabine Sinjen) enters the bathroom. She teases Fernand, whom her father, in his letters, describes as some sort of modern knight. When Fernand tells her they must have a serious conversation, she gets away.A bit later, Folace tells Fernand that Louis' business is not running as smoothly as he thought, and even less since Louis' «assistants» learned about his death.Fernand then meets Patricia's fiancé, Antoine Delafoy (Claude Rich), a musical genius or so he pretends himself to be ! Actually he is a very smart young man, a bit eccentric, and who keeps on talking all the time, to Fernand's obvious annoyance.Pascal discreetly interrupts Fernand's conversation with Antoine, to tell him that Louis' «assistants» are holding a secret meeting on the Volfoni's barge. Fernand feels like going to see what it's all about, along with the very efficient Pascal. Antoine doesn't believe in Fernand's unexpected board meeting, and thinks Fernand is going to meet some girl !Around the roulette table inside the barge, are gathered the Volfoni brothers, Théo, Vincent, Tomate, Freddy, and Madame Mado (Dominique Davray) who runs an illegal brothel. Raoul is trying to get them to do something about the situation, but Théo objects that, since Louis' death, there have been too many murders around.On the barge deck, Fernand, Pascal and Folace are met by Léo, who is the barge «official» skipper. When Léo says he wants to ask the Volfoni before letting his visitors inside the barge, Fernand punches him and sends him into the river.In the roulette room, the meeting is very heated, when someone knocks at the door. Freddy opens the door and gets Fernand's fist in his face. Pascal walks in behind Fernand with a gun in each hand. Bastien (Marc Ronay), Volfoni's gunman, wants to react, but Raoul stops him.Fernand sits down, and, with the help of Folace, goes on with important matters. He asks Mado about the irregular management of her brothel. She defends her business with quite a sense of humor. Fernand turns to Théo, who talks about his problems with illegal alcohol.Meanwhile, in a small room near the entrance of the roulette room, the two gunmen, Pascal and Bastien, are talking shop and showing each other's guns.After Théo's, Fernand opens the Volfoni's file. He explains he has decided to make their bookkeeping much easier : he will just ask them to pay this year what they paid the year before. He then asks Pascal to come and get their money during the coming week.Fernand and friends leave the room with Bastien. After they've gone, Mado makes fun of Raoul, whom she finds a bit of a coward. Raoul gets very angry when she says that. Then someone knocks at the door and he crosses the room to open it. He gets Fernand's fist in his face. Fernand tells him that he gives him an extra ten percent on his debt because of the delay.Back to the manor, Fernand finds Patricia and Antoine seated close to each other on a sofa, listening to Corelli in the dark. He sends Patricia to her room and Antoine out of the house.Later in the evening, Fernand is listening to the Corelli record while eating some chicken, when Pascal and Bastien enter discreetly through a French window. The two gunmen explain to Fernand that they've found they are related, and the dispute between Fernand and the Volfoni is giving them a moral dilemma. They are afraid that, one day, they will have to face each other, guns in hand. So Bastien has just resigned his job with the Volfoni and Pascal is doing the same with Fernand.A few days later, Fernand is reading a dissertation Patricia wrote about Corneille, Racine, Bossuet and Pascal. He finds it so good that he thinks that the teacher could have given her a higher grade. He is interrupted by a call from one of his assistants in Montauban.A few moments later, Folace explains to Fernand that the expected money didn't come in when he gets interrupted by a call from Raoul, who tells him there are some problem at the distillery.At the distillery, Tomate asks Théo if he thinks Fernand believed what they suggested the too naïve Raoul to tell him. The answer is the noise made by Fernand's car arriving at the distillery. Théo explains to Tomate and Freddy that, after they get rid of Fernand, they will just have to get also rid of the Volfoni brothers, and then they will be the only bosses of the late Louis' business.After he has sent his assistants on their duties, Théo greets Fernand with a feigned surprise. He explains to Fernand that his problem is that he just lost the driver who was supposed to drive a truck full of moonshine (illegal alcohol), and because he, Théo, doesn't have a driver's license anymore, he asked Raoul to get him a new driver. Fernand tells him he is going to drive the truck himself.To reach the «meeting place», Fernand has to cross the Fontainebleau forest. This is where Théo and Tomate are waiting for him with a machine-gun. They shoot the truck, which gets off the road, and then starts burning. Fernand succeeds in leaving the truck, and with a burned and torn suit, he reaches the Volfoni barge.There, he knocks Raoul out, and then empty the open safe. Paul Volfoni, who does not understand a word of what Fernand tells him about trucks and moonshine, nevertheless lets the very angry Fernand takes the money out of the safe.When Fernand gets back at the manor with his bag full of money, it is to find that his «niece» Patricia is having a party where she invited a lot of young idle «bourgeois». Many sport cars are parked in front of the manor. When one of the owners of one of these sport cars says something quite inappropriate about the relationship between Patricia and Antoine, Fernand feels he has to give the young guy a good thrashing.He then enters the manor, where all the young guests are dancing while Jean is moving around them with a tray full of drinks. Fernand has a little chat with Patricia, and then goes to the kitchen.In the kitchen, Folace is buttering toasts for the guests. Fernand shows him the money inside the bag. When Jean sees Fernand torn suit, and when Fernand tells him it is the work of the Volfoni, Jean puts a gun in his pocket.A quite useful decision when, a few minutes later, the Volfoni brothers enter the manor. Jean guide them to the kitchen, where they get in, gun in hand. Jean comes in behind them, pointing his own gun in their backs, and he asks them to give him their guns. Paul, to calm the situation down, start buttering the toasts. A very drunk girl enters the kitchen, because she is looking for a drink. When she takes some money in the bag to buy drinks, Folace is so aggressive with her that she goes out very quickly.Raoul says he would like very much to share a drink with his friends, but Folace tells him that the kid have drunk everything in the house, and that the only bottle left is an old bottle of moonshine whisky. Even those tough men find it a bit strange to drink, and get drunk very quickly.Meanwhile, Antoine is telling Patricia he feels like telling «uncle Fernand» about their love.Back in the kitchen, all the men are completely drunk. Raoul feels like visiting the bathroom very urgently, and rushes out of the kitchen.When Raoul goes out of the bathroom, he feels better, even though he is still drunk, and he starts flirting with Patricia, offering to give her a «job» in Egypt. Patricia knows very well what kind of a job he means, but Antoine doesn't find it very funny.Back in the kitchen, Raoul tells Fernand about the «inappropriate» jealousy of Antoine, and Fernand decides it is time to close the shop.Helped by the Volfoni brothers and Folace, Fernand kicks all the guests out of the house. The men are so excited by their job that they even kick Paul Volfoni out, which makes them laugh a lot. But they stop laughing when they see Patricia crying on the staircase.Next morning, Folace wakes up Fernand to tell him that Patricia has gone away during the night with her suitcase. Fortunately, Jean wrote down the license plate of the taxicab who took her away.The cab driver brings Fernand to Antoine's apartment. When Fernand walks in the living-room, Antoine is experimenting «musique concrète» (concrete music). He doesn't seem to appreciate Fernand interrupting him. But Patricia calms Fernand down when she walks in from the kitchen. She tells her «uncle» she is going to marry Antoine. Fernand likes the idea better when she tells him that Antoine's father is vice-president of the International Monetary Fund.Two or three days later, it is Fernand's birthday. Early in the morning, Patricia, Jean and Folace give him a present each. Patricia adds a present brought in very early from the Volfoni brothers. When Fernand hears a threatening tick-tock coming from the parcel, he throws it through the open window, and the parcel explodes in the garden. We can see Théo and Vincent walking discreetly away.Fernand goes to the Volfoni's barge, and, when Raoul opens the door, Fernand sings «Happy Birthday» and then punches Raoul violently on the nose. After his departure, Raoul fixes a small bomb to get his own back on Fernand.During the night, Fernand hears a strange noise and puts a gun in his night-robe pocket.Meanwhile in the garage, Raoul is putting his bomb inside Fernand's car. He sends his brother away to check on the surroundings, and after Paul's departure, Fernand walks discreetly in the garage.After Fernand has «taken care» of Raoul, we find the latter in an hospital room, covered with bandages and plaster casts.Fernand's «accident» with the truck full of moonshine is in the newspapers' front page. But Pascal and Bastien tells Fernand it was wrong of him to think it was the Volfoni's fault. They explain that, if the Volfoni had decided to kill Fernand or Henri, the first person they would have asked to do it would have been Bastien, their official gunman. Pascal thinks the whole business comes from Théo. Fernand asks Pascal and Bastien to go and have a friendly chat with Théo.In the distlllery, Pascal and Bastien do not find Théo, but only Tomate. They make him talk and then kill him. When he finds Tomate's body, Théo understands he is next on their list, and he decides to take care of Fernand before Fernand takes care of him.Théo, Vincent and Freddy try to storm the manor, but Folace, Jean and Fernand don't let them do it and fight back. In the middle of a gunfight that looks like something out of a Western movie, Amédée Delafoy (Pierre Bertin), Antoine's father, crosses the park to ask «Uncle Fernand» the hand of his «niece» Patricia for his son. The gunfight goes on, but, because Amédée is deaf as a doorpost, he doesn't hear a thing ! He begins to have a feeling that something may be wrong when a bullet hits the ceiling above him and he gets covered with plaster ! The gunfight stops with the arrival of Pascal and Bastien. Théo thinks that, with two marksmen on the other side, the fight is not fair anymore.To take his own back for his defeat, Théo waits for Raoul coming out of the hospital along with his brother, and shoots them. Both Raoul and Paul Volfoni are back in an hospital room, both covered with bandages and plaster casts !A few days later, Fernand is getting his «niece» married. He is wearing a frock coat and has a quiet chat with the bridegroom, Antoine, when Pascal comes in discreetly to warn him that Théo is leaving the distillery with his friends. Fernand asks Jean and Folace to take care of the guests while he is going to take care of Théo with Pascal and Bastien, who is waiting for them at the distillery.At the distillery, Théo and Freddy are sorting out important or incriminating documents, which Théo puts inside a bag. When Vincent comes in to tell them about Fernand's arrival, they take their weapons to give Fernand a warm welcome.The first to die is Vincent, burned to death by a jerry can full of gasoline, set on fire by Bastien. Next comes Freddy, who, after a long fistfight with Fernand, breaks through a brick wall on the first floor of the building down to the ground.Théo succeeds in escaping with his car. But Pascal prevents Fernand from running after him, because it is almost wedding time. Pascal and Bastien help Fernand to fix his frock coat, a bit torn during the fight, and bring him in front of the church just when Folace was starting to think he would never see him.While the service is going on inside the church, Théo parks in front of the church, and gets his machine-gun ready for Fernand and guests when they walk out of the church.Inside the church, every one is listening to the organ and choral music, when they hear a loud blast coming from outside the church. They all turn their heads toward the door, through which Pascal and Bastien walk in very quietly, and make a respectful sign of the cross.The last scene of the film shows Théo's car burning in front of the church with Théo inside the car !"

Vice and Virtue,1963,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0056658/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Set against the backdrop of the Nazi occupation of France, VICE AND VIRTURE is a stylized retelling of the Marquis de Sade's Justine, as envisioned by one of cinema's most provocative filmmakers Roger Vadim. Roger Vadim opens this movie with a short introduction. He explains to the viewers that this story uses history as a backdrop to explore human themes, and with that places himself with the likes of Shakespeare, who used the same method to explore the human condition. Whilst the basis of the movie occurs during the last year of the 2d world war, German officers keep young and pretty girls as prisoners in a French castle for their only sexual pleasure while the others are fighting. The movie is a parable about human passions as the 120 days in Sodoma from Alphonse Donatien de Sade. All the story is fictitious.This movie is much than the superficial elements as described in the paragraph above (by the first writer). It is a story of power, survival, opportunity, greed, lust, and love. WWII provides an ample setting for these human emotions to play itself out. Some viewers may not believe there is much love, yet this deserves more attention.Love has many faces and is an emotion that bares its soul in a variety of ways, using broken and bitter people who, through circumstances from WWII, find themselves expressing love that is both crippled and heart wrenching.Finally this movie questions other concepts, so important in war, such as camaraderie, patriotism, losing and winning, and how soldiers manage these additional pressures when confronted on a daily basis.This is an intense movie, and although it can be confusing at times with so much Roger Vadim wants to say, he has shown considerable skill in trying to tie all these elements together."

He asks his old ailing friend, a legend among attorneys, for help on the case as his consultant. US Air Force veteran Ben Brown has been charged with the murder of aging Cole Clinton, a leading citizen of Durango County, New Mexico. Several months after the discovery of Clint's dead body, Ben was turned in to the authorities for a reward by his wife, Laura Mae Brown, who claims she witnessed the murder. Ben has signed two confessions to killing Clint, who picked up the Browns hitchhiking on the road on his way back home from an out-of-town cattle auction. In addition to the charge against Ben, Laura Mae is charged as a co-defendant, her trial to be separate from Ben's. Although the alleged murder did not happen in Durango County, the trial is held there where most of Clint's friends and family will definitely be in attendance, their goal to see Ben convicted and executed. Instead of District Attorney Paul Farish, Norris Bixby has been appointed special prosecutor to try the case. James Tucker, the presiding judge, appoints a surprised young widowed attorney named David Mitchell, to represent Ben. David's surprise is because he is not currently a trial lawyer, his recent work, especially since the death of his wife Lillian three years ago, being solely research, specifically writing briefs. David learns that his appointment was partly orchestrated by his mentor, respected invalid lawyer Art Harper, who wants to see Ben get a fair trial and get David out of his funk and back into trying cases. Even before working on the case, David sees it as an overall losing situation, he will not be able to get Ben off, and will get no business following this case for representing the popular Clint's killer. David doesn't even yet realize how much the cards are stacked against him and Ben as Bixby, an ambitious man, has managed to manipulate the evidence for the trial to be a slam dunk in his favor to advance his political aspirations. As such, David believes the trial will be a lynching. In meeting Laura Mae for the first time, David finds that she is a young woman who uses sex to her advantage and who cares nothing for Ben. Ben, on the other hand, seems only to care about Laura Mae and her welfare. As David comes closer to discovering the whole story which looks to be justifiable homicide under New Mexico law, he has to decide how to negotiate the problematic case.

Based in Midland, Texas, Henry Tyroon, with a highly analytical mind, is a wealthy and knowledgeable proverbial wheeler dealer who over the past several years has focused on oil speculation. He likes to play up that good ol' boy Texas stereotype arguably to take advantage of potential business associates underestimating him, although three of those true elderly Texas good ol' boys, Ray J., Jay R., and J.R., will do whatever to buy into whatever Henry's latest venture in knowing his winning streak. When Henry's latest oil wells come up dry, he is forced to head to the financial center of New York City to raise $1.2 million in capital from possible investors, investments and other financial deals. Knowing that he can only raise part of that money from his regular investors, he heads to the brokerage firm of Bear, Osgood and Whitby to look into a partnership concerning tax shelters. Uninterested in such, partner Bullard Bear instead assigns his only female security analyst Molly Thatcher to be Henry's broker, she one of the few female analysts working on Wall Street and who Bear has also assigned to head one of their long held and forgotten securities, Universal Widget. In reality unknown to Molly, Bear and Whitby have assigned her this file in knowing that Universal Widget is a proverbial dog in it long not having manufactured anything let alone useless widgets despite the company still being incorporated in Massachusetts. They need to fire one analyst, and despite she more competent than most of her male counterparts, Bear wants an excuse to fire her as the token woman whose firing would minimize internal talk. Bear even hopes that Molly may be able to unload their investment in the company to unwitting Henry. But Henry being Henry, he finds a way to make money off the endeavor when he and Molly discover the reason why Universal Widget is still incorporated despite not actively doing anything besides existing.

He meets Molly Thatcher, a Wall Street stock analyst, whose boss, Bullard Bear, has assigned her to boost a stock (Universal Widget) that--though not to her knowledge--is apparently worthless. Molly's salary is an expense the firm can no longer afford, and they wish to be rid of her. Henry decides to help Molly with Universal Widget, maneuvering her boyfriend out of the way and dating her himself. Among the other side interests that Henry buys while in the city are a taxicab and driver, a chic restaurant, an art collection, and an abstract artist named Stanislas. In Massachusetts, Molly and Henry discover that Widgets went out of production in 1854, but they create an advertising campaign to promote the stock. They meet the Whipples, laconic New Englanders who own the hidden assets of Universal Widget, now a booming concern, and Henry strikes oil on Widget property. As Widget stock soars, a suspicious SEC investigates; and Henry, Molly, the Whipples, and assorted other characters are taken to court. Henry is revealed as a Yale man, not a Texan, and the Widget oil is discovered to stem from a pipeline. Molly, eased out of her job at this point, believes Henry responsible.

He even gives her permission to sleep with other men, as long as she doesn't leave him for another man. Her presence creates jealous tensions between men. The foreman declares himself in-love with her and offers to quit his job and run away with her. But Catherine is non-committal and flirts with several workers. During the hot days, she provocatively sun-tans in a bra and a skimpy skirt. This inflames the crew, especially the foreman. Rebuked on several occasions and with just one day remaining before the ambulance's arrival, the wounded ex-husband decides to act.—nufs68"

He took in his now young adult nephew and niece, Webb and June Carter, upon the unfortunate circumstances concerning their parents, Webb who is learning to be ranch hand, his hotheadedness which often gets in the way. Sam is trying to do ranching differently, having a closed range of his own land as a more sustainable method. He erecting fences to keep other cattle out does not sit well with many of his neighboring ranchers, especially his former mentor, Clay Mathews, a Texas cattle baron who wants that open range all the way from Texas to the Canada border. Sam believes Clay's self interest is driven by he having purchased too many cattle for what his own land can support, he wanting eventually to oversupply the market with his inferior product at the end of the season to make millions. Sam also believes Clay is behind the cutting of his wire fences. One other smaller neighboring ranch which has split priorities is that owned and operated by the Travers siblings. Henry Travers, an alcoholic, is a man with no backbone who is easily manipulated by the strongest voice, in this case being Clay. On the other side is Henry's sister, Sharleen Travers, who does most of the work on the ranch in Henry's uselessness, and who is in a relationship with Sam. Clay has hired muscle in the form of Vince Bodine to carry out his dirty work, Vince who, beyond carrying out Clay's wishes, seems to enjoy the role as the heavy for being the heavy's sake. Clay and Vince have come up with a way to inflict maximum pain on Sam's neighbors making it look like Sam is behind it all in an effort to gain those neighbors' support. As the fight seems to become more and more personal between Sam and Clay, another factor influencing what happens in the matter is the visit to the region of President Chester A. Arthur, and which side gets his ear.—Huggo"

Dennison is on assignment to destroy one of their own unused field bases of all usable equipment so that the enemies cannot get their hands on any of it, and transport the oil stored there to the new field base. Captain Van Ryn, a civilian sailor helming a cargo ship under the Finnish flag and thus being officially neutral, has been contracted to transport the military men and the oil.

However, Van Ryn assigns him to be kept on board in the same quarters as the Americans. Shortly after setting sail, the Americans receive a new order due to the circumstance at the new base: instead of transporting the enemy pilot to the camp, they are instead to execute him. This order results in a further conflict between Briscoe, the obedient soldier with the perfect record who will not risk his military pension especially so close to retirement, and Dennison, the intellectual who sees the order as being cold blooded murder, plain and simple, and who further sees Briscoe as a sadist at heart. Caught in the middle is Hackett, who is keeping a secret which pulls him in opposite directions. Affecting what happens is being aboard the ship led by Van Ryn, the fact that they are still in active combat, they all surviving the journey not a guarantee as they could be under enemy attack if in the wrong situation, and what is truly in each of their hearts which may be different than what each portrays on the surface.—Huggo"

She is to be the ward of Julian's widowed cousin, Charles Poole, the headmaster of Hallow, a proper upper class boys' school, he who has two offspring living with him: his twenty-something unhappy and soon to be divorced daughter, Diana, who is secretly, or not so secretly, dating the school's indecisive art teacher, Tim Clove; and his eighteen year old son, Richard Poole, a student at the school. Tamahine is blissfully unaware that her frank talk, especially about what she calls ""loving"", and her various states of undress are causing an uproar at the school. That ""loving"" is typical for a girl her age back home, and thus she being the wanted object of affection of many of the opposite sex at Hallow is what she wants, Richard and Tim among those who admit their attraction to her. However, a romance with blood relations as close as Richard she considered taboo. Regardless of what is considered her scandalous behavior, Tamahine may open up some of the joyless repression of many of those at Hallow.—Huggo"

While French Police Chief Maurice Desjardins is busy having careless fun with some loose girls, members of the French Resistance kill a man at the harbor and steal his briefcase full of important documents from the Third Reich. At an apartment building in the distance, Andre Kuhn watches the whole operation through his powerful binoculars. He is posing as a businessman but actually working as a spy for the Germans a fact totally ignored by his live-in girlfriend Teresa Villar, a beautiful Spanish singer who works at El Dorado Night Club. Andre telephones Max von Stauffen, the head of German Intelligence in Casablanca, to inform him of what he has just witnessed. Max tells him to stay put until he arrives in order to get the information personally but, by the time he reaches Andres apartment, he finds him dead with a gun shot on his temple.At El Dorado is show time and Teresa performs to an appreciative audience. In her dressing room she finds Max von Stauffen who notifies her of Andres assassination and the whole spy business. Teresa is both surprised and devastated by the news. Max promises to avenge Andres death and asks for her assistance to achieve that goal. Not quite knowing how she can help, Teresa accepts. Later that night Max instructs Police chief Maurice to arrest Teresa and bring her to Intelligence headquarters. In spite of her protests, Teresa is arrested and thrown in a cell where she spends all night.The following morning she is led to von Stauffens office and he apologizes for the incident explaining that it was necessary for his plans to capture Andres killers. By arresting her, she is now publicly perceived as at odds with the Nazis and more likely to be trusted by the French resistance. From now on Teresas job will be to continue charming the public at El Dorado while befriending certain men that Max considers suspects of anti-German activities. Teresa agrees reluctantly believing it is her duty to help catch her boyfriends assassin and Max strengthens his control over her by retaining her passport. With all matters taken care of, the Nazi official releases Teresa to Maurice with instructions to take her back home. During the drive back, Maurice openly flirts with Teresa much to her annoyance. Meanwhile, a Swiss named Lucien and his comrades in the French resistance are trying to decipher the documents seized from the man they killed at the harbor. Unfortunately they cant break the code and decide to wait for their leader whom they call El Lobo (The Wolf) to get his opinion on the matter. Lucien doesnt know that he is the first suspect targeted by von Stauffen and assigned to Teresa.At El Dorado, Lucien is in attendance with some friends and Teresa spots him from the stage. She flirts with him using all her powers of seduction and is finally asked to join him at his table. After a few drinks, Lucien takes her to his place where, in more intimate surroundings, Teresa tries to dig information from him but he is more interested in romancing her. However, they are interrupted by Luciens comrade Pierrot and Teresa manages to listen to their conversation. They talk about an Arab native who assisted in the harbor attack and is now demanding more money since his camel was killed in the shooting. Lucien tells Pierrot to come back later for a meeting and sends him away. Alone again, Teresa continues seducing Lucien but they are interrupted again, this time, surprisingly by Police Chief Maurice who arrives with a gang of male and female revelers. Suddenly, there an impromptu party going on and Teresa tries to leave but is stopped by Maurice who seems intent in befriending her. She stays at the party and is later driven back to her hotel by Maurice who asks her about her feelings for Lucien. She slips away without giving him a straight answer.Later that night, back at Luciens, there is a formal meeting of the Resistance attended by the mysterious El Lobo, who happens to be Maurice. He orders Pierrot to kill the money-hungry Arab with the dead camel and reminds all that there is a war going on and that they should all be ready to kill whenever necessary. He stresses the point that sometimes is necessary to kill a friend before allowing him to be arrested and tortured by the Nazis. The following morning Teresa meets with von Stauffen and gives him a detailed account of what transpired the previous night. He finds her story quite interesting and tells Teresa that the Secret Service will try to catch the Arab native and get from him the necessary information to catch Lucien. That way Teresa will not be suspected by anybody and she can continue her work for the agency. Teresa is quite surprised and even amused when Max orders her to concentrate her efforts now on Maurice since she considers him a womanizer good-for-nothing clown but the officer is quite serious about the request.Soon the Nazis locate and arrest the native with the dead camel who, upon interrogation, reveals the identity and whereabouts of Pierrot. Meanwhile, Teresa and Maurice are all over Casablanca romancing and having fun. All of the sudden, at the street market place, there is a big commotion and they see how the police has cornered Pierrot. Maurice catches up with the action and cold-bloodily kills Pierrot while Teresa watches in horror. The Nazis are also upset since their orders were to catch Pierrot alive. Visibly shook up, Maurice leaves with Teresa and they go back to her place where Maurice tries to justify his actions by confessing the truth about his life but she stops him. Teresa has realized that she truly cares for him and doesnt want to know anything that she might have to report to Max later. With show time approaching, Teresa and Maurice drive to El Dorado . He stays in the audience while she goes to her dressing room to change for the nights performance. Teresa is shocked to find Lucien hiding there who informs her that the Nazis are after him and that he must talk to Maurice immediately. Teresa locks him up and, during her performance, passes the dressing room key to Maurice who immediately understand whats going on. Maurice tries to help Lucien escape but he is caught anyway by von Stauffen and his men.After these developments, Teresa knows that Maurice and his closest comrades must leave the country at once. However all visas and travel permits have been suspended by Max and the only way to travel abroad is with documents stamped with the Secret Service seal. Teresa suggests that she could help obtain the seal and Maurice all of the sudden realizes that she works for the Germans. However he loves her and trusts her and, as it is, she is the only hope. Next they stop at a building where Maurice collaborators run underground radio communications. They have received a message from a U.S. submarine that is willing to wait offshore to pick them up in case they can get out of Casablanca. Maurice informs them of Teresas offer and convinces them to give her the chance to try, although they are not too happy to trust a Nazi spy. At Secret Service headquarters, Teresa meets with Max and gives him information about the underground radio operation and other details. While briefly alone in the office she goes into Max desk, finds the seal and stamps the documents that will allow Maurice and his friends to flee the country. In the desk she also finds her own passport but leaves it there so that Max doesnt suspect anything and the men have time to get away. Outside she turns over the documents to Maurice and lies to him about her passport assuring him that she has it and will meet him in Lisbon in a few days. Actually she knows she is doomed and will never be able to leave Casablanca alive.At El Dorado Teresa sings again what might be her last song. In her dressing room von Stauffen waits for her. He already knows what shes done and his duty is to put her in jail where she would certainly be tortured and killed. However, he is impressed when she tells him that she did it for love and would do it again if necessary. She is ready to face her destiny. Max draws from his pocket her passport, stamps it and hands it over to her while reminding her of the next flight to Lisbon. Teresa can hardly believe this turn of events and thanks Max profusely. He exits while pointing out that he had always cared for the safety of his agents. Offshore, Maurice and his friends are safely in their way to freedom. THE END."

Low budget and in b&w, it's set in Greenwich Village, with what seems like a mostly improvised script. It begins as a late film noir crime tale involving a bank robbery where only one of a group of thieves escapes with his life, as well as $90,000 in loot. Injured and on the run, he hides in a local tour bus and is soon taken in by a group of bohemians who shoot him full of morphine to ease his pain and let him sleep it off on a mattress. Mason is the head beatnik. There's also the owner of both an upstairs coffeehouse and garret, where these beatniks hang out. They, in turn, bring the tourist trade in. Although the robbery is supposed to be the main focus of the plot, it quickly turns into more of a character study featuring these rebellious bon vivants and their odd lifestyle, which includes smoking and selling dope, mooching at art galleries, long conversations about all sorts of things and a beat shindig, shot Cinema Verite style in the director's actual apartment.

After lamenting being alone, Boris falls head over heals for a museum guide, Lida. She resists his advances but that doesn't stop Boris. She leads him to her friends, Masha and Sasha, who are planning to get married and are elated to have recently received permission to move into an apartment in the Moscow Cheryomushki. On her way home (with Boris constantly tagging along), Lida discovers along with her father that the roof of their apartment has collapsed and is now uninhabitable. After some amazingly quick work, they receive permission to move into the same Cheryomushki. Working as a steam shovel engineer at this Cheryomushki is Lyusya, who is Sergei's girlfriend. She also has just obtained an apartment there and is waiting to hear the question that Sergei is too shy to ask.

Drebednev is the corrupt real estate manager who gives (or more often doesn't give) permission for people to take an apartment in the Cheryomushki. Additionally, Vava is a friend of Boris. To make Vava happier, Boris convinces Drebednev to expand their 2-bedroom apartment into a 4-room apartment. But when he breaks down the walls, he has to evict the tenants in the next apartment, Lida and her father. They are heartbroken and have to now worry about going through the long process of receiving another apartment. Meanwhile, as Masha and Sasha move in, they discover that none of their neighbors have keys, so they all spend an evening of singing and dancing in Masha's and Sasha's apartment. Realizing Lida's plight, Boris suggests to Vava that two 2-bedroom apartments are better than one 4-bedroom apartment. Drebednev returns the aparment to Lida and her father, is unmasked as a bureaucrat, and Vava chooses to get a divorce. Finally, through the help of a bench, Sergei gets the courage to ask Lyusya to marry him.

Because Pechmarie is her real daughter, the widow clearly favors her and makes Goldmarie do all the work. Poor Goldmarie must also sit and spin all day by the well until her fingers bleed. When she tries to rinse out the spindel, it drops into the cold water. Her unsympathetic step-mother tells her to jump in after it. Goldmarie does as she is told, and then wakes up in the middle of a beautiful field of flowers. This is the land of Frau Holle, who welcomes Goldmarie and invites her to stay, as long as she will help with the housework. Marie stays and serves Frau Holle gladly, until she suffers so terribly from homesickness that she asks to go home. Before bringing her back, Frau Holle rewards Marie with a shower of gold. Upon her return, Goldmarie and her gold are welcomed by her greedy step-sister and -mother. Hoping for the same kind of reward, the step-mother sends Pechmarie to find Frau Holle. Unfortunately, Pechmarie is lazy and doesn't want to work for Frau Holle, despite the thought of her gold reward. After three days, Frau Holle has enough of her, and sends her back home.

The Barber of Stamford Hill,1963,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0168484/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Mr. Figg, the barber, is fond of telling customers about his family, but he hasn't really got one - he's a bachelor quite alone in the world. But that may change. Local barber Mr Figg (John Bennett) natters away to his clients, he fibs about his domestic life and imagines for himself a wife and children. After he lights the Sabbath candles one Friday evening, nostalgia for the warmth of his childhood home leads the Jewish bachelor to act on his fantasy. He takes a break from his regular chess evening with mute friend (Maxwell Shaw) Dober to pursue the hand of his neighbour Mrs Werner (Megs Jenkins) a busy and charming widow with two teenage children. Will family life meet Figg's high expectations? The film opens in Mr. Figg's barbershop in Stamford Hill, in which he discusses his family life with his customers. Upon his arrival home, however, it is revealed that he is a bachelor and his stories of family life are inventions he concocts because he believes they are what his customers want to hear. In fact, he lives on his own in a flat in Stepney and on Friday nights lights the Shabbat candles before his mute friend Dober comes to visit and they spend the evening eating and playing chess.
As he sits with Dober, Mr. Figg discusses his sadness at not having had a family and subsequently decides to propose to Mrs. Werner, a widowed neighbour with two children, so, leaving Dober in the flat, visits her in the hope of doing so. However, as he sits in her kitchen he is not only surprised by her admitting she does not follow Jewish tradition by lighting the candles but is unsure how to respond to domestic conflicts that take place between Mrs. Werner and her children, as her son noisily plays the drums in the front room and her daughter argues with her about being allowed to go out. Before he can get round to proposing, Mrs. Werner mentions that she recently received an offer of marriage from the local butcher only to laugh the idea off as preposterous, leading Mr. Figg to abandon his plan and return to his flat.
The film ends with Mr. Figg back in his barbershop, chatting to a customer and relating the story of Mrs Werner's son playing the drums as if it is a story about his own, fictional, family."

The Trip to Biarritz,1963,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0185752/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Guillaume Dodut is a station master who dreams of Biarritz, whose posters are spread over his platform, and of professional success for his son. But he postpones his vacation, preventing his father from going to Biarritz. Guillaume Dodut, station master of Puget-sur-Var, learns that the stop of the passenger train will be removed. He then remembers that even the ""Côte d'Argent"" which came from Paris stopped in its station, that his son stood in front of a very beautiful wagon and said to him ""by car for Biarritz"". Charles is now 25 years old and completed his engineering studies with an internship in London. He will find his father's station in the second category. After a whirlwind trip to London where he cannot even see his son, Guillaume learns on his return that he is arriving the next day. Little Thérèse, who works at the counter, will even be invited to the family table, because he wants her son to marry the ""little one"". But Charles had other plans in mind and put the little station in turmoil when he announced that he would live in London and that he would marry Marjorie, the daughter of his boss. The Provençal sun, Thérèse's smile and the father's grief will quickly overcome this fragile decision. After all, between Toulon and Fréjus, we must lack engineers and maybe the honeymoon, we will all do it in Biarritz, thinks Guillaume, who has found a smile again. Guillaume Dodut (Fernandel) is the stationmaster of the imaginary town of Puget-sur-Var. Every day, he sees the ""Côte d'Argent"", which serves the Biarritz line, pass by without stopping. Twenty years ago, he had promised his son Charles (Jacques Chabassol) that he would go to Biarritz: ""When you grow up..."". Guillaume has been dreaming about it ever since, and has read so many guidebooks and magazines that he knows the town inside out without ever having been there. One day, he learns that the last passenger train to stop at his station is going to be cancelled, due to competition from Louis' bus. His son also writes to tell him that he's finished his engineering internship in London and is about to go on vacation. His dream of going away could finally come true.
With the help of Fernande (Arletty), the owner of the Café de la gare, who has lived in Biarritz, Dodut makes his final travel arrangements.
Dodut, who hasn't heard from Charles after asking him when he'll be returning home, gets the chance to spend a day in London, thanks to Thérèse (Catherine Sola), who works at the station ticket office and had played the lottery for an English coffee brand using the stationmaster's name. But he can't see his son: he seems to be promised to his boss's daughter, and he doesn't want to be photographed with his father by the journalists present, as he's ashamed of his origins. During the night, Charles telegraphs his parents that he will arrive on Tuesday. Guillaume and Charles, in complicity, pretend to Madeleine (Hélène Tossy), their wife and mother, that they saw each other in London.
At the start of dinner, just as Guillaume is about to announce their departure for Biarritz, Charles learns from his boss's daughter that she will be spending the vacations with her parents in Biarritz - where the Dodut family is supposed to go regularly. Charles initially wants to go alone, claiming a professional obligation, but after dinner, he confesses everything to Thérèse (invited to the family table, as the Dodut parents know them to be very close), including the doubts he's had since his return, having rediscovered a great complicity with her. That evening, Guillaume makes the first mistake of his career, forgetting to stop a train. Thanks to Thérèse, he escapes a train driver's report in-extremis. During the night, Guillaume talks to his son about his sadness at not being able to make the trip he had dreamed of (without admitting it, preferring to say that Madeleine is disappointed).
With Fernande's help, Charles breaks down the bus to fill up for the train and make his father happy. He tells Thérèse that he won't be going to Biarritz and will be applying for an engineering job in Marseille. Seeing them embrace as the train pulls away, Guillaume Dodut finds himself smiling again."

Mohityanchi Manjula,1963,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0252726/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The year is 1654, and King Shivájí of Mahárásht.ra, India, is determined to annex the fortress of Jával.í. Bahirjí Náik, a master of disguise, gets the assignment. Meanwhile, a fearless and agile girl named Manjul.á Mohite becomes an object of obsession for Sir Kedárjí More of Jával.í, who attempts to kidnap her. Watch how Bahirjí and Manjul.á work together to frustrate Kedárjí and assimilate Jával.í into the independent kingdom in this epic film.—Muktak Aklujkar Mohityánchí Manjul.á is a fictional romance set in Mahárásht.ra, India, in the time of King Shivájí (Chandrakánt Mándre), a 17th-century hero legendary for his military cunning and his chivalry. Its protagonists are the historical Bahirjí Náik (Súryakánt Mándre), a master of disguise who is Shivájí's secret agent, and a fictional girl named Manjul.á (Jayashrí Gad.kar) of the noble Mohite family. The idealized Shivájí, Bahirjí and Manjul.á in this story stand for militant Hindu nationalism within the Mughal empire and for the protection of women's honour. These two themes alternate throughout the plot as Kedárjí (Rájá Pat.vardhan), a scion of the princely More clan that resists Shivájí's ambition to impose ""independence"" on their fortress of Jával.í, schemes to debauch and humiliate Manjul.á. The symbolic connection between female chastity and Hindu nationalism is established by Manjul.á's desire to dedicate her wifely virtue to an officer of Shivájí.The movie opens with the anthem, ""There may be many lands lovely, prosperous or grand, but the one dear to us is this Mahárásht.ra."" We are told (and then shown) that Kedárjí's cousin, Chandra Ráv More (Jayshankar Dánave), not only refused Shivájí's offer to annex Jával.í to his independent kingdom, he openly gave asylum to Rangú Vákad.e (Barchíbaháddar) whom Shivájí had sentenced to death for raping a widow. Shivájí declares that a delay in the annexation of Jával.í might be tolerated, but for the mockery of independence that a predator on women goes free.In the town of Bahirevád.í on the border of Shivájí's kingdom and Jával.í, at the festival of the God Bahirobá, Kedárjí's men are accosting women when Manjul.á strikes one of them, Gan.yá (Chittaranjan Kolhat.kar), with a whip. Kedárjí hears of this, and as Manjul.á exits the shrine, he rudely says her name. ""It's my mare's name. I was ordering a tight rein for her,"" he scoffs. Manjul.á retorts by calling to her elderly servant, ""Birájí! You forgot to give Kedárjí his hay today! - It's our bullock's name."" Manjul.á affronts Kedárjí again when she bests his champion in the fencing contest to vindicate Birájí's honour. In the evening, after two actors entertain the worshippers with magic tricks and philosophical riddles, Kedárjí wants to talk to Manjul.á, but she refuses, and he boasts that he will have her kidnapped. One of the actors (Súryakánt Mándre) asks Kedárjí for employment, and Kedárjí agrees to take him to Jával.í. The next morning, the actor overhears Kedárjí telling Gan.yá that he will make Manjul.á an offer of marriage just to punish her with a lifetime of drudgery and beatings.Manjul.á's matron friend Hamsá (Shántá Támbe) and her widowed aunt (Indirá Chit.n.ís) warn her that when the suitor comes to see her, she will have to hide her male attire, keep her gaze on the ground, and be quiet. Manjul.á says that she will change when she meets a real man. When she sees Kedárjí, she refuses to marry into the family that is sheltering the rapist Rangú Vákad.e, saying that she would rather marry an officer of Shivájí's army than a nobleman who quarrels with Shivájí. Kedárjí marches off furiously. In a moment, the actor shows up at the Mohite home and is welcomed for dinner. Manjul.á asks him why an able-bodied man like him isn't in Shivájí's army. He asks her why she refused Kedárjí, and when she replies that she would rather spend her life with an officer of Shivájí than as a bejewelled lady, he tells her to beware of Kedárjí.As Kedárjí seethes over Manjul.á's insult, the actor arrives, impressing Kedárjí with his disguise as an officer of the Mughal Emperor. He calls himself Daulatá Jádhav. Meanwhile, the other actor (Vasant Shinde), disguised as a limping cobbler named Chángad., snoops around Rangús residence. Rangú is terrified of assassins, but Kedárjí's uncle Han.amant (Báburáv Pen.d.hárkar) and Chandra Ráv dismiss his fears, even as the two actors resolve that if Rangú won't venture out, they must break in one way or another to get him.In a hillside cave, Daulatá meets a fellow spy disguised as a hermit, receives orders, and sends a report to Shivájí. He observes Kedárjí giving orders to some dacoits to kidnap Manjul.á that night. The two actors, disguised as a sick old man and his son, ask for shelter from Manjul.á's aunt. Daulatá plays tricks on Birájí by mimicking Manjul.á's voice, asking to be let in, and then the aunt's voice, crying ""Snake!"" As the dacoits enter the house, the actors assist Manjul.á in defending herself.Han.amant hears of the incident and admonishes Kedárjí for making deals with dacoits to violate a girl. Kedárjí pretends to listen, but immediately orders Gan.yá to kidnap Manjul.á. Gan.yá suggests that they trick her into marrying one of the servants, disguised as an officer of Shivájí, instead. Manjul.á's aunt is distraught over the possibility of another attempt to rape Manjul.á, but Manjul.á assures her that she is ready to marry even an officer of Shivájí. Kedárjí orders Daulatá to marry Manjul.á, and when he hesitates, throws him and Chángad. in jail. Chángad., who knows that Daulatá is in love with Manjul.á, finally persuades him to marry her. Manjul.á, disguised as a male cousin of the bride, recognizes her suitor, Officer Sarjá"" (Daulatá), as the actor and asks why an officer of Shivájí would be performing at fairs. Sarjá assures ""him"" that it is all part of the job, and ""he"" gives assurance that Manjul.á will not reject the proposal. As the women preparing for the wedding feast tease her about her husband, Manjul.á declares that he is a valiant Marát.há soldier. The marriage is solemnized, and Kedárjí remarks that time will tell whose wife Manjul.á is.Sarjá sets up his home in a village outside Jával.í (reacting angrily to Gan.yás suggestion that he and his wife should stay in the palace in Jával.í), and asks Kedárjí for a pass so that he can report for work without daily interrogation. Kedárjí gives him his family signet ring until he can get the pass from his uncle. Manjul.á is happy in her humble home, but taunts Sarjá that her brother-in-law (Chángad.) looks in on her every day, while Sarjá misses meals. Sarjá sends Chángad. off with reports for Shivájí, resisting his advice to divulge his real identity to Manjul.á and spend time with her. Disguised as a Muslim renunciate, he enters Han.amants mansion and notes the location of Rangús room. Reassuring Manjul.á that they will be together one night, he goes to the cave, but there he is arrested and taken before Shivájí, who reproaches him for neglecting his mission and getting married. Sarjá pleads for a last chance to prove himself, and Shivájí gives him two days to kill Rangú and breach Jával.ís defences, after which he will lay siege to the fort.Pretending to be Kedárjí, Sarjá knocks on Rangús door and kills him, even as Han.amant inquires from outside. Chandra Ráv is furious, but the assassin cannot be found. Kedárjí, seeking his signet ring (which Sarjá has given to Chángad.) before his uncle hears of the breach of security, surprises Manjul.á in her home, telling her that her husband is no officer of Shivájí but a servant of his own. Manjul.á throws him out, backed by the villagers, but when Chángad. recognizes Kedárjí, to her horror, Manjul.á realizes that Kedárjís boast is true: her husband is his servant, and a fraud! Chángad. pleads with Sarjá to tell Manjul.á the truth, but Sarjá is more concerned with preventing Han.amants supply of British cannons from reaching Jával.í. Manjul.á confronts Sarjá, and he admits that his name isnt Sarjá and he is Kedárjís servant.Chandra Ráv refuses to listen to Shivájís messengers. As they leave, Kedárjí reports that the cannons have been intercepted, and Han.amant sends him to spy on the messengers. When Kedárjí discovers the cave, the actor combats him, kills him, and takes his clothes. Manjul.á upbraids her husband, saying that she would do anything for him if he were not a servant of the More clan, and that she gave herself in marriage to an officer of Shivájí, a defender of womens honour. Refusing to return to her aunts house, she tells him that if she were not his wedded wife, she would bluntly tell him what he should do to redeem himself. Assuming Kedárjís identity, the actor is about to lead Kedárjís regiment away from Jával.í when Han.amant sees that his signet ring is missing and then, noticing that his eyes are not the right colour, has him thrown in jail. Dont let him go until you see the More signet ring.As Shivájís army besieges Jával.í, Han.amant arranges for boiling oil to pour on anyone who approaches the gates of the fort. Meanwhile, Chángad. uses the signet ring to free Kedárjí, and he leads his regiment away from the fort. As the guns and oil keep Shivájís army at bay, Manjul.á leaves her village and reaches Jával.í. Clutching her sword in her teeth, she swings from a tree onto the ramparts and fires a gun into the cauldron of oil, allowing the army to batter down the gates and take the fort. Later, finding Kedárjí at her door, she threatens to slice him in two, but he says, You would kill your own husband? Im not Mores servant, I never was! Tell me who you really are. Chángad. interrupts, and when Manjul.á drives him off, says, All right, Ill tell His Majesty that Bahirjí Náik wont leave his wife, and his wife wont let him go. Bahirjí hastily leaves as Manjul.á, overwhelmed with relief and pride, repeats the famous spys name over and over while Chángad. reminds her that Marát.há ladies dont say their husbands names.As Manjul.á, dressed up for the celebration of independence, awaits her husband in whatever disguise he chooses, Chángad. tells her that King Shivájí is on his way. Beware! I wont put up with anyone dressing up as His Majesty! exclaims Manjul.á, barring the door. Open up! calls Bahirjí. His Majesty is here! You cant manage to change your voice today? Manjul.á asks, opening the door to find Shivájí outside! Shivájí tells her, We have come here to commend you for your leadership. Girls like you are the evidence of piety in Mahárásht.ra. Shivájí declares Manjul.á his sister."

One lower-caste woman hides her male baby in a basket and sets it afloat.

He finds out about Amar's low-caste birth, complains to the Maharaja, who not only has Amar but also his biological mother as well as foster parents jailed. Amar is then pitted against several wrestlers but emerges victorious. Mantri then uses deceit by drugging him, has him chained, and used as a captive slave abroad a ship. When Mantri proposes marriage with Padma, the Maharaja refuses, and the former has him imprisoned, takes over the kingdom, and is all set to forcibly wed Padma.—rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com) In order to prevent a prophecy by his Raj-Jyotsi, the Maharaja sends his soldiers to kill every newborn child in the region. A lower-caste woman ('Ratnamala' (qv)) hides her male baby in a basket of vegetables and manages to bring him out of the village; heartbroken, she places her family necklace around his neck and sends the basket afloat down the river. Ranjit Singh ('Pravin Paul' (qv)), the childless wife of upper-caste Thakur Ranjit Singh ('Uma Dutt' (qv)) was just praying the gods to give her a child when the basket flows towards her. She promptly gets the baby, and telling her story to a disbelieving neighbour and then her husband, she raises the boy as her own son.Eighteen years later, the baby boy is a grown up muscle-man, Amar ('Dara Singh' (qv)) yet of a sensitive heart. He comes to blows with a handful of soldiers to prevent them killing a newborn white sheep, and next he proves to be also an excellent horseman when he follows the chariot of Rajkumari Padma ('Mumtaz' (qv)), and then pulls her out of a moving sands pit. The Maharaja is delighted that he saved his daughter, and hires Amar as a construction manager to his palace. Rajkumari Padma has fallen in love with Amar, much to the chagrin of Mantri ('Randhir' (qv) who wants to wed her - mostly because of his ambition for power.During an incident at the construction site, Amar's muscles come to good effect when he single-handedly took a heavy wood column off an old woman's legs. The woman sees the necklace he wears around his neck, and thus recognizes him as her son - but keeps quiet for his sake. But during a discussion at the palace, the foster mother is exposed by her neighbour as not being Amar's biological mother. Mantri is delighted to find that Amar is a low-caste, and complains to the Maharaja, demanding his arrest. Amar escapes the palace - after another struggle versus a number of soldiers - and goes searching for his real mother. But when he finds her, the soldiers arrest both, as Amar would not jeopardize her safety by engaging the soldiers in combat near her. They are sent to dungeon, along with the foster parents.Amar is paired with another strongman ('Randhawa' (qv)) to fight as a tag-team against a pair of the best wrestlers ('Wadib Ayoub' (qv) and 'Al-Rod Goa' (qv)) in honor of Captain Franko's arrival - a slave trader by profession. After a long and strenuous fight, Amar defeats one of his opponents, which does not go well with the Maharaja and Mantri, but leaves Rajkumari delighted. But there is an unexpected event: one of the wrestlers ('Al-Rod Goa' (qv)) considers that his honor is at stake, since no other man had defeated him in a wrestling match before, and defies Amar to a sword duel. The two men, still in their wrestling shorts, take up swords and shields and fight an even duel, until Amar's sword - ""prepared"" by Mantri's men - breaks under a direct strike from his opponent. Amar defends desperately with his shield, but then he loses that, too. It's with a wrestling move that he throws his on-rushing attacker against a post with protruding spears, and the man impales his chest on one of those deadly things.Later, Mantri then uses deceit and drugs Amar, in order to dispatch him with a number of others as a chained slave aboard Captain Franko's ship. The captives will make good use of Amar's herculean strength and their own ruses, in order to defeat a burly slave master ('King Kong' (qv)) and then take hold of the ship - after fighting Franko's crew hand-to-hand and with all sorts of blade weapons. Veena ('Minu Mumtaz' (qv)), a dancer in Franko's company, is about to lose her honor to the former slaves when Amar shows his good heart again, and protects her.[Color segment: Veena sings and dances for Amar on the ship, and everybody enjoys it.]Everybody fights for survival during a bad storm, and then the ship is adrift for a long time. When people are having delusions because of their thirst, they see a shore, and search desperately for water. They find some, but mostly they find natural dangers such as a giant spider, a giant lizzard, and a small snake. Meanwhile at the palace, Mantri proposes marriage to Padma, but she rejects him, and the Maharaja refuses anyway. Mantri does not want to wait any longer, and leads a palace coup, sends the Maharadja to the dungeon and takes over the kingdom. Now he will forcibly wed Padma.Amar and his crew of former slaves sail into another shore, and wants to befriend the inhabitants with a generous offer of jewels for food and water. The master of the place is Alberto ('Saudaghar Singh' (qv)) the bandits' leader, who shoves away the jewel box and prepares to take Veena instead. Amar objects to this, and Alberto defies him to a fight. Both men start taking off their clothes, but when Alberto sees Amar's powerful chest, he has second thoughts. Keeping his shirt on, he defies Amar to a sword duel instead. They fight yet another long duel that has both men going out of the tavern and through the rocks and the sea-shore. Amar wins the duel, but instead of plunging his sword through Alberto's guts, he plunges it in the sand. Alberto accepts the new friendship, and his bandits join the slaves for the good cause. Because Veena had received a message from their homeland, via a white pigeon, and they prepare to take on the usurper.A handful of bandits enter the palace disguised as a circus troop, and they surprise Mantri, forcing him to take them to the dungeon at dagger's point, from where they free all of Amar's parents.[Color film from here to The End.] Veena and a bandit girl ('Kathana' (qv)) sing and dance at the bandits' cove. Alberto is wounded at the shore by the soldiers, when fighting an uneven battle, but manages to escape on a small boat and reach his companions at the cove. Amar gets to the palace, trying to free Padma, but again he is arrested.During the wedding ceremonies, the usurper offers a show of arrow-men with the topless Amar as target on the arena. The first arrow plunges into the chest of Veena - who managed to run into the arena, sacrificing herself for Amar. Her sacrifice gave Amar the extra seconds he needed to break his chains, and then all hell broke loose. Not only Amar's friends but the people at large revolt against Mantri's soldiers and there are fights everywhere. Padma is about to be tortured by a burly executioner ('King Kong' in a dual role) in the dungeon, and the Maharadja is wounded to save Padma's life. After long sword duels, Amar prevails over Mantri and his faithful, and in a hand-to-hand fight, he also prevails over the executioner. Then, the Maharadja is ready to accept Amar to depart with his loving Patma."

The Other Christopher,1963,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0309967/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The dictator Anastasio rules with an iron fist backed by business-men making deals and speeches about building canals, completely disconnected from the chaos amongst the population. Anastasio is rumored to have died after an incident with a mirror and a violent confrontation after literally crowing as a cock amongst his chicken followers. The afterlife is shown as a casino where Anastasio strong-arms his way into heaven. Divination is used to find the next dictator, and a sailor and his black, peasant sidekick find themselves attempting to start a revolution with an organ, dragging it through the countryside, as the movie explores the country, culture and music. They attempt to trade with a flattened poster of a traditional family woman as well as a younger shrew, and encounter innocence in the form of a virgin. The war escalates into mythical proportions between heaven and hell in astonishing surreal sets involving dinosaur bones, stagy cages, huge pinball games and a bullfighting show, as well as rich countryside shots of a peasant uprising. Bombs fall from heaven and storms are brought about by a dictator in a bull costume using a fire-hose. An inexplicably obscure, surreal French-Cuban production on the Cuban revolution that predates Jodorowsky with its delirious and bizarre visuals. Filmed by Armand Gatti, a playwright with ties to Monaco and France who worked with Chris Marker and was imprisoned in a camp during WWII for anti-fascist activities. This is a satire with free-form surrealism, symbolism and absurdities.—Anonymous"
