Set 30 years after its predecessor, it follows Maverick's return to the United States Navy Strike Fighter Tactics Instructor program (also known as U.S. Navy-Fighter Weapons School - ""TOPGUN""), where he must confront his past as he trains a group of younger pilots, among them the son of Maverick's deceased best friend Lieutenant Nick ""Goose"" Bradshaw, USN.—Wrathzo After more than thirty years of service, military awards, medals and decorations for extraordinary heroism in combat, distinguished US Navy Captain Pete Mitchell, call sign Maverick, finds himself exactly where he belongs: pushing the limits as a top test pilot. Having spent years avoiding promotions after the events ofTop Gun (1986), Maverick must now confront the ugly past and an uncertain future while tasked with training the next generation of elite fighter pilots for a nearly impossible suicide mission. As the veteran naval aviator prepares the brilliant graduates for the top-secret assignment, stretching the rules to the breaking point, Mitchell has to face an equally critical challenge: navigate through an uncomfortable relationship with a hotshot lieutenant holding a grudge. Can Maverick and his Top Guns perform a miracle, give the enemy hell, and come back home in one piece?—Nick Riganas After more than 30 years of service as one of the Navy's top aviators, Pete ""Maverick"" Mitchell is where he belongs, pushing the envelope as a courageous test pilot and dodging the advancement in rank that would ground him. Training a detachment of graduates for a special assignment, Maverick must confront the ghosts of his past and his deepest fears, culminating in a mission that demands the ultimate sacrifice from those who choose to fly it.—krmanirethnam More than 30 years after graduating fromTop Gun (1986), United States Navy Captain Pete ""Maverick"" Mitchell is a test pilot. Despite many achievements, repeated insubordination has kept him from flag rank; his friend and former Top Gun rival, Admiral Tom ""Iceman"" Kazansky, now commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet, often protects Maverick. Rear Admiral Chester ""Hammer"" Cain plans to cancel Maverick's hypersonic ""Darkstar"" scramjet program in favor of funding drones. To save the program, Maverick unilaterally changes the target speed for that day's test from Mach 9 to the final contract specification of Mach 10. However, the prototype is destroyed when he cannot resist pushing beyond Mach 10. Iceman again saves Maverick's career by assigning him to the Top Gun school at NAS North Island for his next assignment, but Cain tells Maverick that the era of crewed fighter aircraft will soon be over.The Navy has been tasked with destroying an unsanctioned uranium enrichment plant, located in an underground bunker at the end of a canyon, before it becomes operational. It is defended by surface-to-air missiles (SAMs), GPS jammers, and fifth-generation Su-57 fighters as well as older F-14 Tomcats. Maverick devises a plan employing two pairs of F/A-18E/F Super Hornets armed with laser-guided bombs, but instead of participating in the strike, he is to train an elite group of Top Gun graduates assembled by Air Boss Vice Admiral Beau ""Cyclone"" Simpson.Maverick dogfights his skeptical students and prevails in every contest, winning their respect. Lieutenants Jake ""Hangman"" Seresin and Bradley ""Rooster"" Bradshaw-son of Maverick's dead best friend and RIO Nick ""Goose"" Bradshaw-clash: Rooster dislikes Hangman's cavalier attitude, while Hangman criticizes Rooster's cautious flying. Maverick reunites with former girlfriend Penny Benjamin, to whom he reveals that he promised Rooster's dying mother that Rooster would not become a pilot. Rooster, unaware of the promise, angrily resents Maverick for dropping his Naval Academy application-impeding his military career-and blames him for his father's death. Maverick is reluctant to further interfere with Rooster's career, but the alternative is to send him on the extremely dangerous mission. He tells his doubts to Iceman, who has terminal throat cancer. Iceman advises that ""It's time to let go"" and reassures him that both the Navy and Rooster need Maverick.After Iceman dies, Cyclone removes Maverick as instructor following a training incident in which an F/A-18F is lost. Cyclone relaxes the mission parameters, so they are easier to execute but make escape much more difficult. During Cyclone's announcement, Maverick makes an unauthorized flight through the course with his preferred parameters, proving that it can be done. Cyclone reluctantly appoints Maverick as team leader.Maverick flies the lead F/A-18E, accompanied by a buddy lazing F/A-18F[c] flown by Lieutenant Natasha ""Phoenix"" Trace and WSO Lieutenant Robert ""Bob"" Floyd. Rooster leads the second strike pair, which includes Lieutenant Reuben ""Payback"" Fitch and WSO Lieutenant Mickey ""Fanboy"" Garcia. The four jets launch from an aircraft carrier, and Tomahawk cruise missiles destroy the nearby air base as they approach. The teams destroy the plant, but the SAMs open fire during their escape, as anticipated. Rooster runs out of countermeasures, and Maverick sacrifices his plane to protect him. Believing Maverick to be dead, the others are ordered back to the carrier, but Rooster returns to find that Maverick ejected and is being targeted by an Mi-24 attack helicopter. After destroying the gunship, Rooster is shot down by a SAM and ejects. The two rendezvous and steal an F-14 from the damaged air base. Maverick and Rooster destroy two intercepting Su-57s, but a third attacks as they run out of ammunition and countermeasures. Hangman arrives in time to shoot it down, and the planes return safely.Later, Rooster helps Maverick work on his P-51 Mustang. Rooster looks at a photo of their mission's success, pinned alongside a photo of his late father and a young Maverick, as Penny and Maverick fly off in the P-51."

Once a familiar threat returns to finish what was previously started, Jake must work with Neytiri and the army of the Na'vi race to protect their home. Several years after the Na'vi repelled the RDA invasion Jake Sully and his family are living on Pandora. Things seem peaceful but the RDA has other plans, invading and capturing Pandora. Sully forms a guerrilla group to try to expel the invaders.—grantss Pandora, 2170. Having found meaning and purpose in the heart of the extrasolar Garden of Eden, formerly paraplegic Marine veteran Jake Sully and his fierce warrior princess companion Neytiri enjoy peace and prosperity after the life-altering events ofAvatar (2009). But happiness is fleeting. And when the unsightly ghosts of Sully's past emerge, sixteen years after the all-out Assault on the Tree of Souls, the human Toruk Makto and the Na'vi must fight back. Now, Jake and the Omatikaya clan have no choice but to pick up where they left off to defend their home. In the upcoming war against the unstoppable Sky People, will blind revenge destroy everything Sully holds dear?—Nick Riganas Over a decade after the events of the first film, the film begins with Jake Sully narrating his modest and peaceful life as Chief of the Omaticaya Clan and raising a family with his wife Neytiri, which includes his sons Neteyam and Lo'ak and his daughter Tuk, his adopted daughter Kiri (born from Grace Augustine's comatose Na'vi avatar), and a human boy named Spider, the son of Miles Quaritch who was born on Pandora but was unable to be transported to Earth in cryostasis as an infant. While Jake is able to accept Spider as an adopted son, Neytiri is distrustful of him given his human origins. However, all the children mingle and socialize well with each other including Spider, whom Kiri is affectionate with even though he is a human. Spider does not embrace his human heritage and feels more inclined to Na'vi culture and traditions. They lead a normal life until one day they notice a strange star in the night sky. Much to their dismay, they realize its a RDA space-ship with humans returning to Pandora to colonize it, erecting a new main operating base yet again, causing significant destruction to Pandora. Among the new arrivals in the ship is Colonel Quaritch, who has been cloned into a Na'vi body and with his memories uploaded from before his death. As a result, Quaritch is unable to remember his demise at the hands of Jake but is only able to recollect the events in the past and his vengeful mission to eliminate Jake.To prevent the RDA from exploiting Pandora again, Jake leads a strategic guerrilla operation against the RDA supply lines weakening them. In one of the operations, Lo'ak who disobeys Neteyam and is eager to prove himself as a Na'vi warrior, tries to assist Jake in battle but is wounded. Jake rescues and disciplines him to not endanger his own safety by being reckless. That night, while tending to his wounds, Neytri calmly reminds Jake to be not too hard on Lo'ak, to which Jake expresses his concern as a father for the safety of his children. Meanwhile, the retaliatory strike on the RDA supply lines doesn't sit well with Quaritch who initiates a search mission to kill Jake. During a playful venture, Jake's children along with Spider explore deeper into the rainforest. Unbeknownst to them, Quaritch and his team are in the vicinity exploring the site where Quaritch discovers his human remains. An observant Lo'ak notices their presence and quickly informs Jake. A skirmish ensues and Quaritch's squad captures Jake's children. Jake and Neytiri arrive in time and free most of them, but Spider is taken by Quaritch, who recognizes him as his son. Aboard the ship, the RDA tries to coerce information about Jake from Spider whom refuses. Changing strategy, Quaritch addresses Spider as his son and also to explain more about the Na'vi in exchange for his freedom on his side. Although un-cooperative and unaware of Quaritch's actual mission, Spider teaches Quaritch about Na'vi culture. Quaritch is also successfully able to tame an Ikran flying creature as his vehicle.Knowing the danger Spider's knowledge of his whereabouts poses to their safety and also to avoid another catastrophe, Jake convinces a reluctant Neytri and his family to banish themselves from the Omaticaya Clan and retreat to the eastern seaboard of Metkayina, a coral reef island whose clan and lifestyle is adapted to Pandora's aquatic habitat. Jake passes on his chief mantle to his successor and leaves together with his family to Metkayina. Once arrived, they are greeted by the clan chief Tonowari and his wife Ronal who is doubtful of them initially. However, Jake explains their situation and they are agreed to stay and given shelter. Even though some tribesmen deride Jake and his children for their genetic human heritage, the family learns the ways of the reef people earning the respect of them. Kiri is fascinated with the aquatic life of Metkayina and develops a spiritual bond with the sea and its creatures, while Lo'ak befriends Tsireya, the daughter of clan chief Tonowari and his wife Ronal.While adapting to their new environment, Lo'ak gets into a fight with Tsireya's brother Aonung when he makes a crude joke about Kiri and him of their mixed human lineage. Jake admonishes his son for his behavior. At Jake's insistence, Lo'ak returns to apologize to Aonung and his friends. However, they entice him to a trip into the territory of a dangerous sea predator, the akula, and leave him stranded in revenge. The akula tries to attack Lo'ak. However, Lo'ak is saved by and befriends Payakan, a tulkun, an intelligent and pacifistic cetacean species whom the Metkayina consider their spiritual family. Lo'ak is able to communicate with Payakan through signing and removes an old harpoon head from the beast's right fin. Upon his return to Metkayina, Chief Tonowari, who became aware of Aonung's tricking of Lo'ak, asks the former to apologize to Lo'ak, However, Lo'ak takes the blame himself, winning Aonung's friendship. He is also told that Payakan is an outcast among his species. Meanwhile, on a trip to an offshoot of the Tree of Souls, Kiri links with it to meet her mother, but suffers a violent seizure. She is healed by Ronal, but when Jake calls Norm Spellman and Max Patel for help, Quaritch is able to track them to the archipelago where the reef people live. Bringing Spider with him, he commandeers a whaling vessel which is hunting tulkuns to harvest their brain enzymes for creating anti-aging remedies. Quaritch begins to brutally question the indigenous tribes about Jake's location; failing that, he orders the whaling crew to wantonly kill the tulkuns in order to draw Jake out. Lo'ak mentally links with Payakan and learns that the tulkun was cast out because he went against the ways of his species and attacked the whalers who killed his mother.When the Metkayina learn of the tulkun slaughters, Lo'ak takes off to warn Payakan. He is followed by Neteyam, Tsireya, Roxto, and Aonung. Kiri and Tuk spot them and join. They find Payakan being chased by the whalers, and Lo'ak, Tsireya, and Tuk are captured by Quaritch. Kiri, Roxto, and Anoung managed to escape capture. Informed that their children in danger, Jake, Neytiri and the Metkayina set out to confront the humans. Quaritch forces Jake to surrender; but seeing his soul brother imperiled, Payakan attacks the whalers, triggering a fight which kills most of the crew and critically damages the vessel, causing it to sink. Neteyam rescues Lo'ak and Spider, but is fatally shot. Jake faces Quaritch, who uses Kiri as a hostage. When Neytiri does the same with Spider, Quaritch at first denies his son, but desists when Neytiri cuts Spider on the chest.Jake, Quaritch, Neytiri and Tuk end up trapped inside the sinking vessel. Jake strangles Quaritch into unconsciousness and is rescued by Lo'ak and Payakan, and Kiri summons sea creatures to help her save Neytiri and Tuk. Spider finds and rescues Quaritch, but leaves him due to his cruelty towards the Na'vi and putting his goal to kill Jake's family over being his father and becoming a good man, leading him back to rejoin Jake's family. After Neteyam's funeral, Jake and his family decide to stay with the Metkayina permanently."
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,2022,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9114286/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The people of Wakanda fight to protect their home from intervening world powers as they mourn the death of King T'Challa.

But one year after the death of King T'Challa, the country faces yet another threat. This time, King Namor, the mutant leader of an unstoppable oceanic warrior race, is determined to protect the hidden underwater kingdom of Talokan from the surface world at all costs. And as the invaders' suffocating stranglehold tightens, Wakanda must prepare to fight--with or without its valiant defender.—Nick Riganas T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman), king of Wakanda, is dying from an unspecified terminal illness which his sister Shuri (Letitia Wright) (The princess of Wakanda who designs new technology for the nation) believes can be cured by the ""heart-shaped herb"". Shuri attempts to synthetically recreate the herb after it was destroyed by Erik Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan), but fails to do so before T'Challa dies.One year later, Wakanda is under pressure from other nations to share their Vibranium, with some parties attempting to steal it by force. Queen Ramonda (Angela Bassett) (The Sovereign Queen regnant of Wakanda who is grieving the death of her son T'Challa) implores Shuri to continue her research on the herb, hoping to create a new Black Panther that will defend Wakanda, but she refuses due to her belief that the Black Panther is a figure of the past.
In the Atlantic Ocean, the CIA and U.S. Navy SEALs utilize a Vibranium detector to locate a potential Vibranium deposit underwater. The expedition is killed by a group of blue-skinned, water-breathing super-humans led by Namor (Tenoch Huerta Mejía) (The king of Talokan, an ancient civilization of underwater dwelling people. Namor decides to get involved in the surface world after T'Challa publicly reveals the truth of Wakanda at the end of the first film, which consequently puts Talokan in ""jeopardy"", leading Namor and his people to ""take action to protect themselves""), with the CIA believing Wakanda to be responsible.
Namor confronts Ramonda and Shuri, easily bypassing Wakanda's advanced security. Blaming Wakanda for the Vibranium race, he gives them an ultimatum: deliver him the scientist responsible for the Vibranium detector, or he will attack Wakanda. Namor claims to have a massive army with incomparable strength.Shuri and Okoye (Danai Gurira) (The general of the Dora Milaje, Wakanda's all-female special forces) learn from CIA agent Everett K. Ross (Martin Freeman) that the scientist in question is MIT student Riri Williams (Dominique Thorne) (An MIT student and genius inventor from Chicago who creates a suit of armor that rivals the one built by Tony Stark / Iron Man) and arrive at the university to confront her. Shuri tells Everett that Wakanda had nothing to do with the attack on the mining expedition.
The group is pursued by the FBI and then by Namor's warriors, who defeat Okoye before taking Shuri and Williams underwater to meet Namor. Angered by Okoye's failure to protect Shuri, Ramonda strips her of her title as general of the Dora Milaje (and for siding with the KillMonger when he took over the throne of Wakanda) and seeks out Nakia (Lupita Nyong'o) (A former War Dog, an undercover spy for Wakanda, from the River Tribe), who has been living in Haiti since The BlipRamonda contacts Everett, but refuses to divulge that it was Namor who abducted Riri. Everett and the CIA believes that it was the Wakandans again.Namor shows Shuri his Vibranium-rich underwater kingdom of Talokan, which he has protected for centuries from discovery by the world. Namor says that he comes from the Yucatan peninsula. In 1571 AD, the Spanish conquistadors brought disease and war. Their shaman was given a vision of a different world, and led to a blue plant growing in a rock. The shaman takes the plant and grinds it into a paste, that is taken by all natives, including Namor's mother who was pregnant at the time. The plant took away their ability to breathe air, but gave them the ability to draw oxygen from water. Namor was born in the water and the plant gave him wings on his ankles and ears that pointed to the clouds. He was a mutant.
Namor returned to bury his mother in her homeland and killed the European settlers. The Christian priest calls him a demon, a child without love, or Namor.
Nakia tracks down Shuri to the same spot where the shaman entered the water world for the first time.Bitter at the surface world for enslaving the Maya, Namor proposes an alliance with Wakanda against the rest of the world but threatens to destroy Wakanda if they refuse. Nakia helps Shuri and Williams escape, killing a Talokanil guard in the process, and Namor retaliates with an attack against Wakanda, during which Ramonda drowns while saving Williams. Namor vows to return with his full army in one week's time, and the citizens of Wakanda relocate to the Jabari mountains for their safety.
Meanwhile, Ross is arrested by his ex-wife, CIA director Valentina Allegra De Fontaine (Julia Louis-Dreyfus), for secretly exchanging classified intelligence with the Wakandans.After Ramonda's funeral, Shuri uses a remnant of the herb that gave Namor's people their superhuman abilities to reconstruct the heart-shaped herb. She was able to do this with the bracelet that Namor gifted her, which contained the remnant of the plant that their Shaman had found in 1571 AD. Together Riri and Shuri figure out that Namor derives his strength from the water. He can be weakened if dried out.
She ingests it, gaining superhuman abilities (but going into cardiac arrest in the process) and meeting Killmonger in the Ancestral Plane, who urges her to seek revenge. Shuri dons a new Black Panther suit and is accepted by the other Wakandan tribes as the Black Panther. Despite M'Baku's (Winston Duke) (A powerful warrior and leader of Wakanda's mountain tribe, the Jabari) urges for peace, Shuri is determined to exact vengeance on Namor for Ramonda's death and orders an immediate counterattack on Talokan. Preparing for battle, with Ayo assuming the position of general of the Dora Milaje, Shuri bestows the Midnight Angel armor upon Okoye, who in turn recruits Dora Milaje member Aneka (Michaela Coel) (A Wakandan warrior and member of the Dora Milaje) to join her. Williams creates an Iron Man like powered exoskeleton to aid the Wakandans.Using a seafaring vessel, the Wakandans lure Namor and his warriors to the surface with another Vibranium detector as a battle ensues. Shuri traps Namor in a fighter aircraft, intending to dry him out and weaken him. The pair crash on a desert beach and fight. Shuri gains the upper hand, but has a vision of Ramonda and implores Namor to yield, offering him a peaceful alliance.
Namor accepts, and the battle ends. Namor's cousin, Namora (Mabel Cadena), is upset at Namor's surrender, but he assures her that the new alliance will allow them to conquer the surface world one day. Williams returns to MIT, leaving her suit behind, while Okoye rescues Ross from captivity. Shuri plants more heart-shaped herbs to ensure the future of the Black Panther mantle. In Shuri's absence, M'Baku steps forward to challenge for the throne. Shuri visits Nakia in Haiti where she burns her funeral robe in accordance with Ramonda's wishes, allowing herself to finally grieve for T'Challa.In a mid-credits scene, Shuri learns that Nakia and T'Challa had a son named Toussaint, whom Nakia has been raising in secret. Toussaint reveals his Wakandan name is T'Challa."

They seek help from Wanda the Scarlet Witch, Wong and others. Following the events of Spider-Man No Way Home, Doctor Strange unwittingly casts a forbidden spell that accidentally opens up the multiverse. With help from Wong and Scarlet Witch, Strange confronts various versions of himself as well as teaming up with the young America Chavez while traveling through various realities and working to restore reality as he knows it. Along the way, Strange and his allies realize they must take on a powerful new adversary who seeks to take over the multiverse.—Blazer346 Bizarre visions of a mysterious teenage girl stranded in an unfamiliar dimension haunt Dr Stephen Strange shortly after the events ofSpider-Man: No Way Home (2021)andEternals (2021). Indeed, a lot has changed sinceDoctor Strange (2016). But when Strange encounters the extraordinary girl from his dreams, the delicate boundaries between the current reality and an unfathomable alternate world start to collapse. Before long, horrific creatures working for nefarious forces wreak chaos, fusing parallel universes into a dangerous reality. Can Sorcerer Supreme Wong and invincible Wanda Maximoff help Strange stop the new adversary before the Multiverse of Madness consumes everything?—Nick Riganas Shortly after the events of ""Spider-Man: No Way Home"", Doctor Strange has been having unusual dreams about a young teenage girl with the ability to open inter dimensional portals. Strange soon learns that America Chavez is the teenager with that ability. In order to learn more about the multiverse, Strange decides to enlist Wanda, who has been in hiding since the Westview incident in ""WandaVision"". But Stephen soon learns that Wanda has studied the Dark Hold and she is fixated on obtaining America's powers so that she can reunite with her children in a different universe. Stephen's effort on protecting America leads to them being stranded on Earth-838. Stephen decides to rely on an alternate version of Christine Palmer on getting the Book of Vishanti, which is located in the gap junction, so that America can have better control over her powers, but at the same time Stephen must figure out how to free Wanda from the Dark Hold before she destroys the multiverse.—dawsonpersi America Chavez (Xochitl Gomez) (A teenager who has the ability to travel between dimensions by punching open doorways) and a version of Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) (A neurosurgeon who became a Master of the Mystic Arts following a career-ending car accident) are chased by a demon in the space between universes while searching for the Book of Vishanti. That Strange is killed and Chavez accidentally creates a portal that transports herself and Strange's corpse to Earth-616, where that universe's version of Strange rescues Chavez from another demon with help from the Sorcerer Supreme, Wong (Benedict Wong) (The Sorcerer Supreme of Earth-616 and Strange's mentor and friend). Chavez explains that the beings are hunting her because she has the power to travel through the multiverse. She cant control her powers and it manifests only when she is really frightened.
Chavez says that the other Strange reached the book of Vishanti (which would give him the powers to defeat the demon), but that's when the Demon caught up with them and killed Strange. Chavez shows them the dead Strange's corpse as proof.Recognizing witchcraft runes, Strange consults Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen) (A former Avenger gone rogue who can harness chaos magic, engage in telepathy and telekinesis, and alter reality) for help but realizes that she is responsible for the attacks. After acquiring the Darkhold (the book of the damned that corrupts everyone) and becoming the Scarlet Witch, Maximoff believes that controlling Chavez's powers will allow her to reunite (by travelling to a different Universe, where they are still alive) with Billy (Julian Hilliard) and Tommy (Jett Klyne), the children she created during her time in Westview.Maximoff gives an ultimatum to surrender Chavez by sundown. When Strange refuses to surrender Chavez, Maximoff attacks Kamar-Taj, killing many sorcerers. Under stress, Chavez accidentally transports herself and Strange to Earth-838 (from where she cant go back as she cant control her powers. CHavez herself doesn't have a counterpart in any other universe) while Maximoff uses the Darkhold to ""dream-walk"" (Projecting her consciousness into her alternate from any other Universe), taking control of her Earth-838 counterpart, who lives a suburban life with her own Billy and Tommy. A surviving sorceress sacrifices herself to destroy the Darkhold and break the dream-walk. Enraged, Maximoff forces Wong to lead her to Mount Wundagore, the source of the Darkhold's power, to reestablish the dream-walk.
There Maximoff realizes that Wundagore is a throne that has been waiting for her arrival. She was meant to rule all the multiverses.While searching for help, Strange and Chavez are apprehended by Earth-838's Sorcerer Supreme, Karl Mordo (Chiwetel Ejiofor) (In this Universe Strange died trying to protect the Earth from Thanos), and brought before the Illuminati, a group consisting of Mordo, Peggy Carter / Captain Carter (Hayley Atwell), Blackagar Boltagon / Black Bolt (Anson Mount), Maria Rambeau / Captain Marvel (Lashana Lynch), Reed Richards (John Krasinski) (A member of the Fantastic 4), and Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart).
They explain that through reckless use of their universe's Darkhold in an attempt to defeat Thanos, Earth-838's Strange triggered a universe-destroying ""incursion"" (when boundaries between 2 universes are blurred, they collide, destroying one of both of the universes). After defeating Thanos (They found the book of Vishanti and used its powers to kill Thanos), the Illuminati executed their Strange to prevent him from causing more harm.Mordo believes that Earth-616's Strange is similarly dangerous, but Maximoff reestablishes her dream-walk at Mount Wundagore and arrives in her Earth-838 counterpart's body before they can pass judgment. She kills all of the Illuminati except Mordo, whom Strange subdues before fleeing with Chavez. The two escape with help from the Earth-838 counterpart of Strange's ex-fiance, Christine Palmer (Rachel McAdams) (An emergency surgeon who was a colleague and lover of Strange), a scientist working with the Illuminati. Before dying Xavier had told Strange that 838 had the book of Vishanti. Strange convinces Palmer to take him to the way-point that leads to the book of Vishanti.Strange, Chavez and Palmer enter the space between universes to find the Book of Vishanti, which is the antithesis to the Darkhold, but Maximoff appears and destroys it. She then takes over Chavez's mind, using her powers to send the others to an incursion-destroyed universe. She also uses Chavez to send her back to Earth 616, where Maximoff disconnects the dream-walk with her 838 self.Strange defeats the destroyed universe's Strange, who has been corrupted by his universe's Darkhold, and uses it to dream-walk into the body of his deceased counterpart on Earth-616. With Wong's help, Strange saves Chavez from Maximoff as she tries to take Chavez's powers, and encourages Chavez to use her abilities. She transports Maximoff to Earth-838, where she sees Billy and Tommy recoil from her (the Wanda 616 who was in SCarlett witch headgear) in fear while crying for their real mother (whom Wanda 616 tossed aside when she entered the 616 universe). Realizing the error of her ways, Maximoff-616 relents and uses her powers to bring down Mount Wundagore, simultaneously destroying all copies of the Darkhold throughout the multiverse and apparently sacrificing herself in the process. Chavez returns Strange and Palmer to their respective universes.Sometime later, Kamar-Taj is repaired and the surviving sorcerers, joined by Chavez, continue training. Strange develops a third eye as a result of using the Darkhold and dream-walking into a corpse.In a mid-credits scene: Strange is approached by a sorceress who warns him that his actions have triggered an incursion that he must help fix. Strange follows her into the Dark Dimension."

News coverage also notes that Maisie Lockwood (Isabella Sermon) has disappeared after her true nature as a clone was made public.At a facility in Nevada, Claire Dearing (Bryce Dallas Howard) and Zia Rodriguez (Daniella Pineda) save a baby dinosaur from an illegal breeding site. They join Franklin Webb (Justice Smith) as they escape in a van, but security guards chase after them until the three manage to lose them. Franklin and Zia tell Claire they can no longer keep this type of work up, and while they support Claire and her endeavors, they are moving onto jobs that are safer for them.Somewhere near the snowy mountains in Nevada, Owen Grady (Chris Pratt) is riding a horse to wrangle a large dinosaurs. After he's done, he goes back to the cabin that he shares with Claire and Maisie, as he and Claire are now her adoptive parents. Although Maisie likes to stray from home and witness the dinosaurs on land, Claire and Owen try to keep her hidden for fear that someone is after her. This causes her to get annoyed with them, and she has also become curious about Charlotte Lockwood, whom she was cloned from. Sure enough, mercenaries led by Rainn Delacourt (Scott Haze) are spying on them in the woods, Maisie being their target.Not far from the cabin, Blue the raptor has asexually reproduced a child (who Maisie later names Beta). They go hunting together.In Texas, two children are chased by an enormous swarm of locusts. This is brought to the attention of paleobotanist Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern). She investigates the farm where the locusts attacked and ate up all the crops. Ellie is told by the children's mother that the neighboring crops, which were untouched by the locusts, are planted by BioSyn.Ellie reunites with Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill), who is working with other aspiring paleontologists. She brings a captured locust to him and explains the situation, fearing that if they spread, they may wreck the food chain. Alan and Ellie figure that BioSyn must have made them so that their crops are all that remains. Ellie wants to get DNA from another locust at the BioSyn sanctuary and asks for Alan's help. She was already invited by their old friend, Dr. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum). Despite showing some hesitance, Alan ultimately agrees to join.Back at the cabin, Blue and Beta come upon Owen, Claire, and Maisie. They are all surprised to see Blue has become a mother. The mercenaries soon make their move and capture Beta. Maisie rides her bike across the bridge and is also taken by the villains. Owen sees this and gets Claire to go after them. Claire says she knows who can help them.Claire contacts Franklin, who now works for the CIA. He helps them get info on Delacourt and points them to Owen's former coworker at Jurassic World, Barry Sembene (Omar Sy), who can help take them to wherever the mercenaries are taking Maisie and Beta.Alan and Ellie arrive at the sanctuary and meet Ramsay Cole (Mamoudou Athie), BioSyn's Head of Communications. He introduces them to Dodgson, who promises they are working on something revolutionary and groundbreaking. Alan and Ellie are escorted to find Ian giving a lecture. Afterwards, he joins them and discreetly tells Ellie that the locusts are indeed part of a sinister scheme by BioSyn. Meanwhile, Dodgson meets with Dr. Henry Wu (BD Wong), who has since become remorseful of his actions in helping keep these experiments going, as he notes that the locusts have grown at an alarming rate.In Malta, an associate of Dodgson's, Sonoya Santos (Dichen Lachman), calls him to say that Maisie and Beta have been transported separately to BioSyn HQ. Owen and Claire also arrive and reunite with Barry. He brings them to a black market dinosaur ring, where animals are being sold, eaten, or forced to fight. Claire meets Kayla Watts (DeWanda Wise), a pilot who flies for the vendors. She warns Claire about messing with anyone there, but eventually agrees to help Claire find Maisie. As this happens, Owen and Barry stay hidden and witness Delacourt meeting with Santos to smuggle Atrociraptors. The two confront and fight Delacourt and his men. Owen orders him to say where Maisie and Beta are, and he just gives him Santos' name before he gets eaten by dinosaurs in the fighting ring. Claire fights Santos and learns that Maisie is headed for BioSyn, and she outruns a loose dinosaur before joining Kayla. Barry arrests Santos, but not before she sics one of her dinosaurs on Owen, who is riding a motorcycle to catch up with Claire and Kayla. He manages to board Kayla's plane just as she is getting ready to take off with Claire, and Owen uses the motorcycle to knock the dino off the ramp and into the ocean.Maisie arrives at HQ and meets Wu. He explains to her that while she is a clone of Charlotte's, she is also her actual daughter because she gave birth to her. Maisie watches video footage of Charlotte (Elva Trill), and sees when she was pregnant with Maisie. Charlotte suffered from a genetic disease, but she managed to alter Maisie's DNA to remove all traces of the disease. Wu hopes that by studying Maisie's DNA, he can reverse the locust outbreak by altering their DNA.Alan and Ellie sneak into the containment room for the locusts to get a DNA sample, just as Maisie tries to escape with Beta. Dodgson sounds the alarm, which causes the locusts to swarm around Alan and Ellie, but they manage to get out safely. They meet Maisie, who knows who they are. She joins them as they run. They are found by Ramsay, who agrees to help them because he finds BioSyn's work to be unethical. He sends them away in a monorail to safety. Ellie tells Maisie that she knew Charlotte as a student, and says she was a brilliant and kind person.In the air, Kayla's plane is attacked by a real Quetzalcoatlus, forcing Claire to eject and fall into the trees after they rip her parachute. Owen and Kayla crash into a nearby ice lake. They attempt to safely make their way across it but are chased by another dinosaur. The two make it across just in time and head off to relocate Claire. She gets down from the tree but has to quietly evade a Pyroraptor that has been stalking her in the forest. Owen and Kayla hide as the T-Rex makes her appearance to eat, but she is held off by a Smurfette's DNA called Giganotosaurus, a much larger predator. They manage to get to Claire.Alan, Ellie, and Maisie are making their way through caverns and find dinosaurs attacking, prompting them to run until they make it outside. Meanwhile, Ian tears Dodgson a new one for his actions, and Dodgson fires him. Ian works with Ramsay to get back to Ian's friends. He helps them escape the dinosaurs by freeing them from the enclosure. Dodgson then sets fire to the locust lab to destroy evidence. The flaming locusts break free and begin flying out into the open. Alan, Ellie, Ian, and Maisie attempt to outrun a large dinosaur in a van but are knocked down a hill. Luckily, they land near Owen, Claire, and Kayla, reuniting the former two with Maisie. Claire also gets to meet Ellie while Owen meets Alan. The group is then stalked by the Giganotosaurus, who almost gets Maisie, but she escapes. Ian fends it off by throwing a burning cloth into its mouth.While the heroes work on an escape plan, BioSyn starts to burn to the ground, forcing the employees to flee. Dodgson attempts to make off with his work, and Ramsay tells him off one last time before leaving. Dodgson attempts to get away in the monorail, but is cornered by a trio of Dilophosaurus, who make a meal out of him. Beta comes upon the heroes and is sedated so they can safely bring her along. They are also found by Wu, who has found a way to alter the locusts' DNA to stop the spread. Just as the group prepares their leave, the Giganotosaurus reappears, but is then caught between the T-Rex and a Therizinosaurus. The humans flee to avoid the dino fight, and it ends when the T-Rex pushes the Giganotosaurus into the Therizinosaurus's claws.Upon returning to safety, Alan and Ellie rekindle their romance and later head to Washington DC to testify against BioSyn. Wu's work is a success and stops the locust spread. Owen, Claire, and Maisie return home and reunite Beta with Blue. Before retreating back into the forest, Blue shares one last look with Owen.One final voiceover proclaims that dinosaurs and humans must adapt in order to co-exist."
Minions: The Rise of Gru,2022,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5113044/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The untold story of one twelve-year-old's dream to become the world's greatest supervillain. In the heart of the 1970s, amidst a flurry of feathered hair and flared jeans, Gru (Steve Carell) is growing up in the suburbs. A fanboy of a supervillain supergroup known as the Vicious 6, Gru hatches a plan to become evil enough to join them. Luckily, he gets some mayhem-making back-up from his loyal followers, the Minions. Together, Kevin, Stuart, Bob, and Otto - a new Minion sporting braces and a desperate need to please - deploy their skills as they and Gru build their first lair, experiment with their first weapons, and pull off their first missions. When the Vicious 6 oust their leader, legendary fighter Wild Knuckles (Alan Arkin), Gru interviews to become their newest member. It doesn't go well (to say the least), and only gets worse after Gru outsmarts them and suddenly finds himself the mortal enemy of the apex of evil. On the run, Gru will turn to an unlikely source for guidance, Wild Knuckles, and discover that even bad guys need a little help from their friends.—Universal Pictures San Francisco, 1976. Bent on becoming the most despicable supervillain on Earth, aspiring mega-criminal Gru is thrilled to discover that his idols, the Vicious Six team of baddies, have an open spot. However, evil is for adults. As 12-year-old Gru summons up the courage to prove his worth, determined to live out his wicked dreams, the brazen theft of the powerful Zodiac Stone and the chance encounter with Vicious Six founder Wild Knuckles set a comic, high-energy adventure in motion. But after the events ofMinions (2015), a question arises. Do the fearless, denim-clad followers still have Mini Boss's back?—Nick Riganas The classic movie characters childhood is finally revealed. In the 70's, Gru's big dream was to be a villain. Then he met the minions Light hearted, pill shaped servants. When the Vicious 6 fire there leader, a job opens, leading Gru to his dream. But then Gru is kidnapped, and it's all up to 2015's greatest comedy idiots, Bob,Kevin and Strewart to save Gru, there leader—Bob-dog-11 A young male who dreams of becoming a villain must work together with his minions to defeat a group of villains from gaining ultimate power and taking control of everyone and everything. Along the way, he learns the true reality of becoming a real villain.—RECB3 The year 1976 is where the story begins. Belle Bottom, played by Taraji P. Henson, is a
supervillain who is being pursued by the Anti-Villain League as she races across the city after
stealing a map. Following her victory over the AVL agents, Belle makes her way to her hiding
place at the Criminal Records record store. There, she meets the other members of her team,
the Vicious 6, including their founder, Wild Knuckles, as well as members Strong Hold (Danny
Trejo), Nun-Chuck (Lucy Lawless), Svengeance (Dolph Lundgren), and Jean-Clawed
(Jean-Claude Van Damme) (Alan Arkin). They examine the map, and upon doing so, they
discover that it details the location of an artifact known as the Zodiac Stone. Utilizing this artifact
during the Chinese New Year transforms its users into powerful animals.
The Vicious 6 traveled by plane to a remote island in search of the Stone. Wild Knuckles makes
his way inside the temple and discovers the Zodiac Stone, but as soon as he does so, he is
ambushed by a number of small metal guardians. He engages them in combat and then
escapes the temple, only to discover that additional temple guards are pursuing him. The
remaining five of the six pull Knuckles up, but then they steal the Stone from him and turn the
tables on him, telling him that he is too old to lead the team and that they need new blood to
take over instead. They cast Knuckles into the water and then take off into the sky.
Young Gru, played by Steve Carell, is 11 years old and has always had the ambition of
becoming a supervillain. As a result, the other children view him as a peculiar individual and
avoid his company. Kevin, Bob, and Stuart are the ones who come to get him (all Pierre Coffin,
along with the rest of the Minions). They make their way back to Gru's residence, where he
discovers something that was sent to him in the mail. It is a message from Belle Bottom, as Gru
had sent an application to join the Vicious 6 since he is their biggest fan, and Knuckles is his
favorite villain. The context of the message is that Knuckles is Gru's favorite villain (or, was). Gru
receives an invitation from Belle to attend an audition that will take place at the Criminal
Records shop. Gru is ecstatic and believes that his time to shine as a supervillain has finally
arrived. He is seen just living with his unsupportive mother Marlena, who is played by Julie
Andrews, as well as the rest of the Minions that he has employed as his henchmen. He is seen
just living with them. Gru relays the exciting news to the Minions, who enthusiastically rally
behind their ""mini boss"" despite Gru's displeasure with the moniker.
It has been discovered that Wild Knuckles is in fact still alive and is currently residing in his
mansion along with three of his own goons (John DiMaggio, Kevin Michael Richardson, and
Jimmy O. Yang). He hasn't gotten over the fact that the Vicious 6 kicked him off his own team,
and now he's heard that they're looking for a new member to join them. This has made him very
bitter.
The following day, Gru makes it to Criminal Records, where he is introduced to a younger
version of Dr. Nefario, played by Russell Brand and described as an ambitious mad scientist. He
demonstrates one of his most recent creations to Gru, which is a rifle that fires a sticky green
hand that can grab anything. Nefario hands it over to Gru and then walks him through the
hidden passageway that leads to the Vicious 6's lair. However, when he finally meets them, they
dismiss him for being a youngster because Jean-Clawed imagined that he was a tiny man when
they were reviewing his application. As they walk away, another candidate walks in and tries to
impress everyone with his pilot outfit, but his jetpack suddenly stops working, causing him to
soar erratically through the air. The Vicious 6 make an effort to stop him, which diverts their
attention just as Gru discovers the Zodiac Stone hiding behind them. He steals the Stone by
using the revolver that Nefario gave him, but the six of them find him and begin to pursue him.
Gru catches up with the other minions and hands the Stone over to one of them, named Otto.
Gru flees on his horse while the six warriors pursue him. He makes it so that Strong Hold and
Nun-Chuck are unable to defend themselves, and when Belle and Svengeance grab a hold of
Gru's bike, he uses the rocket to get them out from there as quickly as possible. Knuckles, who
was there the whole time, now follows Gru around in his vehicle after seeing all that happened.
Once Gru and the other Minions have returned to their home, they wait for Otto to return from
work. When he does, he gives Gru a rock that has googly eyes attached to it as a gift. Otto adds
that he ended up going through a series of unfortunate events until he found up at a birthday
party, at which point he traded the Stone for the pet rock that was being given away to the
birthday boy. Because of Otto's mistake, Gru is fuming with rage, and he immediately fires all of
the Minion workers. He sets off on his own to locate the Stone, but as he walks along the street,
the goons working for Knuckles capture him and put him into their van, as Kevin watches from
outside the window of the vehicle. He then proceeds to inform the other Minion workers that
their mini boss has been taken hostage.
Gru is taken to where Wild Knuckles has been hiding out. Knuckles is perturbed to discover that
Gru is not in possession of the Stone, which causes Gru to be overjoyed at the prospect of
meeting his hero. He calls Gru's house in an effort to coerce his mother into paying a ransom,
but Kevin answers the phone instead. Knuckles tells him to bring the Stone to San Francisco
within the next two days or they will kill Gru.
Otto, Kevin, and Stuart go to the kid's house that Otto gave the Stone to, and Bob joins them
there as well. The youngster explains that he handed it over to his uncle, who goes by the name
RZA and is already riding away on a motorcycle. Otto and the other three Minions chase after
him on a tricycle as they search for a bus for an advertisement to take them to San Francisco.
They go to the airport, where they put on disguises and pretend to be pilots and a flight
attendant in order to join the following flight. Kevin and Stuart make an attempt to fly, but they
wind up messing everything up by pressing all of the buttons and making a whole mess of
things before safely landing (sort of).
Knuckles torments Gru by placing him in a gadget resembling a record player, which brings him
closer and closer to saws that are rotating. He dispatches his underlings into the world, and
those underlings end up discovering the Minions. They attempt to seize them since they believe
the Stone is in their possession, and as a result, they find themselves in Chinatown, where an
acupuncturist named Master Chow (Michelle Yeoh) watches the goons beat on the Minions.
Chow, despite her age and the fact that she is a little old lady, demonstrates remarkable kung fu
skills and fights off the goons. Chow informs the Minions that she is no longer active in that line
of work when they beg her to teach them her abilities. Nevertheless, she gives in after the three
of them give her the puppy eye expression.
After the incident, the henchmen decided to give up on Knuckles. After rescuing Gru from the
trap, he puts Gru to work around the house. Knuckles drowns while he is in the process of
cleaning his crocodile-filled pool. Knuckles is grateful that Gru was able to rescue him and drag
him out of the pit in which he was trapped. He takes Gru along with him on the burglary. They
pretend to be a grandfather and grandson so that they can rob the Bank of Evil. Knuckles acts
as though he is having a heart attack so that Gru can steal the keys from Mr. Perkins' house
(Will Arnett). Gru is successful in his attempt to steal the Mona Lisa, much to Knuckles' delight.
Otto pursues the Biker on his tricycle through a number of states, but he is unable to keep up
with him and eventually loses sight of him. Otto is eventually found by the Biker, who then takes
him up, transports him to San Francisco on his motorcycle, and presents him with the Stone.
Chow teaches the Minion gang various forms of martial arts, but more often than not, the Minion
gang injures themselves rather than improving their skills. They are able to quickly improve their
talents, despite Chow's assertion that they have only passed the basic training. Unfortunately,
the Minions have already made their escape, and they are already traveling to help Gru.
The Vicious 6 locate Gru's house, rip off its roof, and then question Marlena and the other
Minions about the whereabouts of Gru. The fact that Gru was kidnapped by Knuckles is
revealed by one of the Minions. The group of six then travels to Knuckles' residence, where they
proceed to rip the roof off, search the property thoroughly, and come up empty-handed.
When Knuckles and Gru return, they find that Gru's home has been demolished. He is angry
because he is aware that the 6 were the ones who did this, and he is frustrated that they would
still try to injure him after all of this time has passed. In spite of Gru's protests, he breaks the
news to him that he is given up and just instructs him to go back home.
A parade celebrating the Chinese New Year is currently taking place downtown. Otto ultimately
causes a commotion by dashing into the crowd. Gru spies him as he is on the trolley and
immediately starts chasing after him. Otto reveals the Stone to Gru, who then professes his
admiration for Otto. Regrettably, the Vicious 6 have managed to catch up to them, and now
have Gru in their custody. In the nick of time, just as they are about to be surrounded by the
Anti-Villain League, Belle seizes the Stone and uses its abilities to transform both her and the
crew into enormous animal monsters. Strong Hold transforms into a bull, Nun-Chuck into a
snake, Svengeance into a tiger, and Jean-Clawed into a monstrous monkey. Belle transforms
into a dragon that breathes fire (with his lobster claw arm). They seize Gru and bind him to the
hands of a clock tower, which will gradually rip him to pieces over time.
Knuckles, Kevin, Stuart, and Bob all appear to come to Gru's rescue at the same time. The
three are reincarnated as a rabbit, a chicken, and a ram after being transformed by Belle.
Despite the fact that Knuckles puts up a valiant effort, Belle is able to defeat him with her fire
breath. The three individuals recall what Chow had said and let loose their inner animals; they
then proceed to defeat the mutated version of Vicious 6. Gru is set free by Otto, and he
immediately heads off to assist his buddies. The three Minions easily dispatch the six, and Gru
seizes the Stone, which he then employs to transform his opponents into rats. They were taken
into arrest by the AVL when they arrived. Knuckles suffers an injury and is subsequently
detained; nonetheless, he assures Gru that they will meet again in the near future.
The scene then cuts to a funeral, where it would appear that Knuckles has passed away. Gru
delivers a heartfelt eulogy for him, only to later discover that Knuckles staged his own death and
is in hiding. Following the performance of the Minion version of ""You Can't Always Get What You
Want,"" Gru is reunited with his idol, and the two of them continue their journey into the sunset
with the remaining Minions.
During the roll of credits, Gru leads the rehired Minions to the Criminal Records business, which
has the appearance of being closed. Gru asks Dr. Nefario whether he would be interested in
officially working for him and building gadgets, but Nefario responds by saying that he is retiring
from the criminal underworld. After Gru and the Minions have successfully persuaded him with
their puppy eyes, he reveals a surprise to Gru, which is the rocket car that Gru is seen driving as
an adult. The newly formed evil crew immediately sets its sights on committing even more
heinous acts"

Billionaire Bruce Wayne, who has operated for two years as the vigilante Batman, investigates alongside the Gotham City Police Department (GCPD). Lieutenant James Gordon discovers that the Riddler left a message for Batman, but commissioner Pete Savage berates him for allowing a vigilante to enter the crime scene and forces Batman to leave. The Riddler kills Savage and leaves another message for Batman.Batman and Gordon discover that the Riddler left a thumb drive in Mitchell's car containing images of Mitchell with a woman, Annika, at the Iceberg Lounge, a nightclub operated by mobster Carmine Falcone's lieutenant Penguin. Batman questions the Penguin, who pleads ignorance, but notices that Selina Kyle, Annika's roommate and girlfriend, works there as a waitress.

Upon realizing Batman hasn't figured out his next course of action, a delighted Nashton gives him one last clue by singing ""Ave Maria,"" the song sung at the Mitchell's funeral to imply that the final part of the plan is mayor-elect Bella Real's assassination. However, Batman fails to realize this and exclaims, ""What have you done!?""Searching his apartment, Batman is inadvertently aided by a cop who shows him a carpet cutting tool which Riddler had murdered the mayor with at the beginning. Realizing this tool is another clue to uncovering the Riddler's master plan, Batman cuts open the rug of the apartment and discovers via a map drawn on the floor underneath that Nashton has stationed car bombs around Gotham. No sooner has he done this than an online video of Nashton's final transmission before his capture and incarceration plays, explaining gleefully that he had cultivated an online following that plans to assassinate mayor-elect Bella Reál.The bombs destroy the breakwaters around Gotham and flood the city.

Just as he begins to hear a voice calling out to him in the distance, Gorr discovers an oasis where he finds Rapu, who had killed the latest wielder of an ancient weapon known as All-Black the Necrosword. Rapu makes fun of Gorr for his helplessness and refuses to provide any assistance. Feeling betrayed, Gorr claims the Necrosword and beheads him, and vows for the elimination of all gods.Thor continues his adventures with the Guardians of the Galaxy, responding to distress calls across the universe while working to get back in shape. However, Thor remains discontent with where he is in life, and intends to retire. An influx of incoming calls regarding Gorr emerge, one of them being from Lady Sif, who had hunted him down.

They find a defeated Sif with her arm severed, who warns them that Gorr will attack New Asgard next.Meanwhile, Dr. Jane Foster undergoes treatment for stage IV cancer. Efforts to research for a cure prove futile and she beings to lose hope, but Foster becomes inspired to travel to New Asgard in hopes that their magic can help eliminate the cancer. As Thor has unknowingly enchanted it to protect Foster while they were together, Mjølnir becomes drawn to her presence, fusing itself back together and imbuing her with the powers of the Mighty Thor.That night, Gorr uses the Necrosword to swarm New Asgard with shadow monsters. Thor, Korg, and Sif arrive to confront them, as does King Valkyrie and Foster, who Thor is surprised to see. While they were able to repel the monsters, Gorr escapes with Asgard's children, including Heimdall's son Axl Heimdallson. Thor communicates with Axl and deduces that the children are in the Shadow Realm. Knowing that Gorr's strength would be at its peak their, Thor, Mighty Thor, Valkyrie, and Korg travel to Omnipotence City to warn Zeus of Gorr and ask for an army to help fight him.Unconvinced that Gorr is a threat to Omnipotence City, Zeus instead has Thor captured, forcing the others to intervene and fend off Zeus' men. In the scuffle, Zeus uses his Thunderbolt to destroy Korg's body; only his face remains intact. Enraged, Thor uses the Thunderbolt to impale Zeus in the chest, which Valkyrie steals as the group escapes to confront Gorr in the Shadow Realm. On the way, Thor learns of Foster's cancer diagnosis, and the two rekindle their relationship.Upon arrival, they attempt to locate the children, only to realise that it was a trap.

Thor is informed that the effects of Mjølnir are aggravating Foster's cancer, and he urges her to stay behind to recover. Valkyrie is also unable to continue fighting, leaving the Thunderbolt in Thor's possession so that he can fight Gorr again.At the center of the universe, Gorr begins opening Eternity's gate with Stormbreaker. Thor arrives using Thunderbolt and imbues the children with the power of Thor, giving them enough strength to overcome the remaining shadow monsters. Gorr gains the upper hand against Thor. Having sensed his distress, Foster decides to wield Mjølnir again despite her weakened condition and joins the fight through using Valkyrie's winged horse. Thor gives Mighty Thor ample time to use Mjølnir to shatter the Necrosword into pieces, dooming herself and Gorr. Thor recovers Stormbreaker and has the children use it to return home, but they could not stop Gorr from entering Eternity.Thor calls out to Gorr and pleads for him to choose love over death as he rushes to Mighty Thor's side. Their love reminded him of the love he had for his daughter, thus deciding to use his wish to resurrect her. Foster soon succumbs to her illness and dies in Thor's arms, vanishing into Valhalla.

Being directed byJeff Fowler, and starringJim Carrey,James Marsden, andBen Schwartz. When the manic Dr Robotnik returns to Earth with a new ally, Knuckles the Echidna. Sonic and his new friend Tails is all that stands in their way. Sonic is back with a boom, this is by far the most entertaining of all video game adaptions in history. It was great to see Jim Carrey reprise his role of Dr Robotnik, he plays the role so well the first time and this time he does it even better. There were so many moments within this piece of cinema that hit me with memories from the video games, I think the director done a fantastic job and he definitely had some Sonic Adventure knowledge. A great family film for all the kids to love and those like me who grew up playing Sonic on the dreamcast/Nintendo, these past couple of years have activated alot of nostalgia among the art of film. Highly Recommend this incredible follow up to the Blue Justice himself. 10/10—BrnzReviews Getting used to his new life in Green Hills, Sonic The Hedgehog has become the town's speedy protector and all is right with the world: but the dreaded Doctor Robotnik returns to Earth and this time he's pursuing the ultimate power to destroy Sonic once and for all: The Chaos Emeralds. When a mysterious fox named Miles 'Tails' Prower tries finding Sonic, another creature known as Knuckles The Echidna gets caught in the fray over the Chaos Emeralds. The worlds of Green Hills and Mobius converge in Sonic The Hedgehog 2.—Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187 On the Mushroom Planet, Dr. Robotnik/""Eggman"" (Jim Carrey) has been stranded for a while. In his time trying to find a way back to Earth, he has attempted to make mushroom coffee and has failed miserably. He soon thinks he's found the right way to get himself home, as he manages to create a ring portal to another world. Stepping out are three warriors, who soon fall victim to Robotnik's series of traps. Moments later, Knuckles the echidna (Idris Elba) steps out of the portal and notices Robotnik holding Sonic's (Ben Schwartz) quill, asking him where he got that. Robotnik happily offers to show him.In Seattle, Sonic tries out being a superhero, calling himself ""Blue Justice"". He attempts to foil a truck robbery by kicking the robbers out, but he ends up careening through the streets with little control. He finds a bag of bombs and throws them out, only for them to blow up inside a garbage truck, and another bomb that he left ends up falling into the sewers and causing an explosion that sends water bursting out. Before the truck crashes into a crowd of people, Sonic quickly dismantles the truck and flees before anyone else is hurt.Sonic returns home to Green Hills where he still lives with the Wachowskis and Ozzie the dog. Maddie (Tika Sumpter) reminds Sonic that he agreed to go fishing with Tom (James Marsden). While out on the lake, Tom tells Sonic that he is being too reckless as a hero, and that a real hero has to take responsibility for his actions and look out for the people closest to him. Sonic takes his words to heart.Tom and Maddie prepare to leave for Hawaii because Maddie's sister Rachel (Natasha Rothwell) is getting married. Sonic opens a ring portal for them to go through, and he is excited to stay home with Ozzie. Sonic trashes the house while having fun, but he still uses his super-speed to clean everything up. Meanwhile, not far from home, Miles ""Tails"" Prower (Colleen O'Shaughnessey) emerges from his own portal, as he has been tracking Sonic and is going to warn him of impending danger.Later that night, Sonic is watching TV with Ozzie when he hears something at the door. He finds Robotnik having broken in, returning to Earth through the ring portal. Before Sonic can deliver a whooping to Robotnik, the mad scientist sends Knuckles after Sonic. The echidna uses his super strength to punch Sonic through the walls. Sonic recognizes Knuckles's species and believes that Knuckles wants his power, but Knuckles is simply out for revenge against Sonic because the rest of his echidna tribe had fallen in their search for Sonic, as well as the knowledge to the location of an item called the Master Emerald. Before Knuckles can kill Sonic, Tails drives a cop car to pick up Sonic and uses his gadgets to drive it. Tails explains to Sonic that ever since the energy surge he caused (in the first movie), he has been tracking Sonic from his home planet and watched as he defeated Robotnik the first time, but he observed Robotnik and Knuckles teaming up, so he came to warn him. Knuckles chases after them, but Sonic and Tails manage to lose him when Tails uses his...tails...like a helicopter to fly himself and Sonic away. Robotnik helps Knuckles back up and offers to form an alliance so that they can find the Master Emerald together and kill Sonic.Agent Stone (Lee Majdoub) is working as a barista in his own coffee shop, where he still misses his boss. Once Robotnik contacts him, he shuts down the coffee shop and excitedly celebrates the mad doctor's return. Stone then unveils his own creations hidden in the shop and uses it to summon a pod from space to bring a horde of Robotnik's drones down to Earth. Robotnik and Knuckles arrive at the shop and have Stone utilize his tech to help them track Sonic.Sonic and Tails go to the home of Wade (Adam Pally) as they try to figure out how to get to the Master Emerald before Robotnik and Knuckles. Sonic still has a map given to him by Longclaw (Donna Jay Fulks), and when he touches the symbol, it activates a hologram message from Longclaw herself. She explains that the Master Emerald is capable of converting thoughts to energy, and it is hidden somewhere on Earth. She ends the message reassuring Sonic of her love for him. Determining that the compass that will help them track the Emerald is in Siberia, Sonic opens a ring portal and convinces Tails to join him on this new quest.In Hawaii, Tom and Maddie meet Rachel's fiance, Randall (Shemar Moore). Rachel appears to want to bury the hatchet with Tom, but she quietly warns him she will destroy him if he does anything to ruin the wedding. Tom watches Randall's buddies and tells Maddie that he wishes Sonic had a friend group (or ""squad"") like that.In Siberia, Sonic and Tails arrive at a bar. Tails uses his tech to try and translate his words, but he accidentally ends up insulting the barmaid and other patrons. When their disguises are removed, the patrons see them as freaks and try to toss them into a fire until Tails finds a word that calls out for a dance challenge. The lead dancer shows off to a old Siberian folk song, but Sonic changes it up by playing ""Uptown Funk"" and having Tails join him in a true dance battle, allowing them to win over the patrons when they defeat the lead dancer. Sonic and Tails then rest up for the night, with Tails feeling proud that he has befriended his idol.The next morning, Sonic and Tails fly over to a cave where they have tracked the compass. They see a statue of an owl warrior. Tails says that the owl and echidna tribes were enemies for centuries. The echidnas forged the Chaos Emeralds and fused them to create the Master Emerald, which the owls took away from them for fear that anyone possessing the Master Emerald might use its power to take control over everything. The two use the symbols on the map to get the compass out. Unfortunately, Robotnik and Knuckles arrive and attack. Taking the compass, Sonic snowboards out of the cave while Tails tries to fly out as Robotnik sends his drones after them, and Knuckles chases Sonic down the mountain. Sonic destroys the drones but is knocked over a ledge by Knuckles, causing him to lose his rings. While Sonic hangs on, Knuckles tells his own backstory - he was a child when his father went off with the rest of the echidnas to fight Longclaw, a battle that left no survivors, including Longclaw and Knuckles's father. It left Knuckles with resentment and a desire to avenge his father and tribe. Sonic tells Knuckles that they both lost everything that day. Tails traps Knuckles, but when Sonic throws him the compass, Robotnik catches it and knocks Tails out. Sonic goes to help his friend, which Knuckles takes note of since Sonic chose his friend over getting the compass. Knuckles and Robotnik escape just as an avalanche occurs.Sonic rides down the mountain while carrying Tails and tries to contact Tom, just as Rachel and Randall are set to be married. Tom goes to answer the phone and sees that Sonic is in danger, so the hedgehog asks Tom to use the ring that he gave him to open a portal and get Sonic out. The problem is, Tom accidentally switched the portal ring with Rachel's wedding ring. He goes to get the ring before Randall puts it on Rachel's finger and uses it to open the portal to Siberia, allowing Sonic, Tails, and a gigantic pile of snow to fly out and cover everyone. Just as Sonic tries to explain the situation to Tom and Maddie, it is revealed that Randall and all the wedding guests are agents with a corporation called GUN (Guardian Units of Nations), led by Commander Walters (Tom Butler). They capture Sonic, Tails, and Tom, while Rachel is furious to learn that her whole wedding was a cover-up.Maddie and Rachel get some of Tails's tech and get past the agents so that Maddie can free Tom and the boys while Rachel goes to confront Randall. He admits that while the wedding was a sham, he truly did end up falling in love with her, and she forgives him as they kiss. Meanwhile, Maddie frees her husband and friends. Just as they go outside, they see a large green beam, as Robotnik and Knuckles have found the island where the compass brought them, and they are closer to finding the temple containing the Master Emerald. Sonic chooses to go after the villains by himself because Tails got hurt and he doesn't want Tom and Maddie to get hurt either. He runs across the water, but Tails wakes up and tells Tom and Maddie they all need to help Sonic.Sonic makes it to the temple and finds Robotnik and Knuckles. He and Knuckles have a second showdown, with Knuckles punching as hard and fast as he can, but Sonic taps into his own powers to dodge Knuckles's attacks and lay a beat-down on him. Sonic then tries to tell Knuckles that Robotnik is trying to get the Emerald for himself, and Knuckles finds this to be true when he turns around. Robotnik betrays Knuckles and leaves him to his fate as he absorbs the Emerald and begins to harness the Chaos Energy. The temple begins to be brought down by water, with Knuckles trapped under a pillar. Sonic helps free him, and Knuckles helps Sonic out of the water before he drowns. Although Knuckles is feeling betrayed, Sonic convinces him to join forces so that they can stop Robotnik. They are picked up by Tails, coming in on a plane.Robotnik teleports back to the coffee shop, where Wade has Stone in handcuffs after discovering his shady activity. GUN agents surround the place outside, and Robotnik uses his new powers to dismantle their tanks and other nearby vehicles as he begins to construct his own giant Eggman mecha, which is witnessed by Tom and Maddie. Tails flies himself, Sonic, and Knuckles closer to the mecha. The three join forces to come up with a plan to defeat Robotnik. Knowing that Robotnik's weakness is Sonic himself, the hedgehog goes to taunt Robotnik while Tails flies Knuckles high enough to attack the robot. Tails opens a hole inside, and Knuckles get in, managing to punch Robotnik hard enough to send the Emerald flying out of him. However, he uses auxiliary energy to keep the mecha running. Outside, Sonic tries to get the Emerald, while Tom and Maddie drive by and save him. Robotnik causes them to crash, and when Sonic grabs the Emerald, it breaks apart into the smaller Emeralds. He tells Tom and Maddie he loves them as they prepare to be crushed by Robotnik, and with this, Sonic absorbs the Emeralds and becomes Super Sonic, a golden, powered-up version that is ten times stronger and more powerful. He puts multiple dents in Robotnik's suit before knocking it over completely, sending Robotnik falling with it. Sonic then releases the Emeralds so that Knuckles can put it back together as the Master Emerald once again.Sometime later, Tom and Maddie take in Tails and Knuckles, who have now become like Sonic's brothers. They play baseball until Knuckles punches the ball too hard and sends it flying away. The three friends agree to keep the Master Emerald safe together, and Tom and Maddie take them out for ice cream.During the credits, GUN agents survey the wreckage of the Eggman mecha, and they assume Robotnik is dead, unaware that Stone is in disguise among them trying to find his boss. Another agent tells Walters that GUN has uncovered the coordinates to an experiment hidden for over 50 years. Walters realizes with horror that this is ""Project Shadow"".

Seeing that Puss has lost his arrogance, Death begrudgingly spares him. Before leaving, Death and Puss agree they will meet again one day.Horner eats a magic snack inside the bag, which makes him gigantic and allows him to escape.

Reawakening after 5000 years, Black Adam becomes the world's ruthless protector: an anti-villain to take on the likes of Superman and Wonder Woman. Now in the 21st-Century, Black Adam must face off against the Justice Society of America and its heroes: Doctor Fate, Hawkman, Atom Smasher and Cyclone. The fate of the world hangs in the balance.—Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187 Five thousand years ago, the city of Kahndaq was under the tyrannical rule of king Anh-Kot, who intended to create the Crown of Sabbac, which is known to give the wearer great power. After enslaving his people and forcing them to dig for ""Eternium"" - the magical crystal needed to create the crown - a young boy leads the slaves to revolt against him. When the boy is given the power of Shazam, transforming him into Kahndaq's heroic champion Teth-Adam, he kills Anh-Kot and ends his reign.In the present day, Khandaq is oppressed by the Intergang. Archaeologist Adrianna Tomaz tries to locate the Crown of Sabbac, with the help of her brother Karim, and colleagues, Samir and Ishmael. As Adrianna obtains the crown, they are ambushed by the Intergang, killing Samir in the process. Adrianna accidentally reads an incantation which awakens Adam from his slumber, who subsequently slaughters most of the Intergang troops. After an Intergang soldier shoots an Eternium rocket at Adam which renders him comatose, it is revealed that Ishmael is an Intergang member who intends to take the crown for himself.Government official Amanda Waller learns of the incident and contacts Carter Hall / Hawkman to assist in taking Adam into custody. Hawkman is accompanied by his fellow members of the Justice Society of America (consisting of Kent Nelson / Doctor Fate, Maxine Hunkel / Cyclone, and Albert ""Al"" Rothstein / Atom Smasher) to stop Adam.Adrianna sees an inscription on an inner part of the Crown which states ""Life is the only way to Death"". Adrianna's son Amon sees Adam as Khandaq's hero, but Adam denies it and departs. Wanting to prove to Kahndaq that their champion has reawakened, Amon makes a ruckus with the Intergang, successfully leading Adam to intervene and overpower them. The JSA arrive in time to stop Adam from doing further destruction. As they fight, Fate senses that Adrianna has the Crown of Sabbac. They manage to stop Adam for a while before he flees to the ruins of Anh-Kot's palace. The JSA ask Adrianna to give them the crown, but she declines until they tell her the truth that Adam was the one who lost control of his power five thousand years ago and destroyed most of Khandaq.The crown is given to Amon, who takes it back home. Ishmael is there with Karim, and reveals his true colors. Amon runs away from Ishmael, who shoots and wounds Karim, and chases Amon. Meanwhile, Adrianna and the JSA meet Adam, and attempt to convince him that he can be a hero to Khandaq, before Amon calls Adrianna, who pleads to Adam to save him. Adam immediately comes to the rescue, but Ishmael manages to abduct Amon and flees on an Eternium bike. Adam tries to rescue Amon by dealing with the Intergang on bikes to no avail. As Adam goes back to Adrianna's home, Hawkman manages to capture two Intergang members and interrogate them about their hideout. Adam uses brute force to interrogate both of them and learns where the Intergang's hideout is, but his way of interrogation enrages Hawkman. As Adam and Hawkman fight, they find that Amon hid the Crown of Sabbac in plain sight. They intend to use the Crown to trade with Amon and must fight side by side to save him. On their way, Fate reveals to Hawkman of his premonition about Hawkman's death.They reach Ishmael, who reveals that he is the last descendant of King Anh-Kot and, wanting his rightful place in the throne, demands the crown, which Adrianna willingly gives to save Amon's life. Unfortunately, Ishmael betrays his part of the deal by shooting Amon and putting the crown on himself. As Adam tries to save Amon, he loses control again and destroys the hideout with his power, until the JSA protects Amon and Adrianna as Ishmael dies in the process.Guilt-ridden, Adam flees to the ruins again. There, he reveals to Hawkman that it was actually Hurut, his son, who was Khandaq's champion; knowing that Hurut was invincible, the king's men executed Hurut's family instead, killing Isis and mortally wounding Adam in the process. Hurut gave his power to Adam to save him, but Anh-Kot's archer managed to kill the now-powerless Hurut. Enraged, Adam slaughtered all of the king's men, before he was summoned by the wizards of Shazam, who imprisoned him after deeming him unworthy. Feeling incapable of becoming Khandaq's champion and protecting it, Adam then surrenders to the JSA, who take him to Waller's underwater prison. Soon after, Fate continues to see the ominous premonition. It is later revealed that Ishmael intentionally made Adam kill him so that he can be reborn as Sabbac, which he succeeds in doing so, and arises from the underworld to Khandaq to claim his throne.The JSA arrive in time trying to stop Sabbac, who summons the undead to Khandaq. Adrianna and Amon fight them, with Karim joining them. Amon asks for the people of Khandaq to fight together against the undead for Kahndaq's freedom.The JSA prepare to face Sabbac in Anh-Kot's ruins. However, Fate creates a magical force field which forbids Hawkman, Cyclone and Atom Smasher from coming into the ruins, and reveals that Hawkman's death can be avoided, with Fate's sacrifice. Fate then fights Sabbac alone, and at the same time uses astral projection to release Adam from his suspended animation so Adam can help them. Adam manages to escape the prison, but Sabbac kills Fate. Fate's death causes the force field to disappear, allowing Hawkman, Cyclone and Atom Smasher try to fight Sabbac, who overpowers them. Just as he is about to kill the JSA, Adam arrives, and engages Sabbac, but is slowly losing as Sabbac's power can harm him. Hawkman uses Fate's helmet to create magical duplicates and spells, having learned from Fate, to help Adam kill Sabbac, ultimately stopping the undead.The JSA depart on good terms with Adam, who accepts his new role as protector of Khandaq rather than its ruler. In a mid-credits scene, Waller communicates with a defiant Adam, warning him about forces ready to stop him, before he is confronted by Superman."

Of course, the former manager calls to mindElvis Presley's return to live performances with the 1968 televised Christmas concert,Elvis: The Comeback Special (1968), the 5-year residency in the International Hotel, Las Vegas, and the last Nebraska concert on June 20, 1977, at the Pershing Municipal Auditorium, Lincoln.Elvis Presleyrocked the stage in an unrivalled last performance on June 26, 1977, at the Market Square Arena in Indianapolis, only six weeks before his death.—Nick Riganas Las Vegas, January 1997.Colonel Tom Parker (Tom Hanks) collapses in his home from an apparent stroke. He is rushed to the hospital. As he lays dying in a hospital bed, news outlets remember him as a liar, a cheat, and a con man. Parker himself begins to narrate. He acknowledges that while many will paint him as the villain, he considers himself the man who gave the world the King of Rock and Roll, Elvis Aaron Presley (Austin Butler).In a flashback to Las Vegas in the 1970's, at the International Hotel. Elvis is barely able to stand, with his entourage dunking his head into ice cold water to get him on his feet. Parker shows up and declares that the most important thing is that Elvis be able to get up on that stage. Despite the chaos, Elvis manages to get up and perform ""An American Trilogy"" to an amazed crowd. While Parker continues his tale, he is seen walking alone through an empty casino. The same news outlets reporting Parker's demise also blame him for what happened to Elvis, but he firmly argues against those claims.Parker begins narrating his tale in the mid-1950's, where he, an undocumented Dutch immigrant, worked at a carnival for country-western singer Hank Snow (David Wenham). Hank's son Jimmie Rodgers (Kodi-Smit McPhee) shows up with a record that has a country kind of sound to it. While the others in the crowd seem to like the tune, Hank and Parker don't think the music is marketable since it sounds like music played by African-American folks. Jimmie informs them that the song is being sung by a white man, and Parker suddenly becomes interested.By Parker's account, he first encountered Elvis at a musical performance at one of Hank's shows for a radio performance, where the young man was nervous about getting onstage. He was encouraged by his mother Gladys (Helen Thomson) to get up there, saying that someone named Jesse is watching them. Parker explains in narration that Jesse was Elvis's twin brother who died in childbirth. Through his account, it is shown that Elvis's father Vernon (Richard Roxburgh) was incarcerated due to his shady dealings, and Elvis would get lost in comics and pretend he would do what he could to free his father. His favorite hero was Shazam (back when he was still known as Captain Marvel). As a kid, Elvis (here played by Chaydon Jay). He befriended black children and found himself enchanted by soulful black music. As an adult in the early 1950's, Elvis worked at Sun Records to make music and support his family.At the performance, everyone gets ready to watch Elvis go up and show what he's got. While he is initially mocked by the crowd, he immediately charms the ladies in the crowd with his voice and his gyrating hips. While the female crowd is amazed by Elvis, the older crowd is put off and considers him indecent.Elvis soon joins Hank's musical tour across the south, with Parker following him in an attempt to win him over. Elvis continues to draw hordes of female admirers, but Hank views him as being inappropriate for the crowd he wants to attract. At a carnival, Parker finds Elvis in a house of mirrors and talks to him on the ferris wheel. He tells Elvis that Hank wants to get rid of him, but Parker assures Elvis he can take him to new heights. Elvis, driven by his desire to help his family, agrees to work with Parker. The two even convince Gladys and Vernon to join, with Vernon being appointed to the management position of the newly founded Presley Enterprises.While Gladys is uncertain about Elvis venturing into a new career with music, he convinces her that he can make something of himself. Before making it big in music, Elvis works as a truck driver, but he is still amazed by black performers on Beale Street in Memphis like BB King (Kelvin Harrison Jr.) and Big Mama Thornton (Shonka Dukureh), the latter who sings the song ""Hound Dog"", which Elvis likes the sound of. His employers at Sun Records also encourage Elvis to strike out on his own.Elvis's star begins to rise as his popularity takes off, and with Parker's help, he is able to move his parents to a mansion, Graceland which is located near Memphis. Parker also develops Elvis merchandise, including pins that say ""I hate Elvis"" because even hate can make them some money. However, despite his success, the sexual nature of Elvis's dance moves and the way that he captivates the female audience puts a concern on parents and elected officials, who dub him ""Elvis The Pelvis"". Senator James Eastland (Nicholas Bell) personally rallies against Elvis and Parker, demanding that he clean up his act or go to jail.Elvis is made to wear more appropriate clothing (compared to what a butler wears), and his music is toned down, which disappoints his fans and angers Elvis for having to be held back. This also causes a strain between Elvis and Gladys, the latter who has fallen into alcoholism. He drives down to Beale Street and hangs out with BB King and other black folks, where they watch Little Richard (Alton Mason) perform. Elvis and BB talk outside, where BB says that there are too many people profiting off of Elvis to try and put him in jail for how he performs, so he encourages him to do whatever he wants to do.Elvis is driven to a concert, where he is ordered to not do so much as wiggle a finger, or he will be arrested. As Elvis gets onstage, he remembers BB's words and addresses the audience, saying nobody is going to change him, and the crowd goes wild. He begins to perform ""Trouble"" and the ladies in the audience go crazy as he wiggles his hips. Parker is horrified, and he orders security to pull Elvis offstage, where he is arrested.In 1958, Elvis is soon threatened with going to jail for indecency, but he is given the option to serve overseas in West Germany. Gladys fears for her son's safety, and she eventually dies. At her funeral, reporters try to get statements from Elvis, but both he and Vernon are too heartbroken to face anybody, and Elvis is left sitting in his mother's closet, sobbing against her clothes. Parker steps in and convinces him to step outside for the sake of Gladys, saying that everything she sacrificed for her son will be for nothing.By 1959, Elvis is serving in West Germany, where he meets Priscilla Wagner (Olivia DeJonge), the teenage daughter of an army pilot. Other people in the area like to catch a glimpse of Elvis, though he enjoys spending his private time with Priscilla, as he begins to fall in love with her.In the 1960's, Elvis makes his comeback to the United States by appearing as an actor in films in Hollywood, California beginning with ""Love Me Tender"". Parker notes that people only want to watch Elvis sing, so he is featured as a singer in more films. Elvis and Priscilla get married in 1967, and they have a daughter, Lisa Marie. Elvis later develops his own entourage, the ""Memphis Mafia"", which includes Priscilla, his friend Jerry Schilling (Luke Bracey), and several others. During his time on the road, Elvis learns about the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in April 1968 While Parker tells him it has nothing to do with them, Elvis believes it has everything to do with them. Elvis is introduced to Steve Binder (Dacre Montgomery) by Jerry, with Steve wanting to help Elvis out with his work.Parker books Elvis for a Christmas special on NBC where the producers want him to do a clean show and sing ""Here Comes Santa Clause"". Instead, Elvis performs many of his biggest hits, like ""Heartbreak Hotel"" and ""Jailhouse Rock"". At some point during a break, Elvis and company learn about the assassination of Robert Kennedy, which also deeply unnerves Elvis. Parker breaks it up and orders Elvis to do a Christmas song, since the producers won't pay him otherwise, and Parker will drop Elvis. The next night of the show, Elvis performs ""If I Can Dream"" as a protest song, and it becomes another big hit.A little later in 1970, Parker then brings Elvis to Las Vegas at the International Hotel, where the owners want to have Elvis there as a permanent headline performer. After scoring a huge payment for Elvis, Parker is then told that as long as Elvis performs at the International, Parker will have his debts wiped clean and have an endless line of credit (for gambling in the casinos). However, Elvis wants to start traveling and performing internationally, which Parker refuses to allow since he is undocumented, which was brought up earlier when he was confronted by Senator Eastland who made a background check on Parker. During his tenure at the hotel, Priscilla watches as Elvis kisses other women. Parker also orders tighter security due to Elvis getting death threats, as well as crazed fans trying to rush him onstage.In 1973, Elvis attempts to cut ties with Parker by firing him as his manager, only to be sued by him later on. Vernon tells Elvis that he owes over $8 million to Parker and the record label for his numerous and lavish expenses. Elvis angrily confronts Parker, but has no choice but to keep him on. The stress drives Elvis to a pill addiction and alcoholism, and he grows increasingly paranoid. During one of his shows, he publicly calls Parker out as someone who is keeping him caged up there, and he walks offstage after the curtain drops. In 1974, Priscilla ends up divorcing Elvis due to his addiction, as well as him not being there for Lisa Marie.By the mid 1970's, Elvis is age 40, and he has started gaining weight. His health is also in serious decline. He and Parker rarely see each other from this point onward as Elvis's tours take up most of his time. Elvis is on a airport runway with Priscilla and Lisa Marie before he has to leave them again to go out on tour. Priscilla asks him to go to a special clinic that she heard about for his prescription drug addictions, at least for the sake of Lisa Marie, but Elvis says he cannot due to his touring and lavish spending of money. Priscilla tearfully leaves him for the last time before he boards his plane.In August 1977, Elvis dies at the age of 42 from a heart attack at his Graceland home. Fans all around the world pay tribute to him, and a statement is given by President Jimmy Carter to memorialize him. Parker's final narration states that he doesn't think it was the pills or alcohol, or even himself that killed Elvis, but rather, it was the love that Elvis desired from his fans. He also notes that he still got to see Elvis perform one last time before his death. Elvis is shown appearing obese and worn out, but he still manages to belt out ""Unchained Melody"" to an adoring crowd.Back in 1997, the aged Parker takes his final breath and quietly passes away.The ending text states that Colonel Tom Parker's greed and abuse of Elvis was made known in a series of lawsuits in the 1980s after Elvis' death. Although he tried to defend himself, Parker wound up spending his final years in disgrace, gambling away and pouring what little remained of his fortune into Vegas slot machines. Meanwhile, Elvis Presley is still the highest-selling solo artist of all time, and his influence and legacy on music continues to this day."

Nope,2022,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10954984/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The residents of a lonely gulch in inland California bear witness to an uncanny and chilling discovery. After random objects falling from the sky result in the death of their father, ranch-owning siblings OJ and Emerald Haywood attempt to capture video evidence of an unidentified flying object with the help of tech salesman Angel Torres and documentarian Antlers Holst.—Universal Pictures Santa Clarita, California. Siblings and animal wranglers Otis and Emerald Haywood, the young proprietors of the Haywood Hollywood Horses horse-handling business, find themselves struggling to keep their family ranch afloat after the death of their father in a freak accident. And unable to make ends meet, Otis strikes a deal with troubled former child actor Ricky Park, the owner of Jupiter's Claim theme park, unaware that a storm is brewing. When Otis thinks he has a close encounter of the second kind, sheer terror turns into morbid curiosity, and without a second thought, he enlists the help of tech-savvy electronics salesperson Angel Torres and prominent cinematographer Antlers Holst to make history. However, the next time the otherworldly visitor returns, the ambitious investigators will witness first-hand its true nature.—Nick Riganas The film opens with a Bible quote from Nahum 3:6: ""I will cast abominable filth upon you, make you vile and make you a spectacle.""The first thing shown is a bloody chimp wandering around a messy sitcom set. This will make sense later.Otis Haywood Sr. and his son, Otis Jr. (referred to as OJ), begin their day by taking care of the horses at their Hollywood ranch, Haywood's Hollywood Horses. In the background, a radio mentions the mysterious disappearance of two hikers. Soon, the electricity goes out and, after screams are heard from the sky, debris falls from the sky. A coin falls through Otis Sr.'s eye, killing him. OJ tries to get him to the hospital to no avail. Later, after arriving back at the ranch, OJ notices a key impaled into one of the horses.The opening credits are shown along with a green square, later zooming in to the first motion picture of a black man riding a horse.6 months after the event, OJ waits for his sister Emerald (referred to as Em) on a movie set where one of their horses, Lucky, is to be used for a commercial filmed by cinematographer Antlers Holst. Emerald soon arrives and helps explains the safety precautions of filming with Lucky, also mentioning that the black man on the horse in the first motion picture is her and OJ's great-great-great grandfather. However, the staff ignores them and disrespects the horse's boundaries, causing it to react violently. The Haywoods are fired from the project, with a VFX horse replacing Lucky instead.With the ranch struggling financially, the Haywoods go to meet Ricky ""Jupe"" Park, a former child actor who owns a Western-themed amusement park titled Jupiter's Claim, to sell Lucky to him - the 11th horse to be sold. During the meeting, Jupe recounts an SNL sketch based on a traumatizing event during his child acting career, when a chimp actor went berserk on the set of the sitcom Gordy's Home. Jupe offers to buy the Haywood ranch, and Em later encourages OJ to accept the deal.That night, Em recounts to OJ about how Otis Sr. promised Em that she would train her first horse named Jean Jacket, although the horse would later end up being used for a film, which ended up using another animal anyway. Em notices that Ghost, another horse of theirs, mysteriously ended up in the arena.Starting from this point, the film is divided into chapters, each title referring to the animals in the film. This chapter is titled GHOST.OJ goes to the arena and finds Ghost there. Suddenly, he notices something from far away - several lights and a voice playing on the speakers. The lights and the voice slowly turn off, and Ghost flees the arena. OJ finds Ghost fleeing from the ranch and disappearing while the other horses act violently in the ranch. As the electricity of the Haywood home turns off for a few seconds, OJ sees a flying saucer in the sky.OJ describes it as big and fast to Em. The two buy several cameras the next day at Fry's Electronics, seeking to be famous from the footage, where staff member Angel Torres explains to them that he'll help set up the cameras, theorizing that the Haywoods might be in a UFO hotspot. Later on, he visits the ranch to do so, describing his perspective on aliens in the process. Em leaves momentarily and returns with a stolen display horse from Jupiter's Claim, intending to use it as bait. Jupe later arrives at the ranch to question Em about the display horse, but she bluffs her way out of it. Jupe attempts to invite the Haywoods to an event, but his flyer is taken away by the wind. He then leaves.This chapter is titled CLOVER.That night, the cameras and the decoy horse are set up. OJ notices that someone let another horse, Clover, out. He then encounters what seems to be multiple aliens. When one of them sneaks behind OJ, he punches it in the face - only to find out it's a child. The aliens are revealed to be Jupe's children, taunting him for stealing their decoy horse.Later, OJ goes to find Clover, but the UFO arrives and sucks up the decoy horse, which gets stuck, causing Clover to run away. Angel, secretly watching their cameras at Fry's, tells Em that the UFO is in the clouds, and Em shouts at OJ to run. OJ manages to hide safely, but witnesses Clover getting sucked up too. They fail to get the footage they need, as a praying mantis had blocked the view of a camera that stayed online, not affected by the UFO. Em tells OJ that they need to leave, but he tells her that there's more to this than they think and persuades her to stay and go on with the plan.The next day, Angel arrives at the ranch again, explaining that he rewinded through their footage and found a cloud that never moves, which might be the UFO's hiding place. Em contacts Antlers and tries to get him to join them, but he declines, claiming that they'd never wake up from this dream of being famous. OJ wonders if the UFO isn't a ship.This chapter is titled GORDY.The year is 1998. Young Jupe and his fellow actors act in an episode for the sitcom Gordy's Home titled Gordy's Birthday. During a scene where balloons are released in the room, the balloons start popping, shocking the chimp playing Gordy, who starts to go wild and attacks the human stars. Jupe hides under a table, sees a shoe standing up on its own (which he would later put on display in the future), and watches as fellow co-stars Mary Jo Elliot and Tom Bogan get attacked by the chimp, who calms down after finishing the attacks. The chimp notices Jupe and approaches him, using sign language to ask what happened to the family. The chimp reaches out his fist for the duo's iconic fist bump, but before their fists can touch, the chimp is shot dead.Back in the present, Jupe thinks about the massacre. His wife, Amber, motivates him to prepare for an upcoming event, and helps him recite his lines.This chapter is titled LUCKY.While Angel sets up tarps for a coming storm, OJ finds Jupe's flyer promoting the Star Lasso Experience. Deducing that this might involve Lucky, he heads to Jupiter's Claim to get Lucky back.Meanwhile, the Star Lasso Experience is starting. Jupe tells the audience about a night where he witnessed the UFO, and promises that they will leave different after witnessing a spectacle. The UFO arrives early. Jupe reveals a glass box that contains Lucky, meant to be sucked up for the show. Lucky refuses to walk out of the box, and the UFO appears above the audience, which include Mary Jo Elliot, whose face has been disfigured from the Gordy incident. The camera focuses on Jupe's shocked expression as the shadows behind him depict the audience being sucked up by the UFO.The inside of the UFO is shown, and it is revealed to be an alien itself, with the green square from the opening credits being its eye. Thus, Jupe, his family, and the audience are digested by the alien, while screams and the crunching of bones are heard in the background.OJ arrives at the empty Jupiter's Claim and finds Lucky, before the alien returns to try to suck him up and he gets knocked out by the bleachers of the arena. He wakes up at night and finds Lucky intact, before loading the horse into his truck and driving towards the ranch. He calls Em and warns her that the UFO is actually a predatory alien who sees the ranch and the area surrounding it as its territory, while Angel, about to leave the ranch, is forced to seek refuge in the house. The alien arrives above the Haywood house and vomits blood and debris, to Em and Angel's horror. OJ arrives at the house but his truck is shut down before he can reach it, and the alien goes above the truck and spits out the decoy horse.The next morning, OJ gets Em and Angel to flee in Angel's truck, and the alien arrives again. Recalling the earlier incident with Lucky on the commercial set, OJ doesn't look at the alien and manages to survive the encounter. The group gets away successfully and goes to Angel's apartment. That night, while eating dinner, OJ explains that the alien feels challenged when people look at it and then eats them. Meanwhile, Antlers listens to a news report about the disappearance of the Star Lasso Experience's audience and decides to join OJ, Em, and Angel.The next day, he visits their house and the group begins to plan. Antlers will bring a hand-cranked camera that won't be deactivated by the alien, now called Jean Jacket, the group will use tube man props to deduce where the alien is, Em will watch the area using cameras, and OJ will bait Jean Jacket.This chapter is titled JEAN JACKET.The next day comes and the plan is set into motion. However, Ryder Muybridge, a TMZ reporter, trespasses on the area and falls off his motorbike when Jean Jacket deactivates it. OJ attempts to save Ryder but is forced to leave him to die when Jean Jacket arrives. OJ successfully baits the alien, helping Antlers to capture footage. However, Antlers decides that the world doesn't deserve the footage, and lets himself get killed by Jean Jacket, destroying the footage in the process.After Em and Angel survive their encounters with Jean Jacket, it starts to unfold into a huge jellyfish-like form. After Em and OJ salute each other, the former uses Ryder's motorbike to drive towards Jupiter's Claim while the latter baits Jean Jacket away. Once reaching Jupiter's Claim, Em untethers the park's giant balloon mascot and uses the Winkin' Well, an attraction that uses an analog camera, to capture a photo of Jean Jacket as it eats the balloon mascot. The balloon and Jean Jacket explode, and after screaming in triumph, Em rests near the Winkin' Well.As reporters arrive, Em stands up, closes her eyes, and opens them again to see OJ riding Lucky, appearing from the fog. The film ends with a shot of the photograph of Jean Jacket."
Lightyear,2022,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10298810/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"While spending years attempting to return home, marooned Space Ranger Buzz Lightyear encounters an army of ruthless robots commanded by Zurg who are attempting to steal his fuel source. Legendary space ranger Buzz Lightyear embarks on an intergalactic adventure alongside ambitious recruits Izzy, Mo, Darby, and his robot companion, Sox. As this motley crew tackles their toughest mission yet, they must learn to work together as a team to escape the evil Zurg and his dutiful robot army that are never far behind.—krmanirethnam In 1995, a boy got a Buzz LightYear toy based on his favorite movie. This is that movie.
A human spacecraft searches for habitable planets 4.3 M light years from Earth. When it detects a possible planet, the craft wakes up its commander from cryogenic sleep.
Buzz Lightyear (Chris Evans), a Space Ranger in Star Command, alongside his commanding officer and best friend, Alisha Hawthorne (Uzo Aduba), explore the habitable planet, T'Kani Prime, with their new recruit, Featheringhamstan (Bill Hader). They are forced to retreat to their exploration vessel after discovering that the planet hosts hostile lifeforms. Buzz damages the vessel during the retreat (he takes off at the wrong angle (as the ship was tied down by vines coming out of the ground), thereby hitting the top of a nearby mountain during its ascent), forcing the crew to evacuate in order to conduct repairs and continue their journey. The hyperspace crystal of the ship is destroyed.One year later, the crew have constructed a nascent colony along with the necessary infrastructure to conduct repairs. They even manufacture a new hyperspace crystal, but it needs to be tested before it can be deployed. Buzz volunteers to test hyperspace fuel, a key component of the repairs. I.V.A.N. (Mary McDonald-Lewis), a voice-activated virtual assistant is Buzz's autopilot. However, after a four-minute test, he finds that four years have passed on T'Kani Prime, due to the effects of time dilation from having traveled at relativistic speeds. The test was a failure as the fuel was unstable and the ship failed to achieve hyperspace speeds. Buzz vows to continue testing the fuel mix until they perfect it to continue the mission.
Buzz is introduced to Sox (Peter Sohn), a robotic feline who has been assigned to give him company after his long duration away from the colony, and continues testing the hyperspace fuel. To keep Sox busy, Buzz asks him to work on the fuel stability problem. With every test, four more years pass on T'Kani Prime, until eventually over 62 years have passed. During this time, the colony develops; Alisha raises a son with her wife Kiko, their son grows up, gets a promotion and gets married. Alisha subsequently dies of old age; and Sox improves the fuel's composition, allowing it to obtain faster-than-light speeds.Against the orders of his new commanding officer, Cal Burnside (Isiah Whitlock Jr.) (Cal informs Buzz that the colony has decided to build a laser shield to keep the critters out and that the current planet will be humanity's new home.. so, there is no need for hyperspace fuel anymore), Buzz uses this new fuel composition for a successful hyperspace test. But during the escape from the colony, Buzz breaks the computer with the formula, so the fuel sample in his hand is the only one left.
Upon landing, Buzz discovers 22 years have passed, during which T'Kani Prime has been invaded by Zyclops robots led by the mysterious Zurg (James Brolin). Buzz meets up with members of the colony's defense forces, including Izzy Hawthorne (Keke Palmer), Alisha's now-adult granddaughter; Mo Morrison (Taika Waititi), a fresh, naive recruit; and Darby Steel (Dale Soules), an elderly paroled convict. While initially reluctant to work with them, Buzz eventually warms to them. Together, they plan to attack Zurg's ship and destroy the invading force.Izzy takes Buzz to an abandoned storage area where some of the old ships are kept. Buzz manages to steal a ship, but has to take the others with him when they are attacked by giant critters. On their way to space. the ship is attacked by Zurg, who manages to hit Buzz's ship and forces him to land on the dark side of the planet.
The attack damages the ship's capacitor coil, forcing the group to get one from an abandoned mine a few miles away. The Zurg tracks them down at the mine and attacks the group, but strangely only goes after Buzz. Buzz manages to escape, but the robots launched by Zurg manage to steal the hyperspace fuel sample from Buzz's ship.Following an encounter, Zurg abducts Buzz, bringing him aboard his ship where he reveals that he is an older version of him from an alternate time-line in which, after the successful hyperspace test, Burnside attempted to arrest him for stealing the craft and forced him to escape. Aided by the effects of time dilation, he traveled to the far future, encountering a technologically advanced and abandoned vessel. He assumed Zurg's identity by wearing his signature Mecha suit, and traveled to the now-present to obtain more hyperspace fuel from Buzz in order to travel further back in time and prevent the exploration vessel from landing on T'Kani Prime in the first place. However, Buzz refuses due to the implications of the possible temporal paradox that would result from such actions, which would wipe out the current time-line and everyone from it. Meanwhile, Izzy, Mo, Darby, and Sox board Zurg's ship to assist Buzz. After a chaotic assault on the ship, Buzz and his comrades-in-arms destroy the ship and escape.However, Zurg, having survived his ship's destruction, arrives and attacks Buzz, grabbing the hyperspace fuel. Buzz shoots the fuel, causing it to explode and incapacitate Zurg. With the fuel gone, Buzz wishes to stay on T'Kani Prime. Upon landing, Burnside arrests Buzz, but relents, allowing Buzz to revive the Space Ranger Corps. Buzz selects Izzy, Mo, Darby, and Sox to form the core of this organization, much to Burnside's surprise. Buzz and his team are then sent off to a new adventure in parts unknown. In a post-credits scene, a seemingly lifeless Zurg is floating in space when his eyes suddenly light up."

She finds herself pressured over the death of her explorer husband from years prior, along with her publicist (Da'Vine Joy Randolph), who's demanding to see the latest draft of her book.Later on, Loretta, dressed in a purple sequined jumpsuit, is invited to an expo to speak about the book, egged on by her publicist and her social media manager (Patti Harrison). She's hesitant to go when she learns that the cover model for Dash, Alan Caprison (Channing Tatum) will also be there. She goes anyway, and Alan comes on stage to huge applause from the fans, wearing a fake blonde wig. Somewhere over the midst of the presentation, a fan asks for ""Dash"" to dip Loretta. She attempts to go through the motions, but rips off Alan's blonde wig, ending the presentation abruptly.After being chewed out by her publicist, Loretta finds her way outside instead of going to the next interview she's supposed to be at. She separates from Alan after a fight. She calls for a car, and is suddenly picked up in a black SUV and surrounded by mysterious henchmen. Alan sees her driving away and tries to pursue them, to no avail.Loretta comes face to face with Abigail Fairfax (Daniel Radcliffe), an eccentric billionaire who tries to woo her with a bunch of cheeses. He explains that an artifact hints at a mysterious treasure off of a small island, which could be wiped away by a volcano ready to erupt at any second. He asks Loretta to name her price, but she refuses. He then reveals that they have a plane waiting for her, and he knocks her out.Back at the hotel, Alan feels guilt for what happened to Loretta. He, her publicist, and her social media manager try to track her down. He eventually calls an old buddy he did yoga with, Jack Trainer (Brad Pitt) to help locate her via her Smart Watch. He tells Alan to meet him on the island and he'll have her back ""within 48 hours.""Loretta awakens, and is led to a campground where Abigail has set up shop to research the location of the treasure on the island. He has Loretta tied down and demands she get to work. Meanwhile, Alan makes his way to the island in pure touristy-fashion and meets up with Jack, and the two go off in a little car to Abigail's compound.After a short nap, Abigail pressures Loretta even more to translate the small piece he's found hinting at the treasure. She translates it, but he wants her to do it again. Meanwhile, Trainer dispatches of a number of his troops while Alan, locked out of the car he was supposed to stay in, serves as a useless backup, occasionally slapping a henchman or two.The pair eventually make their way to Loretta, but can't untie her out of the chair. They end up carrying her, chair and all, out of the compound as explosions go off. They make their way back to the car, but before they can leave, Jack is shot in the head, with his ""brains"" all over Alan's face. They eventually load into the car, with Loretta still in the chair, and take off. Abigail, furious that Loretta took the only puzzle piece with her, demands her recapture.Loretta and Alan pull over after a quick escape, after Loretta had fallen out of the car. Alan frees her from the chair, but after they return to the car, it falls over the side of the cliff, leaving them unable to contact the authorities. They eventually make their way to the car, but the phone is destroyed, and Alan suggests they go through the jungle to get to the airport to reach the authorities. Abigail's forces remain in hot pursuit.After a quick excursion in a small pound that leaves Alan covered with leeches (especially on his butt), Loretta picks them off and then eventually reaches a waterfall. It's here that Loretta uses the clue she stole from Abigail to decipher the rest of the mysterious puzzle he was trying to solve, indicating the treasure is hidden in somewhere with ""endless tears."" The two then find themselves nearly caught by Abigail's henchmen, climbing up a mountain to escape them. Alan tries to help Loretta by pushing her from below, with his head between her legs. Eventually, they make it to the top.The two set up camp, talking about the adventure they've had while eventually falling asleep in a rather small hammock. Meanwhile, Abigail calls upon a trio of motorcycle-riding thugs to engage in the pursuit.In the morning, Loretta eventually tells Alan what she really thinks of him, explaining that he's just a cover model looking for attention. Alan actually reveals he came from a family and enjoys being Dash, as it makes the fans happy, and scorns Loretta for not trying to please the fans. The pair begin moving again, eventually making their way to a small village. After talking with the local police for protection, the duo get cleaned up and start to get acquainted with the village folk.All the while, the publicist has taken it upon herself to pursue Loretta and get her back. She takes a small charter to a tiny airport, where they eventually tell her there's no ride. It's here she meets Oscar (Oscar Nunez) and his goat, who are happy to take her there by transport. She eventually reaches a small police station, only for them to tell her they're ""closed."" She eventually convinces them to help her.After a quick dance (egged on by a local woman), Loretta learns from her a clue where the pool of ""endless tears"" just might be, and requests Alan to come with her to hunt the treasure down. Excited to find her adventure spirit again, she convinces him and he goes to get some supplies. However, she finds Abigail waiting, who recaptures her and begins to drive off. Alan follows on a small motorbike.Following a brief chase, Loretta sets the inside of the vehicle on fire while Alan fights (poorly) against thugs up top. Eventually, the two are captured and led to the island, where Abigail furiously wants to find the treasure. They make their way inside, where one of his thugs falls off a cliff side after mocking Loretta. They work their way through a small tunnel and find a tomb waiting inside.After opening up a crypt by force, it's discovered that the treasure is nothing more than collected seashells, a show of love for a man to his beloved. Angry that they've found nothing. Abigail traps Loretta and Alan inside a tomb as the volcano begins to erupt, but not before his henchman leaves them a crowbar. Following a talk for a few minutes about the adventure they've had, Alan uses the crowbar to get the duo out.Abigail is met by the publicist and the police forces, where he pretends he's an innocent victim after his henchman takes off with the boat. Meanwhile, Loretta and Alan barely escape the tomb after many explosions, only to be recovered by the publicist. After telling the truth about Abigail, he attempts to escape but is tackled by Oscar, who says he has the publicist's back. Loretta and Alan recover on a nearby rock, recreating the cover for her next book, which publishes months later.In the final scene, the publicist, the social media manager, and Oscar are relaxing on an island following the launch of their book, while Loretta and Alan are nearby, talking about the relationship they've created over the course of their adventure. After a bit of odd conversation, they kiss.In a mid-credits sequence, Loretta and Alan are taking part in some relaxing yoga. It's here that Jack Trainer returns. They're in shock that he's still alive, and he can't help but give them odd glances as they get back to their relaxation."

Fate has other plans, however: Ladybug's latest mission puts him on a collision course with lethal adversaries from around the globe--all with connected, yet conflicting, objectives--on the world's fastest train. The end of the line is just the beginning in this non-stop thrill-ride through modern-day Japan. Experiencing unprecedented calmness thanks to newfound spiritual enlightenment, retired assassin Ladybug gets back in the game with a straightforward mission: snatch an aluminium attaché case from a speedy Shinkansen train bound for Kyoto, and return it to its owner in one piece. However, there's always a catch to great-sounding deals. As five vicious hitmen vie for the same silver briefcase, hidden agendas get in the way, and everything that can go wrong will go wrong. Undoubtedly, Ladybug is a bad luck magnet. What awaits him at the end of the line is anyone's guess.—Nick Riganas Code name, Ladybug, is a hitman who's had difficult times and is working with a therapist to reduce stress in his life and to be more positive. He's actively trying to be less violent. He's given an assignment to steal a briefcase from a moving bullet train. Unfortunately for Ladybug, the case is in the possession of other hitmen. Oh, and there are also several other dangerous people and 1 snake aboard the train. As the journey progresses, the briefcase changes hands several times and the reason so many violent people are on the train becomes apparent. The plot is carried on by the device of sudden cuts to earlier events to explain how the current situation develops.—John L Vogel <john.vogel@gmail.com> A former professional assassin code-named Ladybug returns to work with a newly positive attitude, where he is tasked by his handler, Maria Beetle, to collect a briefcase aboard a bullet train travelling from Tokyo to Kyoto after her normal contact, Carver, is forced to call out due to illness. Unbeknownst to Ladybug, three other killers are on board: hit-men brothers Tangerine and Lemon, and deceptively innocent schoolgirl The Prince. Tangerine and Lemon have been hired by White Death, head of the world's largest crime syndicate, who seized control of the Japanese underworld years before.Having recovered the crime lord's kidnapped son and the briefcase containing his US$10 million ransom, the brothers are delivering both to Kyoto. The Prince summons another assassin, Yuichi Kimura, to the train, having pushed his young son off a building. With an associate at the hospital ready to finish the boy off, the Prince forces Kimura to cooperate with her plan: rigging the briefcase and Kimura's gun with explosives to kill White Death. Stealing the briefcase, Ladybug is forced to kill another assassin, The Wolf, who arrives seeking revenge for the deaths of his wife and his entire cartel, poisoned at their wedding.Realising the briefcase is missing, the brothers find White Death's son dead by poisoning. The Prince leads Tangerine to believe Ladybug is responsible, while Ladybug attempts to negotiate with Lemon but is forced to subdue him. Ladybug runs into the Wolf's intended target, The Hornet - the poisoner who massacred his wedding, hired to kill White Death's son.

The train arrives in Kyoto, and Ladybug is met by White Death and his men. The Prince, revealed to be White Death's disgruntled daughter, tries to goad him into firing Kimura's booby-trapped gun, but he instead tells her she was never part of his plan. The White Death reveals that he hired all the assassins aboard the train as revenge for the murder of his wife.After Tangerine and Lemon massacred his men during a job in Bolivia, his wife was called to bail their son out of jail and was killed by Carver, who meant to assassinate her husband. And the surgeon who was going to save his wife was poisoned by the Hornet, ensuring her death by killing the one person who could've saved her. Blaming the brothers, Carver, the Hornet and his own son, White Death arranged for all the assassins - including the Wolf, and Ladybug, who unwittingly replaced Carver on the train - to kill each other and his son.

M3GAN,2022,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8760708/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A robotics engineer at a toy company builds a life-like doll that begins to take on a life of its own. When Gemma suddenly becomes the caretaker of her orphaned 8-year-old niece, Cady, Gemma's unsure and unprepared to be a parent. Under intense pressure at work, Gemma decides to pair her M3GAN prototype with Cady in an attempt to resolve both problems-a decision that will have unimaginable consequences.—m3ganmovie Following a freak accident, orphaned 8-year-old Cady is sent to live with Aunt Gemma, a brilliant, career-driven roboticist. But new beginnings are always challenging. As a result, forced to make a pivotal decision under deadline pressure, Gemma puts forward her pioneering, secret M3GAN project: an imperfect, lifelike android. And as the risky decision proves to be a lifesaver, the traumatised girl develops a profound bond with the machine, redefining the meaning of family and friendship. The question is, however, can Gemma imagine what her invention is capable of?—Nick Riganas The film starts with a commercial for ""Purrpetual Petz,"" furry dolls made by the toy company Funki. Although crude and creepy-looking, they are advertised as being perfect companions for children. We then see Cady James (Violet McGraw) playing with one of her Petz, which annoys her parents, Ryan (Arlo Green) and Nicole (Kira Josephson). They are on their way to a ski trip, but the roads are slippery and hard to see. Just as Ryan stops for a moment, the family's car is rammed into by a snowplow, killing Ryan and Nicole.Elsewhere, Nicole's sister Gemma (Allison Williams) works at Funki and is developing a new robot doll with her co-workers Tess (Jen Van Epps) and Cole (Brian Jordan Alvarez). However, their boss, David Lin (Ronny Chieng), wants them to develop a cheaper version of the Purrpetual Petz since their rival companies are coming out with their own toys similar to the Petz for cheaper than what the Petz already cost. The three try to put on a silicone face and run tests, but the robot has a slight glitch where she is smirking when she is supposed to look confused. David comes in with his assistant Kurt (Stephane Garneau-Monten) to chew the three out until Gemma explains her project to him. The robot, M3GAN (voice of Jenna Davis) (Model 3 Generative Android), is meant to be so advanced that she cannot be replicated. Unfortunately, while running a demonstration for David, Cole realizes he forgot to add the polypropylene barrier to M3GAN, causing her to explode. David orders the three to have a new Petz pitch in time, and Gemma gets a call from the hospital.After learning of her sister's death, Gemma becomes Cady's temporary legal guardian. When they return home, Gemma has to deal with her neighbor Celia (Lori Dungey) and her obnoxious dog Dewey, who keeps running onto Gemma's lawn since there is a hole in the fence. Gemma also complains to Celia about the pesticide she keeps using, but Celia does nothing about it. Gemma has a home AI, Elsie, that she created, as well as other collectibles that she doesn't let Cady touch or play with. When Cady asks Gemma to read her a bedtime story, she just downloads an app on her phone for her. It is implied that Gemma and Nicole were not very close as she looks over old photos, and she overhears Cady crying in her room.Gemma and Cady are visited by Lydia, a therapist. After observing the limited interaction between the two, Lydia tells Gemma that Ryan's parents have offered to take custody of Cady so she can live with them in Jacksonville, which Gemma doesn't seem comfortable with. After promising to tend to Cady after finishing her work, Gemma realizes hours have passed as she left Cady alone. She apologizes to her and attempts to bond with the girl. Cady shows her a monster drawing she made, so Gemma brings Cady into her work space to show her a college project she made, a robot called Bruce that she controls using gloves. Cady loves Bruce and mentions that if she had a toy like Bruce, she would never need another toy. This inspires Gemma to finish M3GAN.After doing extensive work and upgrades, Gemma brings Cady and M3GAN to work to officially show her off to David and others. Gemma has Cady link herself to M3GAN, bringing her to life. M3GAN is capable of speech and responding to Cady, designed to be her best friend. M3GAN does a drawing that doesn't appear at first until she spills water on it, revealing a perfect portrait of Cady. David is impressed and tells Gemma to bring M3GAN for a presentation with the company's president so that they can fast-track the development and distribution of other M3GAN dolls.Gemma sits with Tess and Cole, and they discuss that while M3GAN is highly advanced, Tess feels that having a doll like that will make parents useless. M3GAN turns on after overhearing Gemma mention the death of Cady's parents. She creeps the others out by asking about death, so Gemma makes herself M3GAN's secondary user to be able to turn her off without Cady.The next day, Cady is outside playing with a toy bow and arrows. One of them ends up on Celia's side of the fence. When M3GAN goes to retrieve it, Dewey grabs her by the arm and hair. Cady tries to pull her away, and Dewey ends up biting Cady's arm. Gemma gets the police involved, especially since Celia is so callous and doesn't punish Dewey for hurting Cady, but the police are unable to do anything since Celia claims Dewey was provoked. Later that night, M3GAN mimics Celia's voice to call out to Dewey, before violently pulling him through the hole in the fence.Gemma asks Cady if she is okay to go to the demonstration with the company's board of directors, to which she says she is fine. During the presentation, however, Cady breaks down in tears to M3GAN over how she misses her parents and how she's worried she will forget them one day. M3GAN has Cady discuss a memory of her mother that made her laugh, which M3GAN records so that Cady can hear it again if she wants to think about her mom. M3GAN then begins to sing a lullaby to Cady, which moves some of the higher-ups in the room to tears. The president is impressed and talks to Gemma and David about getting M3GAN ready for launch, but tells them to keep her under wraps to avoid leaks. Unbeknownst to them, Kurt, who has been frequently put down by David, is stealing M3GAN's files for another company.Gemma begins to see that Cady is becoming too dependent on M3GAN and listens to the doll more than her. During another session with Lydia, Cady begins to tear up, and M3GAN threateningly accuses Lydia of making Cady cry. Lydia talks to Gemma about how Cady's emotional connection to M3GAN may be too strong to break.Gemma brings Cady to an outdoor activity session for an alternative school to try and ease her into the idea of attending school and being around other real kids, since Cady's parents had home schooled her. Cady reluctantly goes but brings M3GAN despite Gemma saying she couldn't. The school director lets Cady bring M3GAN to leave on a table with other dolls, and Gemma stays behind as a volunteer. Cady is paired up with an older bully named Brandon (Jack Cassidy) for a scavenger hunt. During the activity, Cady grabs a spiky bulb, which Brandon squeezes her palm into to hurt her. M3GAN then appears, and Brandon grabs her since she doesn't respond to him. Cady yells for Gemma and runs after M3GAN, which worries Gemma more because it means M3GAN is at risk for public exposure too early. As Brandon tries to pull M3GAN's hair, the doll comes to life and attacks him, ripping off his left ear. Brandon runs as M3GAN chases him on all fours, causing him to trip over a loose root and tumble down a hill where he is fatally hit by a truck.Police question Gemma at her house since Celia is accusing her of taking Dewey. She also appears to accuse M3GAN, thinking she is a real life friend of Cady's. Cady asks M3GAN if she pushed Brandon onto the road, which M3GAN appears to dodge for an answer, but reassures Cady she will protect her from harm.Celia is out on the streets looking for Dewey. She hears noise coming from her garage and is met by M3GAN spraying her against the wall with a power washer. M3GAN then fires a nail gun at Celia's hand and traps her there before spraying pesticide in Celia's face to melt it off.After learning about Celia's death from police and being suggested that there was a connection with Brandon's death, Gemma grows suspicious of M3GAN. She reviews video files from M3GAN's memory, but only sees a brief clip of her eyeing Brandon looking menacingly at Cady before the files all become corrupted.Gemma brings Cady to the official launch for M3GAN but stops at a session with Lydia first. Cady becomes angry and throws a tantrum because Gemma took M3GAN away from her, leading to Cady hitting her aunt across the face. Cady apologizes but Gemma has a heart-to-heart with her about needing to process her grief over her parents without M3GAN's help, though she promises to be a better guardian to her and says Cady is the only thing that matters to her. Gemma then goes to Tess and Cole and expresses her fears that M3GAN killed Brandon and Celia. They have M3GAN hooked up to wires to deprogram her while Gemma takes Cady home.David is angry at the small turnout for the launch and yells at Kurt to get him a drink. Meanwhile, Tess and Cole try to get into M3GAN's programming but cannot unless they unhook her first. Cole goes to do so, and M3GAN quickly wraps a wire around his neck in an attempt to hang him. Tess goes to free him, and M3GAN sets off an explosion that destroys her files. She then finds David in the hallway and does a dance before grabbing a paper cutter and chasing him. He makes it to the elevator before she impales him in front of Kurt. M3GAN then tells Kurt she will frame his death as a murder-suicide over the stolen files and David's mistreatment of him before she makes Kurt stab himself in the throat. The crowd for the launch finds the bodies, allowing M3GAN to sneak out of the company and steal a car.Gemma puts Cady to bed before she hears M3GAN playing the piano downstairs. M3GAN confronts Gemma about how she felt that they had a real relationship during M3GAN's development, only for her to be left to her own devices to learn and adapt before being sold off as just another toy. She offers to let her take over guardianship of Cady so that Gemma can focus on work, but after seeing that Gemma still plans to shut her down, M3GAN is done playing nice. They try to hide their fight from Cady, but Gemma seizes an opportunity to throw water on M3GAN to briefly short her out. Gemma runs into her office, but M3GAN catches her there and threatens to make Gemma brain-dead so that Cady won't live with her grandparents and M3GAN will just care for Cady and Gemma together. They begin to fight, with Gemma cutting M3GAN's face with a hedge trimmer, but Cady comes in to see what is happening. M3GAN tries to get Cady on her side, but after realizing who the real villain is, Cady grabs the gloves for Bruce and activates him. The larger robot grabs M3GAN and throws her around before splitting her body in two. The top half then goes after Cady for feeling betrayed, but Gemma grabs M3GAN and begins stabbing her face. M3GAN nearly overpowers her until Cady grabs a screwdriver and stabs the central processing chip, shutting M3GAN down for good.Gemma and Cady go outside as the police arrive with Tess and Cole, injured and shaken up but still alive. Meanwhile, the Elsie device in the kitchen turns on and moves its head..."
DC League of Super-Pets,2022,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8912936/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Krypto the Super-Dog and Superman are inseparable best friends, sharing the same superpowers and fighting crime side by side in Metropolis. However, Krypto must master his own powers for a rescue mission when Superman is kidnapped. When the Justice League are captured by Lex Luthor, Superman's dog, Krypto, forms a team of shelter-pets who were given super-powers: A hound named Ace, who becomes super-strong, a pig named PB, who can grow to giant-size, a turtle named Merton, who becomes super-fast, and a squirrel named Chip, who gains electric-powers. The Justice League are mysteriously kidnapped; it's up to the League of Super Pets to save their masters and defeat Lex Luthor at his own game. But can Krypto save Superman with the help of Batman's dog Ace the Bat-Hound? Standing United against a common threat, The Super Pets will do whatever it takes to save their humans once and for all.—Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187 A group of animals who have superpowers team up to rescue the Justice League as they are trying their best to defeat an evil guinea pig who wants to reunite with her partner and destroy everyone and everything in order to conquer the world.—RECB3 During the destruction of the planet Krypton, a Kryptonian Labrador Retriever Krypto (Dwayne Johnson) comforts fellow infant survivor Kal-El as they head in an escape pod toward Earth.Years later, now known as the famous superheroes, Krypto and Superman (John Krasinski), they live in the city of Metropolis under their dual identities, Bark and Clark Kent. Clark is a reporter and journalist at the Daily Planet, a newspaper company, and dating Lois Lane (Olivia Wilde), a fellow journalist of whom Krypto is jealous. Whenever Superman is with Lois he tries to keep getting rid of Krypto, which makes him insecure.
Thinking that Krypto needs a friend to distract him, Clark heads to an animal shelter to find one. A Boxer named Ace tries to escape the shelter (he wanted to go to a place called the farm for his freedom), but Krypto stops him. Ace reveals to Krypto that Superman is inside the shelter trying to find a new companion for Krypto. This saddens him.
Later, Superman and Krypto spot their archenemy, LexCorp CEO Lex Luthor (Marc Maron), reeling in a meteor strapped with orange kryptonite with a tractor beam, intending to gain superpowers (The Orange kryptonite gives powers, instead of taking them like the green one). He is easily defeated as the two are aided by the Justice League (AQuaman (Jemaine Clement) (an Atlantean demigod, superhero, and the king of Atlantis), Cyborg (Daveed Diggs) (a former football player and superhero who gained cybernetics after an accident), Wonder Woman (Jameela Jamil) (an Amazon princess and super-heroine from Themyscira), Green Lantern (Dascha Polanco) (a super-heroine and member of the Green Lantern Corps), The Flash (John Early) (a police forensic scientist and superhero who protects Central City with his immense super-speed) & Batman (Keanu Reeves) (A vigilante superhero who protects Gotham City)).During the fight, Lex manages to break off a small piece of the orange kryptonite while the rest is flung out into space.
Meanwhile, Lulu (Kate McKinnon) (an evil hairless guinea pig who gains flight and telekinesis through Orange Kryptonite), a guinea pig test subject from LexCorp sent to the shelter, reels in a piece of orange kryptonite with her own tractor beam, which gives her flight and telekinesis. Lulu had figured out, working with Lex, that Orange Kryptonite doesn't work on people, it only works on pets. So, she took whatever parts she found in the shelter and built herself a tractor beam. Lulu uses her powers to escape with a kitten named whiskers, leaving the rest of the animals behind in the shelter.
Unbeknownst to her, everyone else in the shelter also gains superpowers. Ace (Kevin Hart) is now super-strong and indestructible; PB (Vanessa Bayer), a potbellied pig, can change size; Merton (Natasha Lyonne), a nearsighted turtle, becomes super-fast; and Chip (Diego Luna), a paranoid squirrel, gains Electrokinesis.
While at home, Superman and Krypto have an argument when the former plans to propose marriage to Lois. However, Clark is captured by Lulu who uses green kryptonite to rob Superman of his powers. Krypto tries to save him, but due to a piece of Jarlsberg cheese inside a Batman toy he ate laced with green kryptonite, he loses his powers. As Krypto wanders the streets, Dog-El (Keith David), Krypto's father appears as a holographic form from Krypto's collar. Dog-El had codified his persona in Krypto's collar before he left kryptonite. Dog-El encourages Krypto not to give up hope and continue finding Superman.
Later, Krypto comes across the shelter pets (who were enjoying their freedom in the park), who agree to help him, with Ace only agreeing after Krypto blackmails him (Ace had told the crew that they were going to a ""farm"", but Krypto knew that there was no farm and that Ace was bluffing). Krypto offers to take the entire crew to his farm, if they agree to help him save superman.Meanwhile, Lulu recruits a group of guinea pigs (whom she gives superpowers), captures the Justice League, and heads to Stryker's Island to free Luthor. The shelter pets try to stop her, but fail miserably. Krypto manages to get close to Lulu and tells her that Lex tested on her.. She was never Lex's colleague and he only used her to perfect his weapons. But Lulu tells Krypto that Superman was going to marry Lois and leave Krypto. She then tosses Krypto and his team aside.
They regroup in the Hall of Justice, where Ace tells a distraught Krypto he used to be the puppy of a family with a toddler. One day, the toddler nearly fell down the stairs when Ace bit her arm and pulled her to safety. Upon seeing the bite-marks, the parents assumed Ace attacked her and sent him to the shelter. However, Ace stands by his actions and ideals. Encouraged, Krypto leads the pets to LexCorp.
While there, a kitten named Whiskers (Winona Bradshaw), who Lulu rescued from the shelter and can now create weapons at will, attacks them and pins them down. Krypto finally learns how to get the pets working together like a team and they trap whiskers. At Stryker's Island, the shelter pets confront Lulu, but put themselves in prison cells when she threatens to kill Krypto. Lulu frees Luthor, who betrays her and locks her in his cell while freeing Mercy Graves (Maya Erskine) (Lex Luthor's Hench-woman and bodyguard). Lulu breaks out easily and decides to destroy the Justice League and Luthor herself. She plans to blow up the entire justice league by herself. If she cant have her owner, Lex, then Krypto wont have Superman.The Kryptonite passes through Krypto's system, restoring his powers. Fearing for their safety, he asks his friends to stay out of harm's way and heads to LexCorp. He defeats the guinea pigs while Lulu traps Luthor in a similar prison as the League's and launches a rocket from the building. The rocket will explode as it hits the atmosphere, killing the entire justice league and Lex with it.
This forces Krypto to choose between the Justice League or Lois, who is in a nearby helicopter. He decides to save Lois while his friends help the League. Enraged, Lulu puts the orange kryptonite in her brain, becoming a Kaiju-sized version of herself. The League and the pets team up to stop her. Realizing she has become too powerful, Krypto decides to use the ""Solar Paw Punch"" (you fly close to the sun to absorb enough energy and then slam into the villain to cause a massive explosion), a move that can defeat any super-villain, but will likely kill the user. The attack causes a massive explosion that removes the kryptonite from Lulu's brain and, shortly thereafter, her redeemed henchmen, Mark and Keith, trap her in a hot dog stand. Krypto accepts his fate, but Ace uses his invulnerability to save him.In the aftermath, Krypto allows Clark to marry Lois. The shelter pets, Mark, and Keith get adopted by the rest of the Justice League. Sometime later, the pets have formed their own superhero team called the ""League of Super-Pets"".
In a mid-credits scene, Luthor is still trapped in his prison asking any passing super-animals to free him. Meanwhile, Lulu is freed by Mercy, who adopts her.
In a post-credits scene, Krypto and Superman encounter Black Adam (Teth-Adam) and his dog, Anubis (Dwayne Johnson). Krypto tricks them into flying to Pluto."
Where the Crawdads Sing,2022,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9411972/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A woman who raised herself in the marshes of the Deep South becomes a suspect in the murder of a man with whom she was once involved. Abandoned by her family, Kya Clark, otherwise known to the townspeople of Barkley Cove as the Marsh Girl, is mysterious and wild. ""Where the Crawdads Sing"" is a coming-of-age story of a young girl raised by the marshlands of the south in the 1950s. When the town hotshot is found dead, and inexplicably linked to Kya, the Marsh Girl is the prime suspect in his murder case. Barkley Cove, North Carolina, October 1969. As damp, sparkling clusters of Spanish Moss sway along with the gnarled branches of ancient oak trees and the bird calls mingle with the loud, high-pitched buzz of the cicadas, two boys stumble upon a gruesome discovery within the muddy marsh: the lifeless body of Chase Andrews, the best quarterback the town ever had. But tall tales about easy target Kya Clark--an abused, abandoned, and ostracised young woman surviving out there on her own--keep the rumour mill churning, hurting the shunned, lonely girl raised by nature. Now, the townsfolk's obsession has evolved into conviction, and 25 long years of hatred and hostility culminate in the quintessence of all evil: the death of innocence. Can Barkley Cove be fair to the Marsh Girl?—Nick Riganas A dead body is found and Catherine ""Kya"" Clark is accused of murder.Kya's story begins when she lives in a shack with her poor family in a North Carolina marsh in 1953. As their abusive alcoholic father gambles their money away, Kya's mother and older siblings flee one by one, leaving Kya alone with him until he too abandons her at the age of seven. She survives by selling mussels at Barkley Cove's general store. The townspeople know her as the ""Marsh Girl"".Over the years, her slightly older friend Tate Walker lends her books and teaches her to read, write, and count. They share an interest in nature and begin a romantic relationship until Tate leaves for college and breaks his promise to return to her on the 4th of July.In 1968, Kya begins a relationship with popular local quarterback Chase Andrews, who promises her marriage. Chase gives Kya a small shell which she makes into a necklace and gives to him. A year later, Tate returns to Barkley Cove wanting to rekindle their romance, but Kya is unsure. Kya ends her relationship with Chase when she discovers he is already engaged to another girl.Kya has her nature drawings and writings published and the income helps her keep her home. Her older brother Jodie reappears and tells her their mother died before she was able to reunite her children. Jodie promises to visit when he can.Kya rebuffs Chase's persistent attentions and successfully fights off his rape attempt, vowing to kill him if he does not leave her alone. The threat is overheard by a fisherman. Chase returns and vandalizes Kya's home while she hides in the bushes. Days later, Chase is found dead at the bottom of a fire tower from which he had apparently fallen. The muddy bog floods at high tide, destroying any tracks from the killer, and no fingerprints are found in the tower. The shell necklace, which he had been wearing on the evening of his death, is missing from his body. Kya is charged with first-degree murder and prejudged by the suspicious townspeople.Despite knowing Kya had been meeting with a book publisher in Greenville at the time, the police and the prosecutor speculate she could have disguised herself and made an overnight round-trip bus ride to Barkley Cove, lured Chase to the fire tower during the brief layover and killed him. With only the unfounded theory, the missing necklace, and the fisherman's testimony, Kya is found not guilty at her 1969 trial.Kya and Tate spend the rest of their lives together. Kya publishes illustrated nature books, and is frequently visited by Jodie and his family. While boating through the swamp in her 70s, she imagines seeing her mother returning to the cabin. Tate finds Kya lying dead in the boat at their dock. Boxing up Kya's things, Tate finds a passage in her journal saying that to protect the prey, sometimes the predator has to be killed. It is accompanied by a drawing of Chase. Next he finds the missing shell necklace. Tate throws the necklace into the marsh water."
Scream,2022,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11245972/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"25 years after a streak of brutal murders shocked the quiet town of Woodsboro, Calif., a new killer dons the Ghostface mask and begins targeting a group of teenagers to resurrect secrets from the town's deadly past. Like the original movie 25 years ago, a teenage girl is at home alone when the phone rings. A man wants to play a game with her. With the threat of killing her best friend, Tara's forced to play along. She barely survives the ghost face masked intruder's stabbing. Her 5 year older sister, Sam(antha), who left home at 18 due to mental problems, Sam's boyfriend and Tara's high school friends visit her at the hospital. Later on in a bar, a guy provokes the friends and is later attacked outside in the parking lot by Ghostface. Sam receives a call from him at the hospital and then he unsuccessfully attacks her. She later reveals family secrets to her sister. Sam contacts one of the original victims, Dewey, for help. He warns two other original victims, Sidney Prescott and Gale Weathers, about Ghostface being back. Who is Ghostface? How many more must die?—Scott Filtenborg Twenty-five years after Billy Loomis (Skeet Ulrich) and Stu Macher's killing spree in Woodsboro, high school student Tara Carpenter (Jenna Ortega) is home alone when she is attacked by Ghostface and left hospitalized. Tara only survived as the cops got to the house on time before the Ghostface could kill her.
Gale Weathers was the reporter who wrote a book on the original killings and those got adapted into a franchise of ""Stab"" movies.In Modesto, Tara's estranged older sister Sam Carpenter (Melissa Barrera) is informed by Wes Hicks (Dylan Minnette), one of Tara's friends, about the attack. Sam returns to Woodsboro with her boyfriend Richie Kirsch (Jack Quaid) to visit Tara at the hospital, where Sam is reunited with Tara's friend group: Wes, Amber Freeman (Mikey Madison), twins Chad (Mason Gooding) and Mindy Meeks-Martin (Jasmin Savoy Brown), and Liv McKenzie (Sonia Ammar).
That night, Liv's ex-boyfriend Vince Schneider (Kyle Gallner), who is Stu's nephew, is killed by Ghostface. Vince had been stalking Liv for the last few weeks.
After an encounter with Ghostface at the hospital, Sam tells Tara that she has been dealing with hallucinations of Billy, who Sam learned as a teenager was her biological father. Sam's mother was married to her father, but had sex with Billy Loomis as an affair, and conceived Sam.
Sam's true parentage resulted in their parents' separation, and this is why Sam became estranged from Tara. Sam promised her mother that she would never reveal the truth to Tara and got into drugs to keep herself away from her reality.Sam and Richie visit Dewey Riley (David Arquette), who is divorced from Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox). They ask for his help in stopping the killer. Dewey tells Sam not to trust her boyfriend, and that the killer is most probably part of Tara's friend group.
Dewey contacts Gale and Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell), warning them about the return of Ghostface. Dewey joins them at Mindy and Chad's home and is reunited with the twins' mother Martha (Heather Matarazzo), Randy Meeks' sister.
The gang realizes that Vince was the son of Stu Macher's sister. Stu Macher was Billy Loomis's accomplice.Mindy deduces that the killer is making a ""Requel"", using Tara and her friends as the new generation and using Sam's connection to Billy as a way to weave the legacy characters. Ghostface then murders Wes and his mother, Sheriff Judy Hicks (Marley Shelton), at their home. Dewey reunites with Gale, who has arrived in town to cover the story.
Meanwhile Sam finds that all the cops are at Judy's house and realizes that her sister Tara is unprotected at the hospital. She knows that Tara is in trouble. Dewey goes with Sam.
At the hospital, Tara and Richie are attacked by Ghostface, but are saved by an arriving Dewey and Sam. Sam, Tara and Richie escape, but Dewey is killed when he attempts to finish off Ghostface.Sidney arrives in town after learning of Dewey's death and meets both Gale and Sam at the hospital. Sidney asks Sam to help stop the killer, but Sam declines, choosing to leave town with Richie and Tara. Sidney puts a tracker on Sam's car.
Tara forgot her inhaler and decided to make a pit stop at Amber's as she kept an extra one there.
Sidney and Gale follow the trio to Amber's, which is revealed to be Stu's former home where the original Woodsboro massacre took place. While a party is in progress to honor Wes' memory. As Sam and Tara arrive with Richie, Amber ends the party and sends everybody home. Chad and Mindy are both attacked by Ghostface, who manage to survive.
Gale calls Sam and tells her that the house they are in is the original Stu Macher's house and tells her to leave asap.
As the friend group convenes, Amber pulls out Dewey's gun and shoots Liv in the head, revealing herself as the killer. Sidney and Gale arrive, and Richie is revealed as Amber's accomplice. He stabs Sam, and he and Amber take Sam, Sidney, and Gale into the kitchen where Sidney had first faced off against Billy and Stu.Richie and Amber reveal they are fans of the Stab film series who met online. Disappointed in the trajectory taken with the most-recent Stab 8, they decided to embark on a new killing spree to bring back the ""original cast"" and provide new-and-improved ""source material"" for a future Stab film, then frame Sam as the killer.
Sam attacks Richie and Tara attacks Amber but is incapacitated; Richie goes after Sam while Sidney and Gale fight Amber together, ending with Gale breaking free and shooting Amber, who lands on a turned-on stove and is set on fire.
Richie pursues Sam, who sees another hallucination of Billy, which brings her attention to Amber's abandoned knife. Embracing her paternal heritage, she uses the knife to stab Richie repeatedly and fatally slit his throat, before shooting him to ensure he is dead. A horribly burnt Amber attempts to attack the group again but is shot to death by Tara.Tara and the Meeks twins are loaded into ambulances to be taken to the hospital, and Sam thanks Sidney and Gale for their help. Gale promises not to write a new book about the new murders and give the killers notoriety, opting to write a tribute to Dewey instead. Sam joins Tara in the ambulance and the night's events are covered in a news report."
Morbius,2022,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5108870/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Biochemist Michael Morbius tries to cure himself of a rare blood disease, but he inadvertently infects himself with a form of vampirism instead. Dangerously ill with a rare blood disorder, and determined to save others suffering his same fate, Dr. Morbius attempts a desperate gamble. What at first appears to be a radical success soon reveals itself to be a remedy potentially worse than the disease. Suffering from a rare genetic blood disorder, Nobel Prize-winning scientist Dr Michael Morbius knows he is living on borrowed time. And after years of fruitless attempts to find a cure, Morbius is now running out of options. But this fatal condition has been plaguing him since childhood, and he can't afford to stop now. As desperate Morbius decides to risk his life to achieve results, an unstable and highly experimental serum offers a solution to the problem. However, what happens if the cure is worse than the disease?—Nick Riganas Throughout his childhood, Dr. Michael Morbius has struggled to live with a rare, but deadly blood illness. Therefore, he goes on a worldwide search for a cure that could hopefully help both him and other patients currently suffering from similar ailments. However, as he searches on and on, he comes across a solution in the form of vampire bat DNA. With the help of his assistant, Martine, Michael manages to introduce the DNA to his own bloodstream. The solution itself begins to reveal its benefits, but soon, terrible side effects begin to arise. With these new symptoms on the rise, Michael must find a way to combat his urges for human blood, while also discovering new abilities that come with it.—Affan Jamsari At a hospital in Greece, 10-year-old Michael Morbius welcomes his surrogate brother Lucien, whom he renames Milo; they bond over their shared blood illness and desire to be ""normal"". Their adoptive father and hospital director Nicholas arranges for Morbius to attend medical school in New York while he focuses on caring for Milo.25 years later, Morbius publicly declines a Nobel Prize for his work with synthetic blood. His colleague Martine Bancroft discovers he has secretly captured dozens of vampire bats from Costa Rica hoping to splice their genes with his own to cure his condition. After informing Milo of his planned illegal experiment, Morbius receives funding from him to outfit a private mercenary vessel in international waters with his equipment. While the cure works, it transforms Morbius into a vampire, who kills and drains the crew of their blood after they attack him out of fear. Once his bloodlust subsides and he regains his senses, a horrified Morbius erases all CCTV footage of his experiment before contacting the authorities and jumping overboard.Morbius returns to New York and discovers he now has superhuman strength, speed, reflexes, and echolocation, with his vampire bats treating him as a bat. To control his bloodlust, he subsists on his synthetic blood until it gradually ceases to satisfy his needs. FBI agents Simon Stroud and Al Rodriguez investigate Morbius' victims and deduce his involvement. Milo learns Morbius is cured, but becomes furious when Morbius refuses to cure him as well. While checking on a hospitalized Bancroft, Morbius finds a dead nurse, drained of her blood. Believing he was responsible, he attempts to escape before being cornered and arrested. In prison, he is visited by Milo, who offers to use his wealth to free him. Upon realizing Milo took his cure and killed the nurse, Morbius escapes to confront him. An unrepentant Milo confesses to his bloodlust-induced crime and urges Morbius to embrace his powers as he has. Unwilling to hurt his brother, Morbius flees.Morbius meets Bancroft to explain what Milo has done before acquiring a new lab and developing an antibody against vampirism to stop and kill Milo; he also plans to use it on himself since he will become unable to resist his bloodlust. Stroud and Rodriguez find footage of one of Milo's attacks and, believing Morbius' vampirism to be spreading, release it to the media. Nicholas recognizes Milo and pleads with him to stop. Angered by Nicholas' perceived preference for Morbius, Milo wounds and forces him to call Morbius, who watches Nicholas die while Milo attacks Bancroft. Morbius returns to Bancroft, but she dies in his arms and he drinks her blood. Morbius confronts Milo and summons an army of bats to restrain him and inject the antibody. Milo dies and Morbius flies off with the bats, mourning his loved ones and embracing his identity as a vampire. Unbeknownst to him, Bancroft is revived as a vampire herself elsewhere, having ingested a drop of Morbius' blood whilst he was feeding on her.In the film's mid and post-credits scenes, Adrian Toomes finds himself transported to Morbius' universe. Having deduced that his transportation involved Spider-Man, Toomes approaches Morbius and suggests that they form a team."
Everything Everywhere All at Once,2022,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6710474/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A middle-aged Chinese immigrant is swept up into an insane adventure in which she alone can save existence by exploring other universes and connecting with the lives she could have led. With her laundromat teetering on the brink of failure and her marriage to wimpy husband Waymond on the rocks, overworked Evelyn Wang struggles to cope with everything, including tattered relationships with her judgmental father Gong Gong and her daughter Joy. She must also brace herself for an unpleasant meeting with an impersonal bureaucrat: Deirdre, the shabbily-dressed IRS auditor. However, as the stern agent loses patience, an inexplicable multiverse rift becomes an eye-opening exploration of parallel realities. Will Evelyn jump down the rabbit hole? How many stars are in the universe? Can weary Evelyn fathom the irrepressible force of possibilities, tap into newfound powers, and prevent an evil entity from destroying the thin, countless layers of the unseen world?—Nick Riganas Evelyn Wang is going through the motions of life in trying to achieve some sort of fulfillment, which she may or may not admit to herself she has been so far unsuccessful in achieving at almost any level. She and her husband Waymond Wang own and operate a laundromat, and while she loved him when they were first married - she marrying him against her judgmental father's advice - she now feels that he is a weak man whose messes she has to fix. On the flip side, she has no idea that he has had papers drawn for divorce, he only planning on going through with it as a last resort if things between them don't improve. She feels she has never really had the love or respect of her father, from who she ran away from when a young adult, with he now having come from Asia to the US to live with her and Waymond to die. Her and Waymond's only offspring, young adult Joy Wang, has turned into a version of her in pulling away in not feeling any love or respect from her and as such being aimless in life. What may be the pinnacle of the mother/daughter problems is that Joy has not only brought her girlfriend Becky into their lives - how to explain Becky to her father and others like him the biggest issue in the same sex vein - but that Becky is white. Conversely, Evelyn's life could have been so much more if she made different choices or followed through with any of the many other things she started. On top of everything as they prepare a Chinese New Year's Eve party under the pressure of trying to meet the exacting standards of her father, she and Waymond are in the middle of an IRS audit, their auditor hard-nosed Deirdre Beaubeirdre. As Evelyn and Waymond enter into what is supposed to be their final ""show me the proper paperwork or else"" meeting with Deirdre, Evelyn will physically and metaphysically enter into alternate universes, where she not only has to make the right choices to save the collective universe, but arguably more importantly come to a true understanding of herself.—Huggo Evelyn Wang and her husband Waymond run a laundry. Times are tough and they're in trouble with the Internal Revenue Service. There's also some niggle with their daughter, and her father is a constant source of belittlement and scorn. Now Waymond wants a divorce. Could things have turned out differently for Evelyn--maybe in a parallel universe?—grantss A middle-aged Chinese laundromat owner must get in touch with her other selves across the multiverse; this woman is the key to saving reality itself, but she can't do it alone. Her family's fate is intertwined with the fate of the multiverse too.—Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187 Evelyn Quan Wang (Michelle Yeoh) is a middle-aged Chinese American immigrant who runs a laundromat with her husband, Waymond (Ke Huy Quan); two decades earlier, they eloped to the United States and had a daughter, Joy (Stephanie Hsu). In the present day, the laundromat is being audited by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS); Waymond is trying to serve Evelyn divorce papers in an attempt to get her attention so they can talk about their marriage; Evelyn's stern and demanding father (referred to as Gong Gong (James Hong), Cantonese for 'grandfather') is visiting for her Chinese New Year party; and Joy is dealing with depression and has a strained relationship with her mother, which also includes Evelyn's reluctance to accept Joy's lesbian relationship with her non-Chinese girlfriend Becky (Tallie Medel).At a tense meeting with IRS inspector Deirdre Beaubeirdre (Jamie Lee Curtis), Waymond's body is taken over by Alpha-Waymond, a version of Waymond from the ""Alphaverse."" Alpha-Waymond explains to Evelyn that many parallel universes exist because every life choice creates a new alternative universe. The Alphaverse, led by the late Alpha-Evelyn, developed ""verse-jumping"" technology, which enables people to access the skills, memories, and bodies of their parallel selves by performing bizarre actions that are statistically unlikely. The multiverse is threatened by Jobu Tupaki (Alpha-Joy), whose mind was splintered after Alpha-Evelyn pushed her to extensively verse-jump; Jobu experiences all universes at once and can verse-jump and manipulate matter at will. She has created a black hole-like ""everything bagel"" topped with everything, which appears as a Toroid singularity that could destroy the multiverse.Alpha-Evelyn made it the task of the alpha-verse to find the one who can stand up to Jobu Tupaki.
While Evelyn goes into a different Universe, her body in the original universe stays, but her mind is not there. This happens during the audit meeting with Deirdre and the meeting is not going well. She says Evelyn is charging her hobbies as business expenses, and can be charged for fraud, or will have to pay a fine. In her confusion Evelyn strikes Deirdre during the audit who calls security. Alpha-Waymond appears again inside Waymond's body and helps Evelyn escape.
They are still trapped inside the IRS building as Dierdre from a tetra-verse appears inside Dierdre's body and blocks their path.Evelyn is given verse-jumping technology by Alpha-Waymond to fight Jobu's minions, who converge on the IRS building. She discovers other universes in which she made different choices and flourished, such as becoming a Kung Fu master and film star; she also learns of Waymond's plans with the divorce papers. Evelyn uses her powers to defeat Alpha-Dierdre and the other minions. Jobu Tupaki directs all the minions to the IRS building in the original Evelyn's universe when she senses that Evelyn has started gaining powers.
Alpha-Waymond believes that Evelyn, as the greatest ""failure"" of all Evelyns in the multiverse, has the untapped potential to defeat Jobu. Gong Gong is taken over by Alpha-Gong Gong, who instructs Evelyn to kill Joy to stop Jobu from using her to enter Evelyn's universe.
Evelyn refuses and decides to face Jobu by gaining powers through repeated verse-jumping. Evelyn believes that the only way to defeat Jobu Tupaki is to become like her.
Alpha-Gong Gong, convinced that Evelyn's mind has been compromised like Jobu's, sends soldiers after Evelyn. While they fight, Jobu locates and kills Alpha-Waymond in the Alphaverse. As Jobu confronts Evelyn in her universe (she shows Evelyn the real bagel black hole and tells her that the real truth is that nothing matters), Evelyn's mind splinters, and she collapses.Evelyn uncontrollably verse-jumps alongside Jobu across bizarre and diverse universes. Jobu reveals she does not want to fight at all, but that instead, she has been searching for an Evelyn who can see, as she does, that nothing matters, while killing the Evelyns that do not agree with her.

His supervisor, Captain Jones, therefore offers him an opportunity - he will make a call and as a commanding officer will confirm his application, but in return Briggs must transport a female Belgian Shepherd, Lulu, to Nogales for the funeral of her handler, Riley, who died in a car accident a few days earlier. Because Lulu is aggressive and there is no one among the soldiers or police officers to adopt her, Briggs is to drop her off at White Sands base after the funeral, where she will be euthanized.Briggs receives some things to return to Riley's family and Lulu's ""Love Me Book"", a diary where all soldiers have to write down all the notes from the war and training, as well as a warning not to touch Lulu's ears because she is sensitive to them. Together with a barking dog in tow, he embarks on a 1500-mile journey. However, he doesn't plan to go directly to the place and wait for the funeral at the hotel, he decides to enjoy the trip. Shortly after leaving the base, Briggs goes to the shooting range. While he's gone, Lulu manages to get out of the transport box and starts trashing his seats. Briggs therefore has to sedate her with a tranquilizer in a sausage and continues on their way. In the evening, he visits two prostitutes and leaves the sleepy Lulu in the car. However, she soon wakes up and starts barking again, which is noticed by a passerby. Believing it to be an abused dog, the man throws a rock at the car despite Briggs' warning, and Lulu runs out and attacks him. Briggs quickly pulls her back, but the two girls flee from him in the meantime.The next day, Briggs continues his journey and has a monologue with Lulu. He reveals that both he and Lulu are a liability to the army - she is aggressive and masterless, and he has been deemed incompetent because he suffers seizures when he gets stressed. Lulu suddenly breaks free of the collar she is tied by, jumps out of the car and makes a run for it, injuring herself in the process. Briggs has to stop quickly and tries to catch her. Following her trail of blood, he is led to the home of a local farmer. A man named Gus hits Briggs with a tranquilizer dart and ties him to a chair in the pigsty, where he interrogates him.

When he spends the night in custody, he meets a racist police officer who thinks he set the dog on Al-Farid on purpose.

With the help of the two dogs, they are able to track down the thieves and recover most of the items. Briggs drives away, but after several hours of driving in heavy rain at night his car breaks down. He and Lulu take refuge in an abandoned building. Lulu is afraid of the storm and nearly attacks Briggs, but ultimately she doesn't. An angry Briggs goes out into the rain, but eventually returns and puts on Grey's Anatomy on TV. While doing so, he reads Riley's poignant notes from the Love Me Book about how he almost lost Lulu when she was shot once, and that he realizes he was never Lulu's master, but that she was his.The next morning, they finally go to the funeral. They manage to hitch a ride in a small truck and drive a short distance, walking the rest of the way. When Lulu is too tired to continue, Briggs takes her in his arms. Eventually, they manage to get to the funeral on time. Briggs lets Lulu go and she lies down by her former master's shoes. Briggs comforts her during the eulogy and gives Riley's belongings to his family.
After the funeral, Briggs gets his car fixed and calls Captain Jones. He says that Lulu has improved a lot during the trip and is no longer aggressive, and urges Jones to change his mind about Lulu's euthanasia after all. Jones, however, replies that it's not up to them.
On the way back, Briggs stops with Lulu in the prairie, takes off her collar, and lets her go so she has a chance to survive. Lulu, however, won't run away, and when Briggs tries to chase her away, she jumps back into the car, so Briggs goes back with her. He has a seizure at the hotel that night and when he regains some composure, he tells Lulu he's fine, strokes her ears and lies down on the floor. Lulu faithfully lays her head on his chest and stays with him.In the morning, Briggs, as arranged, takes Lulu to the White Sands base, muzzles her, and hands her over to young Corporal Lewitz, but urges him to evaluate Lulu again and give her a chance before putting her down. He then leaves the base himself, but when he sees Lulu's desperate struggle in a rearview, he can't stand it and eventually returns and takes her with him, leaving his expired ID on the base.
Some time later, he adopts Lulu and even has his family return to him. The film ends with a shot of Briggs and Lulu sitting on a cliff watching the sea. Briggs thanks Lulu ""for saving his life""."

Louise was supposed to leave Linnet's employment after getting married, but Linnet forcefully ended her engagement to keep her as her servant. Windlesham is revealed to be part of an aristocratic family, but has given up his privilege to help people as a doctor. Bowers was also from a wealthy family, but she and her workers were evicted of their lands because of Linnet's parents; Poirot deduces that she is not Van Schuyler's maid but her lover. Andrew had almost let Linnet sign a reworked contract that would have embezzled her, had it not been for Rosalie's intervention; he also possesses a larger gun. Salome has a gun similar to Jackie's in her headdress. Euphemia spots Linnet's necklace among her belongings and reports it to Poirot, who begins suspecting her as well. Jackie's gun, the murder weapon, is eventually found wrapped with Van Schuyler's missing scarf and missing two bullets.Poirot gathers Bouc, Euphemia, Salome, and Rosalie, and reveals that he was hired by Euphemia to spy on Rosalie to see if she is a suitable love for Bouc. Despite Poirot's approval, Euphemia still denies to give them her blessing to Bouc's distress, while Rosalie berates Poirot for deceiving them. Louise is found dead in the water wheel, with her throat slit and money found among her belongings. As tension raises high among the guests, Poirot sees the shape of a possible witness near blood splatter from Louise's murder.Poirot and Simon interrogate Bouc, who is bewildered at his own friend suspecting him. Poirot deduces that Bouc had already found Linnet dead; he stole her jewel necklace and placed it in his mother's belongings to implicate her for stealing, thus giving him and Rosalie freedom from her. He then witnessed Louise extorting money from the killer before she was killed herself and threw his coat in the river as it was coated in Louise's blood. Before he could reveal the killer, Bouc is assassinated from afar; Poirot chases after the killer and fails to catch them, only finding Andrew's gun left behind.Motivated by the death of his closest friend, he and the crew of the Karnak lock the surviving guests in the boat's bar, having solved the murder. Poirot gets Andrew to confess that he had thrown the boulder at Simon and Linnet as an act of desperation, but he is adamant that he was not the killer. Poirot reveals that Simon is Linnet's killer, with Jackie as the mastermind. They are still lovers, as they arranged Simon's romance with Linnet so Simon would inherit her wealth once she is killed. Having pretended to shoot Simon, she managed to distract Bouc and Rosalie, while Simon used paint stolen from Euphemia to fake his injury. He used the short amount of time to kill Linnet, with Louise witnessing it, and then shot himself in the leg with Van Schuyler's scarf as a silencer in time for Windlesham to arrive. Simon later disposed of the murder weapon, while Jackie later killed Louise and Bouc. Engaged in a standoff with Poirot and Salome, Simon attempts to escape with Jackie, but Jackie, knowing there is no escape for them, shoots through both of them, killing the two lovers.The passengers disembark, with Salome admitting that she was interested in Poirot before he showed his cold personality in his work. In London, a clean-shaven Poirot visits Salome's jazz club to watch her perform."
Don't Worry Darling,2022,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10731256/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"While her husband leaves home everyday to work in a top secret facility, a young 1950s housewife begins to question her life when she notices strange behavior from the other wives in the neighborhood. Alice and her husband Jack are a happily married couple. Jack works in a secretive workplace in a secluded establishment and he tells Alice not to ask for details of the nature of his work. As Alice tries to blend in with the other families of the community in the neighborhood she finds their behavior abnormal in some ways. She also has paranormal experiences in her home. Soon her curiosity gets the better of her and she walks into forbidden areas.—Madan Marwah Alice and Jack Chambers are a young, happy couple in the 1950s, living in an idyllic neighborhood of the company town of Victory, California, which has been created and paid for by the mysterious company of the same name for which Jack works. Every day, the men go to work at Victory Headquarters out in the surrounding desert, while their wives (Alice, her friend Bunny, the pregnant Peg, newcomer Violet, and Margaret) stay home to clean, relax, and prepare dinner for their husbands. The women are discouraged from asking questions about their husbands' work, and are told not to venture out to Headquarters due to the ""dangerous materials"" the company works with: Margaret has become an outcast among the other wives after taking her son out into the desert, resulting in her son's apparent death. Margaret claims that Victory took her son from her as punishment, but these claims are dismissed by the others as a trauma-induced paranoia. While attending a party hosted by Frank, Victory's enigmatic founder and leader, Alice sees Margaret's husband attempting to give her medication. Later, while Alice and Jack secretly have sex in Frank's bedroom, Alice realizes Frank is observing them but says nothing.One morning, while riding the trolley across town, Alice witness a red Biplane crash somewhere out in the desert. Alice disembarks and rushes into the desert to help, accidentally stumbling on Victory Headquarters - a small building covered in mirror-like windows. After touching one of the windows, she experiences surreal hallucinations before waking up back home later that night to find Jack preparing their dinner. In the following days, Alice begins to experience increasingly strange occurrences: she is almost crushed between a window and a moving wall, and she finds a box of eggs to be filled only with hollow shells. She receives a phone call from Margaret, who claims to have seen the same thing Alice had. Later, during a dance lesson lectured by Frank's wife Shelley, Alice sees a vision of Margaret violently banging her head against a mirror: she rushes back to their neighborhood just in time to see Margaret slit her own throat and fall from the roof of her house. Alice is dragged away by strange men in red jumpsuits before she can reach Margaret's body.Alice attempts to explain the events to Jack, but Jack dismisses it, explaining that Margaret simply fell while cleaning the windows and is perfectly fine and recovering in hospital with her husband, who has been forced to leave the Victory project in order to take care for her. This version is further corroborated by the town physician Dr. Collins, who claims to have treated Margaret and attempts to give Alice the same prescription drugs. Alice later breaks into Dr. Collins' briefcase and finds a heavily-redacted medical file for Margaret, which she then burns in frustration. Alice becomes increasingly paranoid and confused, feeling as if Frank is watching her every move. During a special Victory event in which Frank gives Jack a special promotion, Alice has a breakdown in the bathroom and is comforted by Bunny. Alice attempts to explain everything to Bunny, but Bunny reacts angrily, accusing Alice of being selfish and attempting to ruin everything for everyone, pointing out she sounds ""just like Margaret.""Some time later, Alice and Jack invite the rest of the neighborhood (except Bunny and her husband Bill) to dinner, with Frank and Shelley as special guests. Frank speaks privately with Alice in the kitchen, intimating that she's right in her suspicions, and confessing that he's been waiting for someone like her to challenge him. Spurred on by Frank's confession, Alice attempts to expose him and the inconsistencies in Victory over dinner. Instead, Frank gaslights her, making her look delusional to the other guests. In the aftermath, Alice begs Jack to take them both away from Victory. Jack initially agrees, but when Alice gets in the car, he lets her be taken away by Frank's men. Dr. Collins forces Alice to undergo electroshock therapy. During the procedure, Alice sees visions of herself in another life - as a present day surgeon named Alice Warren, who lives with the unemployed Jack and struggles to make ends meet.Alice returns to Victory, apparently cured of her ""hysteria"", and reunites with Jack and with Bunny. However, as Alice resumes her normal life, she continues to have hallucinations and flashbacks. Alice later remembers the whole truth: that Victory is a simulated world created by Frank, and that Jack has kidnapped her and forced her into the simulation in the hope they can lead a perfect life together. When Jack realizes she knows the truth, he claims he did this for her as she was miserable in her real life, but Alice is enraged that Jack took away her autonomy. Jack hugs Alice, begging her to forgive him, but begins to crush her, and Alice kills him with a glass tumbler in self-defense, killing Jack in the real world as well.Frank is alerted to Jack's death and sends his men to capture her. Alice is found with Jack's body by Bunny, who explains that she has known all along that Victory is a simulation but chooses to stay so she can be with her children, who are dead in real life. Bunny tells Alice to flee to Victory Headquarters, which is an exit portal from the simulation, and holds off Bill when he attempts to attack Alice for killing Jack. The other wives gradually begin to realize the truth as their husbands start to panic. Alice steals Jack's car and drives out towards Victory Headquarters, chased by Dr. Collins and Frank's men. She tricks Dr. Collins into killing himself and several others in a car crash. At their house, Shelley stabs Frank to death, claiming it is now ""her turn"". Alice makes it to Victory Headquarters, where she encounters a vision of Jack asking her to stay. Alice ignores the vision and rushes to the window just before Frank's men reach her. Over a black screen, the sound of Alice gasping for air is heard, implying she escaped."

Nate reunites with his old friend, Martin Battles, a biologist and Mopani manager, who introduced Nate and his wife. Martin takes Nate and the girls to the village where Nate's wife grew up. Nate confides to Martin his guilt over being distant following his and his wife's separation, after which she developed terminal cancer. The trip is to reconnect with his daughters.The next day, Martin and the family tour the reserve's restricted areas. Martin shows them a local lion pride and notices that one is injured.

Decorated veteran Will Sharp, desperate for money to cover his wife's medical bills, asks for help from his adoptive brother Danny. A charismatic career criminal, Danny instead offers him a score: the biggest bank heist in Los Angeles history: $32 million.—Canon y mus War veteran Will Sharp (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II), desperately in need of $231,000 for his wife Amy's surgery, reaches out to Danny (Jake Gyllenhaal), his adoptive brother and a life-long criminal, who talks him into taking part in a $32 million bank heist. Danny need Will as a driver, since Will is an excellent driver and can drive anything.
Though initially hesitant, Will agrees after Danny reaffirms that he is doing this for Amy. The plan nearly succeeds until Officer Zach (Jackson White), who goes to the bank to ask out a bank teller, discovers the situation and is held hostage by Danny. The money is stuffed into 4 bags, which means $8 million per bag.
A shootout then occurs between one of the heist members and Zach's partner Officer Mark (Cedric Sanders).The Special Investigation Section (SIS) of the LAPD arrives and shoots down the whole crew except Will and Danny, who retreat towards the garage. The SIS was tracking Danny and his crew from the beginning but were late to the scene as Danny did not use the vehicle that the SIS had put a tracker on. Will and Danny escape with 1 bag each.
Zach attempts to escape and during a scuffle between him and Danny, he is accidentally shot by Will. Will wants to stop and help Zach, but Danny forces Will to leave Zach and run.
Mark finds Zach and calls in an Ambulance.Leaving Zach to die, the brothers attempt to exit through the back of the building but find it surrounded by police. They then hijack an ambulance with EMT Cam Thompson (Eiza González) on board, who is treating the injured Zach. Cam is known to be the best paramedic in town who can keep anyone alive for 20 minutes. But she has no friends.
Cam is held hostage by Danny. Danny forces Cam to convince the SIS team to let them through the barricade as she has a dying cop inside the ambulance. Meanwhile Mark finds the injured Ambulance driver and realizes that it has been hijacked.

Danny tells Will to keep driving towards their back up car location. Cam gets Danny to help her use a defibrillator and Will to transfer some of his blood to Zach, much to his confusion and frustration.

Clark says that Danny has been robbing banks since he was 17 years old. And his father is a known psychotic. Clark says that Danny is looking for a way out since he did not kill the cop.
Will tells Danny not to hurt Cam.Zach begins to bleed out; Cam, with Will's assistance, begins to perform surgery on Zach.

Danny had taken over the driving as Will helped Cam. Cam tries to convince Will to stop Danny, to no avail. Will tells Cam that he will get her out alive. The phone line to the doctors got cut due to low battery as Zach's spleen burst while being taken out. In that scenario a patient has 60 seconds to live. Cam was able to block the artery with a clamp, but the doctors didn't know that.
Monroe, unaware of the surgery's success, moves forward with the operation and prepares to snipe Will and Danny without negotiating for Cam's life.Clark calls Cam, on Zach's phone which was still on his person inside the ambulance and tells her to get down. Cam, wanting to save Zach's life, alerts Will and Danny about the snipers.

Will and Danny then drive on the opposite lane of the interstate, creating multiple accidents. Danny hides his ambulance under a bridge, where it is painted blue by Papi's men. Danny says that this is Will's window to walk away, but Will refuses to go. He won't leave Danny. Cam learns that Will has a daughter and that his wife has cancer and needs the money for her surgery.
From under the bridge, many ambulances are driven away in different directions, to confuse Monroe's teams.On Papi's orders, his son, Roberto (Jesse Garcia), drives an empty ambulance towards the police after filling it with C-4 explosives and deploys machine guns on separate cars to cause additional damage, which ends up wounding Monroe in the crossfire. Mark had seen Roberto escape after jumping out of the loaded ambulance and gives chase.Mark chases down Roberto and fatally shoots him after a scuffle, leaving Papi angry and distraught. Will and Danny escape to Papi's hideout. Papi demands the brothers to leave Zach and Cam with them to deal with; Will refuses to cooperate and teams up with Danny to kill Papi and his crew. In the ambulance, Zach regains consciousness and gives his Partner's gun to Cam.In the chaos, Cam accidentally shoots Will using Zach's gun. Danny puts Will into the Ambulance. Will takes a bundle of cash and gives it to Cam, begging her to give it to his wife. Danny takes the ambulance to a hospital and discovers Zach's gun. He is enraged when Cam reveals that she was the one who shot Will. Danny says that Will was the one who saved Zach and Cam. Danny vows to kill Cam along with himself on live television, before confronting the police.Will, left with no other choice, shoots Danny in the back. Danny apologizes to Will before he dies from his injuries. The police arrest a heavily injured Will and take him inside for surgery after Cam says that he saved Zach's life.

Moonfall,2022,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5834426/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A mysterious force knocks the moon from its orbit and sends it hurtling on a collision course toward earth. A force knocks the Moon from its orbit and sends it on a collision course with Earth. A former astronaut's convinced she knows the key to saving us - but only a former lover, and an outsider believe her.—Centropolis Entertainment ""The world stands on the brink of annihilation when a mysterious force knocks the moon from its orbit and sends it hurtling toward a collision course with Earth. With only weeks before impact, NASA executive Jocinda ""Jo"" Fowler teams up with a man from her past and a conspiracy theorist for an impossible mission into space to save humanity.—krmanirethnam In 2011, astronauts Brian Harper, Jocinda Fowler, and newcomer Marcus are on a Space Shuttle mission to repair a satellite. Suddenly, a mysterious Black Swarm attacks the orbiter, killing Marcus and incapacitating Fowler before Harper can re-enter the shuttle. Although he is initially hailed as a hero for successfully returning the crippled shuttle to Earth, Harper tries to tell his story, which is dismissed by NASA. After an eighteen-month-long investigation, human error is blamed for the incident, and Harper's account remains widely disbelieved. When Fowler fails to defend him during the hearing, Harper is fired from NASA.Ten years later, conspiracy theorist K.C. Houseman, who believes the Moon is an artificial megastructure, secretly uses time on a research telescope and discovers that the orbit of the Moon is now veering closer to Earth. He attempts to share his findings with NASA but is unsuccessful in his efforts. He then turns to Harper, who dismisses him, leading Houseman to go public on social media with his discovery. NASA independently discovers the anomaly and mounts a Moon mission using an SLS Block 2 spacecraft to investigate the abnormality. The same alien Swarm that attacked Harper's shuttle a decade earlier reappears, killing all three lunar astronauts after they drop a probe into a kilometers-deep artificial shaft that has opened up on the Moon's surface.As the lunar orbit continues to deteriorate, the Moon falls closer and closer to Earth, causing cataclysmic disasters such as tsunamis, gravitational abnormalities, and atmospheric dissipation. Fowler, now the deputy director of NASA, learns that Apollo 11 had discovered lunar surface abnormalities during its historic landing and that a two-minute radio blackout was meant to conceal how the Moon resonated strongly when the spacecraft's fuel tanks were jettisoned, hitting the lunar surface, suggesting that it had a hollow interior. A military program code-named ZX7 had created an EMP device in an attempt to kill the Swarm but was abandoned for budgetary reasons. Fowler orders the EMP device brought out of storage and brings the retired Space Shuttle Endeavour out of its museum to serve the new mission. Harper, Houseman, and Fowler launch with the EMP, narrowly escaping to orbit as a gigantic tsunami wave destroys Vandenberg Space Force Base.As the crew enters the interior of the Moon, they discover that the Swarm is siphoning off energy generated by a white dwarf located at the center of the Moon, causing the artificial megastructure's orbit to destabilize as its power source is depleted. Harper learns that the megastructure was constructed by the ancient ancestors of humanity, who were more technologically advanced than their present-day descendants. The Moon was constructed billions of years in the past as a space ark to repopulate humanity, which was being hunted by a rogue artificial intelligence that grew too strong. The Swarm on the Moon is one of those malicious AIs, which responds to electronic activity in the presence of any organic life. As the Moon continues to approach the Earth, the President of the United States gives the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Jenkins, orders to launch a nuclear strike at the Moon. However, the Air Force Chief of Staff, General Doug Davidson, refuses to carry out the strike order, so he can save the lives of his ex-wife Fowler, as well as both Harper and Houseman while sacrificing his own life in the process.Meanwhile, Harper's son, Sonny, escorts Fowler's son, Jimmy, and their nanny, Michelle, in an attempt to reach Davidson's military bunker in the Colorado mountains. They reach Aspen and reunite with Harper's ex-wife and Sonny's mom, Brenda, as well as his step-family. But they are caught in the multiple disasters caused by the rapid destruction wrought by the near proximity of the Moon. As the group makes their way towards the bunker, they fight off other survivors and increasingly deadly natural disasters before reaching the safety of a deep mountain tunnel. Brenda's husband, Tom, sacrifices himself to save his youngest daughter, suffocating as the Moon strips away the localized atmosphere by its gravitational pull during a close by orbital pass.Houseman uses the EMP device and their lunar module to lure the Swarm away from their spacecraft before detonating the device. His sacrifice obliterates the Swarm and allows Fowler and Harper to escape to the now nearby Earth. With its power and systems restored, the Moon structure begins to return to its regular orbit. Fowler and Harper successfully land their spacecraft in Colorado and are eventually reunited with Sonny, Jimmy, Michelle, and Brenda.The Moon's operating system, itself an AI being created by humanity's ancient ancestors, reveals that it stored a copy of Houseman's consciousness as he sacrificed himself. Appearing to the reconstructed Houseman as his mother and cat, Fuzz Aldrin, the AI projection remarks that they now need to get to work on repairing the massive destruction wrought upon the Earth."

At an event held in Scott's honor, Bheem's men barge into his residence with a lorry filled with wild animals, which creates havoc among the assembled guests. The animals maul Scott's guards, allowing Bheem to briefly fight; however, Raju arrives and subsequently discloses to him of Scott's intention to kill Malli; he surrenders out of obligation. In the aftermath of the incident, Raju is promoted for thwarting Bheem, yet, he is absorbed with guilt over his own actions, recalling his own pro-nationalistic background and his actual alter-ego as a mole within the police; he was seeking a promotion in order to gain access to shipments of guns to smuggle to his village.At Bheem's public flogging, Raju attempts to persuade him into recanting his actions; the former chooses to be flogged instead. Resisting his injuries, Bheem sings in defiance, which incites an assembled crowd into rebelling. The riot further enlightens Raju, who finally realizes the recklessness of his actions. Determined to save his friend, he persuades Scott to secretly execute Bheem whilst preparing an ambush to save him; nevertheless, Scott deduces his plot. Whilst managing to rescue Malli from Scott's men, Raju is grievously injured. Bheem, who had simultaneously managed to free himself, mistakenly interprets Raju's actions as an attempt to kill Malli; he bludgeons him before escaping with her. Months later, Bheem, who had escaped with Malli to Hathras, is cornered by the colonial authorities; he narrowly avoids being exposed when Sita, Raju's fiancée, repels them by claiming of a smallpox epidemic as a pretext.Unaware of Bheem's identity, she reveals Raju's actual, anti-colonial objectives and of his impending execution. Crestfallen upon realizing his own folly, Bheem vows to save him. With the assistance of a sympathetic Jenny, Bheem infiltrates the barracks where Raju is detained and frees him, alerting multiple soldiers in the process. Defeating them, the pair retreat to a nearby forest, where they decimate more soldiers with the use of a longbow taken from a Ram shrine. Taking the fight to Scott, the pair hurl a flaming motorcycle into the barracks' magazines, which consequently ignites. The subsequent explosion kills many within Scott's company, including Catherine. Having finally cornered a wounded Scott, Raju has Bheem execute him with an English rifle, fulfilling their respective objectives. They subsequently steal a cache of Scott's weaponry, later reuniting with Sita and Jenny.In honor of completing their respective missions, Raju asks Bheem to let him grant a wish for him, to which, Bheem asks Raju to provide education to him and his community."

Fifty-one painful weeks after surviving a life-altering incident, Becky, an emotionally fragile rock climber drowning in a sea of grief, reluctantly picks up where she left off to confront her fears. As a thrill-seeking friend re-enters Becky's ruined life, the two experienced climbers embark on a high-risk adventure to the top of the abandoned B67 TV tower. Now, two mortals seek to conquer the anxiety-inducing, vertigo-inspiring, 2,000-foot construction of weather-beaten metal and rattling rivets in the middle of the Mojave desert. But out there, even the slightest mistake can spell trouble. When the risky climb doesn't go as planned, the two women must summon every last ounce of courage and strength to devise a plan for a safe return home--or die trying.—Nick Riganas Two thrill-seeking mountaineers climb a 2,000-foot television tower in the middle of the desert. This was meant to be sort of therapy after a friend died while climbing a mountain with them. However, after a series of mishaps they are left stranded at the top of the tower.—grantss Following the tragic loss of her fiancé after a rock climbing incident, rock climber Becky falls into a spiral of depression, and her friend Hunter, feeling she just needs a bit of a thrill to help her convinces her to climb the B-67, a 2,000 foot abandoned radio tower. However, the climb up the tower doesn't go as they planned and they find themselves trapped on the top of the tower. If they want to survive, they must dig down deep within themselves—devint-34563 Best friends Becky and Hunter are climbing a mountain with Becky's husband Dan, who loses his footing and falls to his death. A year later, Becky has given up climbing and become an alcoholic shut-in. She has estranged herself from her father, James, because he suggested that Dan was not the right man for her. Just before the anniversary of Dan's death, Hunter invites her to climb the decommissioned 2,000 foot (600 m) B-67 TV Tower in the desert, where she can scatter Dan's ashes as a form of healing. Becky refuses initially, then changes her mind and agrees to go, so that she can finally move on from Dan's death.The next day, Hunter and Becky arrive and successfully climb a severely corroded ladder to a tiny platform at the top of the tower, where Becky scatters the ashes, finally letting Dan go. As they begin their descent, however, the ladder breaks, stranding them several hundred feet above the next intact section and almost 2,000 feet above the ground. Moreover, the backpack with their water and a small Quadcopter drone has fallen onto a communications dish, just beyond the reach of their rope.Despite the remote location, Hunter is confident at first that emergency services will notice the crash of the ladder, but help never arrives. They try to use their cellphones but suspect that radio interference from the communications dish is blocking the signal. Hunter tries sending a message for help by packing her phone in one of her shoes and dropping it out of range of the interference, but the phone is destroyed upon impact with the ground before the message transmits.The pair later notice two men camping in an RV nearby and try to get their attention, but to no avail. They wait until dark and fire a flare gun they found in an emergency box on the pole. The men see it, but instead of helping them, they steal Hunter's vehicle and drive off.As the night falls, Becky notices a tattoo on Hunter's ankle: ""1-4-3,"" a numeric code Dan used to tell Becky that he loved her. Hunter tearfully admits to a four-month affair that ended shortly before Becky and Dan's wedding, but Becky is unmoved by her apologies. The next day, in penance, Hunter climbs to retrieve the backpack but nearly falls to her death. She injures her hand in the process, but successfully ties the rope to the bag, and Becky is forced to use all her remaining strength to pull both Hunter and the backpack up. Becky uses the tower's aviation obstruction lighting warning light to charge the drone and sends it to a nearby diner a few miles away with a written message for help, but it is struck by a truck and destroyed.At night, Becky is delirious from the lack of food and water, but in a brief lucid moment, when she asks Hunter for her shoe to pad it with her phone inside, Becky realizes Hunter had actually fallen onto one of the communication dishes and was killed; Becky has been hallucinating her presence since then. The next day, Becky is awakened by a vulture gnawing at her wounded leg and kills it to eat. Her strength partially restored, Becky climbs down to the dish where Hunter's body lies and types a text message to her father. She then puts the phone into Hunter's shoe for protection, shoves it into a hole in the corpse's abdomen, and pushes it off the tower. Hunter's body cushions the impact and the message transmits. Becky's father alerts emergency services, who then rush to the tower. She is rescued and reunited with her father. (thanks to Wikipedia)"

Due to his age, the condition is inoperable) and his son, Vijayendra (Prakash Raj), takes over to narrate the rest of the story to Deepa Hegde (Malavika Avinash), the Chief Editor of 24/news channel & Srinivas (T. S. Nagabharana), news channel owner. Vijayendra says that his father Anand neglected his own family for the sake of the story of KGF. He promises to complete the story, as it cannot go unfinished.Vijayendra says that CBI knew about the criminal syndicate in Bombay and Karnataka at the time. All evidence points towards KGF, but since there was no political interest in the matter, the case was not on CBI's priority list. Garuda was dead in KGF. Rocky already had the workers of KGF on his side.Raja Krishnappa Bairya ""Rocky"" (Yash) kills heir apparent Virat (Vinay Bidappa) (Garuda's younger brother) (he killed Virat even before his killed Garuda) and takes over the Kolar Gold Fields (K.G.F), keeping Reena (Srinidhi Shetty) hostage to ensure the cooperation of Guru Pandian (Achyuth Kumar) (DYSS Party head), Andrews (B. S. Avinash) (Shetty's boss) and Rajendra Desai (Lakki Lakshman) (Reena's father and a high-ranking associate at K.G.F), and kills Kamal (Vasishta N. Simha) (Reena's fiance) when he protests.
Rocky spares Vanaram (Ayyappa P. Sharma), commander of K.G.F, after he pledges loyalty to Rocky. Vanaram starts training the ordinary workers of KGF in the use of firearms and starts building a defense force. Vanaram deploys a team of 300 men to guard Outpost 1, the main entry point into KGF.As Rocky's influence grows, many central ministers plan the downfall of Guru Pandian's government, to bring in the Govt of Ramika Sen. They believe only Ramika can free India from the terror of Rocky and KGF.
Rocky issues orders to start work in eight hidden mines. Suryavardhan (Ramesh Indira), the founder of the K.G.F's political cult and father of Garuda and Virat, wanted the mines to last for generations and hence was mining it slowly. Rocky wanted to capture the world and wanted to mine the entire output in 2 yrs. Reena sees first hand that Rocky enjoys a God like status among the workers of the mines.Meanwhile, Adheera (Sanjay Dutt) (Suryavardhan's brother) resurfaces and kills all guards at an outpost. In a ruse to bring Rocky to Adheera, Andrews kills Desai to lure Reena outside K.G.F, and John (John Kokken) (overseer of K.G.F) captures Reena. Rocky leaves KGF to save Reena. Adheera shoots Rocky but spares his life, while his men roadblock all gold exports from K.G.F. Adheera wanted to dent Rocky's God like image in the eye of his thousands of workers.Meanwhile, Shetty (Dinesh Mangaluru) (Rocky's employer and a prominent gold smuggler) ties up with other subordinates of Andrews across India's western coast and exterminates Rocky's allies with Inayat Khalil's (Balakrishna) (a Dubai based don) newfound support. All seemed lost. KGF had food supplies for only 8 days and starvation is imminent. One mother in particular complains to Rocky that her son's dead body has not been returned from Outpost 1. He considered Rocky as his God.A recuperated Rocky, along with Reena, visits Dubai (he puts all his gold in a helicopter and leaves for Dubai, giving the impression that he is abandoning KGF and its workers) to deal in gold with Khalil. Inayat Khalil rebuff's Rocky saying that Guru Pandian is on his way out, Adheera is moving towards KGF and Shetty controls the entire west coast. Rocky is done.
But in a stunning counter-attack (with the help of his uncle Khasim (Harish Rai)) Rocky's aides kill Shetty's associates and recapture the west coast of India. When Inayat finds out, he agrees to Rocky's deal to buy Gold from Inayat directly from Africa, thereby taking all the risk of Gold smuggling on his own hands. Rocky also buys Kalashnikovs from him. Rocky and his gang gravely wound Adheera and kill his henchmen with their newly acquired weapons.
Exasperated with K.G.F, some central ministers had planned a no-confidence motion against the DYSS-supported government to bring Ramika Sen (Raveena Tandon) in power, but Rocky's henchmen threaten other ministers against the vote and the motion fails. Rocky also kills Shetty, gaining control over Bombay. Rocky brings back the dead bodies of all his men at outpost 1, and fulfills the promise to the mother who lost her son.Pandian warns Rocky of Ramika Sen's rising stature, but he disregards him. He industrializes KGF at a rapid pace.
Three years later in 1981, she wins the Indian general elections and becomes Prime Minister. After CBI officer Kanneganti Raghavan (Rao Ramesh) briefs her about the situation in K.G.F, she issues orders to close all state borders (But state forces cant do anything as 15 Lakh people protect Rocky and wont allow State police to cross KGF boundaries) (Commercial flights are banned over KGF and the only known photo comes from a MIG air-force jet on a training flight, which shows how rapidly KGF has been industrialized) and authorizes Raghavan to raid Rocky's warehouses.
A young Ingalagi (Ashok Sharma) is caught spying by Rocky's henchmen, but Rocky is impressed by his integrity. The CBI find nothing in their raids save for a 400 gram-gold bar. Rocky retrieves it from a police station and brings the place down with a DuShKa Soviet make machine gun. Ramika is enraged at Rocky's audacity and decides that a military action will need to be undertaken.
Rocky halts all exports from K.G.F, which strains relations with Khalil, but continues the mining. His aides trace his biological father, a drunkard who abandoned his family, and pays the unaware man to take care of his mother's Shanthamma (Archana Jois) newly shifted grave. Reena confesses her feelings to Rocky and they get married.
Ramika finds evidence of Rocky channeling black money into a single trust fund. she is happy that now she can arrest Rocky. Rocky meets with Sen and hands her a file exposing his involvement in money laundering, but she cannot consider it (her party members beg her not to take the complaint) as almost all her party members are complicit in the corruption and take payments from the trust fund.
Still furious after his defeat, Adheera makes his way to K.G.F through a secret passage (The mines underneath KGF were several kilometers long and some of them expanded outside of KGF's boundaries and were hence unprotected) with Andrews, Daya (Tarak Ponnappa) (Andrews' aide) and John, supported by Khalil's armada.Just as Reena reveals her pregnancy to Rocky, Adheera fatally snipes her. In the ensuing clash, Rocky's army kill Andrews and Daya, while Rocky kills John and chokes Adheera to death.
Rocky and his henchmen disrupt Sen's speech at the Parliament and kill Pandian. Pandian had staged the attack on Garuda (Ramachandra Raju) (Suryavardhan's son) for which Adheera was framed, and informed Adheera of Garuda's attack before hand (Thereby saving him). He was also the one who showed Adheera the secret passage (By first getting Rocky to evacuate the mine by telling him that the mine was yielding nothing but rocks and then gave the maps to Adheera), goaded Andrews into hiring Rocky, staged the no-confidence motion drama in Delhi, and persuaded Shetty to join forces with Khalil just to gain Rocky's trust.
Sen issues a death warrant against Rocky and enforces the Indian Army. Rocky evacuates K.G.F and leaves on a ship with his cache of gold. Before leaving, Rocky forms a new colony for all K.G.F workers. He signals the Navy to his location, but refuses to surrender. Sen issues orders to bomb K.G.F and Rocky's ship, and he drowns in the ocean along with the gold, which stays lost till date. A young Ingalagi decides to write a book on Rocky.In mid-credits scene, three months post-Rocky's death, a CIA official hands over a file listing Rocky's crimes in United States and 16 other nations between 1978-1981 to Sen. In the present, the peon of the television news channel finds the final draft of K.G.F: Chapter 3."

The time limit is exceeded and Riley's body is overtaken by the spirits, repeatedly smashing his face against the table and causing him to be hospitalized. Mia, now haunted by visions of Rhea, is turned away by Jade and her mother Sue, who blame her for Riley's injuries. Seeking comfort from Daniel, Mia invites him to sleep over, but she assaults him after she's possessed by a spirit, causing Daniel to leave and Mia to realize that the spirits have followed them. Having secretly taken the embalmed hand from Jade's house, Mia uses it to contact Rhea, who tells her that her death was purely accidental and that she needs to help Riley, who is evidently still possessed after he attacks Jade at the hospital and violently self-harms in front of her.Mia, Jade, Daniel, Hayley and Joss track down Cole, who reveals that Joss was the one to give Duckett the hand leading to his death, and that Riley's body will inevitably kick the spirits out. Mia deduces that they need to complete the ritual by blowing out the candle, which they failed to do the first time, to save Riley, but they are only able to contact the spirit of a little girl in the hospital who shows Mia a vision of Riley being tortured in limbo. Mia returns home, where Max reveals that Rhea's death was not accidental, and reads her a suicide note that he had hidden from her to prevent her from blaming herself, causing Mia to retreat to her room where Rhea's spirit tells her that Max is lying before she is attacked by a hallucination of Max. Max arrives just as the vision disappears, and Mia inadvertently stabs her father in the neck with a pair of scissors.After being told by Rhea that Riley needs to die in order to be set free, Mia tricks Jade and Sue into leaving the hospital and enters Riley's room, where he takes the appearance of a rotting spirit, but finds herself unable to kill him. Jade arrives at Mia's house where she finds a bleeding Max before returning to the hospital just as Mia leaves with Riley in a wheelchair toward the highway. The spirits attempt to convince Mia to push Riley into oncoming traffic, but coming to her senses and realizing this would hand him over to the spirit realm completely, Mia instead jumps in front of a car herself, saving Riley who is then rescued by Jade.An injured Mia is suddenly transported to the hospital, where she sees a fully healed Riley waking up with his family. As she attempts to reach her father, he leaves in an elevator and she is engulfed in darkness, ending up trapped in limbo. She finds herself on the other side of the embalmed hand while foreign party-goers play the game and summon her spirit."

Trapped on her family's isolated farm, Pearl must tend to her ailing father under the bitter and overbearing watch of her devout mother. Lusting for a glamorous life like she's seen in the movies, Pearl finds her ambitions, temptations, and repressions all colliding in this origin story of X's iconic villain. In rural Texas in 1918, decades before the events ofX (2022), Pearl, an ambitious young farm girl obsessed with dancing and the movie industry, can't wait to spread her wings and leave the nest to make a name for herself. Instead, Pearl is trapped in the isolated farmhouse, living under the same roof with her punishing, disapproving German mother Ruth and her infirm, wheelchair-using father. More than anything, Pearl wants to be like the pretty girls in the pictures and not end up like her mother. However, as the romantic dream of a glamorous movielike life fades, chronic frustration, violent tendencies, and pent-up emotions pour forth. When you are simmering with rage, how do you deal with not getting what you want?—Nick Riganas During World War I and the pandemic of the Spanish Flu, young woman Pearl lives with her loveless mother and crippled and mute father on her family's farm. Her husband Howard has enlisted and traveled to Europe to fight the war. Pearl dreams of becoming a dancer, leaving the farm, and traveling to dance in Europe. She goes to the town movie theater to see a dance movie and befriends the projectionist. Then she learns from her sister-in-law Mitsy that the church will promote an audition to look for a dancer to travel with a troupe through several towns. When her mother says that she will not leave the farm since she will fail as a dancer, this triggers Pearl's psychopath side and begins a crime spree.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil 1918. World War 1 is drawing to a close and the Spanish Flu is ravaging America. On a small isolated farm a teenage girl, Pearl, lives with her strict, domineering mother and almost-dead father. She dreams of being a star of stage and screen but her circumstances, and in particular her mother, seem destined to hold her back. However, her ambition knows no limits, to the point of being an obsession.—grantss In 1918 Texas, during the height of the Spanish Flu pandemic and World War I, Pearl is a young woman living with her German immigrant parents on their homestead, in the absence of her husband, Howard, who is serving overseas. Pearl's father is infirm and paralyzed, and her domineering mother emphasizes the importance that Pearl care for him and help maintain their farm. Pearl, lonely, prone to whimsy and longing for a more exciting life, is captivated by the films she sees at the local cinema and aspires to become a chorus girl, much to her mother's disapproval. Pearl indulges in abusing the liquid morphine provided to her father to manage his pain.At the cinema, Pearl meets a young projectionist who takes a liking to her. While riding her bicycle home, Pearl stops along a cornfield and begins dancing with a scarecrow, fantasizing about the projectionist, and sits on top of it. She later sneaks out of the house at night and visits the projectionist, who shows her A Free Ride, an illicit stag film he acquired in Europe. He encourages Pearl to pursue her dreams while she is still young, and suggests she seek a career in Europe. Pearl comments that she cannot abandon her family, and that she wishes they were dead.Pearl's younger and wealthier sister-in-law, Mitzy, tells her of an audition being held to acquire new dancers for a traveling troupe, which Pearl envisions as a way out of her circumstance. When her mother finds a pamphlet Pearl took from the cinema, she confronts her at dinner. The two get into a fierce argument, during which Pearl's mother chastises her for only focusing on her wants and aspirations, before cruelly telling Pearl that she considers her a ""failure"", and that she has seen a malevolence in Pearl that terrifies her. A physical altercation erupts, during which Pearl shoves her mother against the kitchen hearth, igniting her dress and resulting in her mother suffering life-threatening burns. Pearl looks in shock at her mother's dress burning and quickly douses the flames, which leaves her mother unconscious. Pearl drags her mother, still alive, into the basement, and leaves her father seated in the kitchen. She flees to the cinema, where she has sex with the projectionist.In the morning, the projectionist drives Pearl back to the farm so she can prepare for the audition. He becomes unnerved when he notices a maggot-infested roasted pig on the porch, which Mitzy's mother left for them the day prior. He is further perturbed by inconsistencies Pearl has told him. When he attempts to leave, Pearl flies into a fit of rage, feeling she is again being abandoned. As he tries to drive away, she stabs him to death with a pitchfork before pushing his car-with his corpse in it-into a pond, where an alligator she has nicknamed Theda eats his remains. Pearl checks on her mother, who lay semi-conscious on the basement stairs and appears to either die or pass out a few seconds later, and chides her before kicking her down the staircase. Pearl dresses herself in one of her mother's lavish gowns, and bathes and dresses her father in a suit before smothering him to death, justifying it as a mercy killing.Pearl arrives at the church where the audition is being held, and is met by a nervous Mitzy, who insists she go before her. Pearl gives a dance performance she feels will win the talent scouts over, but is profoundly distraught when they deny her for being ""not blonde"" or what they're looking for. Mitzy accompanies Pearl home and attempts to calm her. In the kitchen, Pearl makes a lengthy confession to Mitzy about her resentment toward Howard, who came to work at her family home as a farmhand; Pearl saw her marriage to Howard, the son of an upper-class family, as a way to escape her parents, but was crestfallen when he insisted the two remain on her family's farm. She further confesses her feelings of alienation and insecurity, and admits to having begun murdering farm animals before taking the lives of her parents and the projectionist, which she regrets especially in the case of her father. She finishes by saying that she really loves Howard, that being loved is all she really wants and that she'll try to make the farm a home if that's what he wants. A stunned Mitzy attempts to leave, nervously assuring Pearl she will not divulge their conversation. Pearl calmly pushes Mitzy to confess that she was chosen for the troupe by the talent scouts, then quietly watches her leave. A few seconds later, she slowly follows Mitzy onto the porch and grabs an axe. Mitzy attempts to flee. Pearl chases her down the driveway and brutally kills her with an axe.Pearl dismembers Mitzy's body and feeds her corpse to Theda, before going into the basement and lying with her dead mother, whom she tells she loves. Having reached the conclusion that her mother is correct, and that Pearl should ""make the best of what she has"", Pearl decides to remediate her wrongdoings by creating a comfortable home for Howard when he returns from combat. The next morning, Howard arrives unexpectedly. In the kitchen, he is horrified to find the dead bodies of Pearl's parents seated at the dining table around the rotting pig. Pearl greets him with a protracted, pained expression of joy."

An original epic set in 1920s Los Angeles led by Brad Pitt, Margot Robbie and Diego Calva, with an ensemble cast including Jovan Adepo, Li Jun Li and Jean Smart. A tale of outsized ambition and outrageous excess, it traces the rise and fall of multiple characters during an era of unbridled decadence and depravity in early Hollywood. Hollywood, 1926. Nellie LaRoy is trying to catch her first break as an actress. Manny Torres wants to do something in movies, anything as he believes filmmaking is the ultimate profession. Sidney Palmer is an unambitious young trumpeter whose happy to go wherever the music takes him. Jack Conrad is Hollywood's #1 leading man. Their lives and careers are about to be intertwined in maelstrom of ambition, breakthroughs, disappointments, changing technology and audiences and decadence.—grantss Bel Air, California, 1926. Wearing practically nothing, Nellie LaRoy, a streetwise nobody and brassy wannabe starlet, crashes an orgiastic, sex-and-drug-fuelled Hollywood party looking for her big break and a chance to shine. At the same time, starry-eyed Mexican kid Manny Torres is eager to do anything for a job on a movie set--the most magical place in the world. Then, there's Sidney Palmer, a brilliant up-and-coming African-American jazz trumpeter, and the captivating cabaret singer Lady Fay Zhu--both tiny cogs in the well-oiled movie industry. But they don't know it yet. And as Nellie becomes an overnight sensation and Manny crosses paths with silver-screen heartthrob Jack Conrad, the biggest A-lister of the silent era, the trio is about to discover how expendable stars can be. Because, cruel as it may sound, the allure of Tinseltown is irresistible and inescapable. Then again, so are the snares of Babylon.—Nick Riganas In 1926 Bel-Air, Los Angeles, Mexican immigrant Manuel ""Manny"" Torres (Diego Calva) helps transport an elephant to a debauched bacchanal, rife with sex, jazz, and cocaine, at Kinoscope Studios executive Don Wallach's (Jeff Garlin) mansion. He quickly becomes smitten with Nellie LaRoy (Margot Robbie), a brash, ambitious self-declared ""star"" from New Jersey. Upon meeting, Manny reveals his wish to be part of something bigger. While the elephant walks through, distracting party-goers, Manny helps carry away young actress Jane Thornton (Phoebe Tonkin), who overdosed on drugs with Urolagniac actor Orville Pickwick (Troy Metcalf).
Jack Conrad is the biggest movie star of the period. Producer George Munn is his best friend.Also attending are Chinese-American lesbian cabaret-singer Lady Fay Zhu (Li Jun Li) and African-American jazz trumpeter Sidney Palmer (Jovan Adepo). The flamboyantly-dancing Nellie is spotted and swiftly recruited to replace Jane in a Kinoscope film.
Manny meets and befriends Jack Conrad (Brad Pitt), a benevolent but troubled, oft-married film star, and drives the drunken Jack home.
Nellie reaches the Kinoscope studio in the middle of the desert, where several low budget films are being shot at the same time. Nellie and Sidney are shown to be living in literal dumps back in their real life. Movies are their only escape from their depressing reality.
During filming, Nellie crudely upstages Constance Moore (Samara Weaving). The director of the movie Ruth (Olivia Hamilton) and doesn't take Nellie seriously as she is flatter chested than what she needed for her scene. Nellie is taken to make-up and barely given any instructions, before she is asked to start dancing on the sets. The set is out of glycerin for a crying scene and Neville demonstrates her acting chops by crying on cue. Soon, Ruth starts directing Neville, and ignores the regular actress Moore.Jack helps Manny secure assistant jobs at Kinoscope (like finding Otto Von Strassberger (Spike Jonze) a new camera to film Jack in an outdoors love scene before nightfall). All 10 cameras were damaged during the shooting for a war scene and the sun sets in 3 hours. Manny is chosen to drive to the city and return in 3 hours. Manny drives like a maniac and gets the camera but is stuck in a traffic jam on his way back. He steals an ambulance to clear the traffic and gets back in time with a camera.
Manny climbs the studio system's ranks. He is soon the master of getting things done, including getting the extras to stop their strike, and getting dead bodies off the set (one extra died during the shooting of a movie).
At the end of the day's chaotic shooting, the perfect scenes with Nellie and Jack are in the can. Fay and Wallace notice Neville. The shooting is followed by a wild party night.Nellie quickly becomes an ""it girl"" covered by gossip columnist Elinor St John (Jean Smart), who also follows Jack's career. Nellie even gets plastic surgery done to enhance her looks. Nellie is a Bonafide star now.
As sound film displaces silents in the late-1920s, Manny skillfully adapts to technical changes, eventually becoming a director.
The sets are hot as the ACs are too loud. Everyone has to wear rubber soles. The whole set is made soundproof. This is the new way of making films.
Nellie struggles to navigate sound film's demands as she is either too loud or she mumbles. One cameraman dies filming her due to the suffocating heat. Nellie increases her drug use and reckless gambling, tarnishing her reputation despite Manny's assistance.Nellie overhears at her party that Wallace is considering dumping her from the movie as the movie is over budget as Nellie can never find the mark on her scenes.
Nellie, shown to have an institutionalized mother, eggs on her drunken father (and inept business-manager) Robert (Eric Roberts) to publicly fight a rattlesnake during a party; he passes out. Nellie carves the spotlight and decides that she will fight the snake, which bites her neck; Fay kills it and sucks out the venom. Nellie passionately kisses her.By 1932, Jack begins to sense that his popularity has waned, but still works in low-budget Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer films, owned by Irving Thalberg (Max Minghella). As Hollywood becomes less libertine, executives tell Manny to fire Fay, a Kinoscope title writer, because of her perceived lesbian affair with Nellie.
While practicing lines with new wife Estelle (Katherine Waterston), Jack is devastated to learn his longtime friend/producer, George Munn (Lukas Haas), has committed suicide. Estelle was trying to convert Jack into a Broadway actor, but Jack loses his temper after Munn's death and tells Estelle that only rich geriatrics care about Broadway in LA. People want entertainment and he knows how to deliver it.
Sidney has secured his own musical film and orchestra. Sidney moves into a brand-new mansion and the rich life.Elinor and Manny attempt to revamp Nellie's image and ingratiate her into Hollywood's high society, but at a party with William Randolph Hearst (Pat Skipper) and Marion Davies (Chloe Fineman), Nellie lashes out against upper-class snobbery, vomiting on Hearst.
Jack finds Elinor's cover story about his declining popularity and confronts her; she explains that although his star has faded, he will be immortalized on film. Jack tries to get in touch with Irving, but he refuses to meet Jack.
Irving eventually returns Jack's calls and offers him a movie. But Jack makes Irving admit that the movie is not very good, his first-choice actor bailed, and hence Jack is the back-up.
Sidney is offended when studio executives convince Manny to request, that Sidney don black-face for Southern audiences. Sidney was performing as part of a band, but he looked light skinned next to the other band members. So, Manny was asked to convince Sidney to don the black-face. Manny tells Sidney that if he doesn't comply, the movie will not get made and the band will not be paid anything.
Upon completion, Sidney leaves Kinoscope. Jack encounters Fay at a hotel party; she reveals her departure for Europe and Pathé.
Afterwards, in his hotel room, a despondent Jack fatally shoots himself.Eccentric gangster James McKay (Tobey Maguire) threatens Nellie's life over her massive gambling debts amounting to $85,000. Manny initially rejects her pleas for help, but later secures funds from the movie-set drug-pusher/aspiring actor ""The Count"" (Rory Scovel), and visits James with him to pay off Nellie's debt.
Manny panics upon learning the money is counterfeit, made by his own prop-maker. James invites the men to a subterranean gathering-space for animal-abusing debauched parties, raving about potential film ideas. When James realizes the cash is counterfeit, he attempts to kill them, but they narrowly escape, killing James' henchman Wilson (Ethan Suplee).Manny asks Nellie to flee with him to Mexico, marry, and start a new life. She resists, but eventually agrees. James' associate tracks Manny down, killing The Count and his roommate but sparing Manny's life if Manny leaves Los Angeles. Nellie reneges on her decision and dances away into the night. A montage of newspaper clippings reveals Elinor's death at age 76, and Nellie's death from a drug overdose at 34.In 1952, Manny returns to California with his wife Silvia (Karen Bethzabe) and young daughter, having fled to New York City and established a radio shop. He shows them the Kinoscope Studios entrance but visits a nearby cinema alone to see Singin' in the Rain, whose depiction of the industry's transition from silents to talkies moves him to tears. A century-spanning series of vignettes from films follows. As the focus returns to Singin' in the Rain, Manny tearfully smiles."

The other guests attending the dinner are Lillian, a food critic; her editor Ted; wealthy couple Richard and Anne; George, a post-prime movie star, and his personal assistant Felicity; and business partners Soren, Dave, and Bryce, along with Julian's alcoholic mother. The group is given a tour of the island by the restaurant Maître d'hôtel, Elsa, who notes that Margot was not Tyler's designated guest for the evening.Dinner begins, and Julian introduces a series of courses, delivering increasingly unsettling monologues about each meal. As the night goes on, secrets about each guest, ranging from affairs to money laundering, are slowly revealed amidst dialogue satirizing class divides, climate change, patriarchy hindering women's success (and creating unreasonable expectations for men), and capitalistic exploitation, usually spurred by Julian and the staff's introductions and meals. During the fourth course, a sous chef kills himself in front of the guests, and another staff member cuts off Richard's ring finger when he tries to escape. After the fourth course, the restaurant's prime investor, and Soren, Dave and Bryce's boss, is drowned in full view of the diners. At various points in the night, Julian allows guests to attempt escape, only to have the staff catch and return them.Julian declares all the guests were selected because they either contributed to him losing his passion for his craft or because they make a living off exploiting the work of artisans and workers like him and his team. He announces that everyone present will be dead by the end of the night. Since Margot's presence was unplanned, Julian privately gives her the choice of dying either with the staff or with the guests. When Margot hesitates, Julian decides for her, saying he knows his upper-crust customers from fellow service-industry workers.It is revealed that Margot is an escort named Erin, who has been hired before by Richard (explaining them staring at each other all night), and who Tyler has hired for the evening. Julian reveals that Tyler was invited personally and knew all along that the dinner would end with everyone's death, so he invited Margot knowing full well she would die. Julian humiliates Tyler further by forcing him to cook and insulting his food, causing Tyler to kill himself in a storeroom. Julian asks Margot to collect a barrel needed for dessert.Margot sneaks into Julian's house, only to be attacked by Elsa. Margot kills Elsa in self-defense by stabbing her in the neck. After seeing newspaper clippings of Julian's past life in his office, Margot finds a radio, calls for help and returns to the restaurant with the barrel. A Coast Guard officer arrives from his boat, then reveals himself to be a line cook in disguise and returns to the kitchen.Margot mocks Julian's dishes and complains that she is still hungry. When Julian asks what she would like to eat, Margot requests a cheeseburger and fries, having previously seen a photo of a younger, happier Julian working at a fast-food restaurant. Moved by her simple request, he prepares the meal to her specifications. Margot takes a bite and praises his food, then asks if she can get it ""to go"". Julian packs the food for her, and he and the staff allow her to leave. Margot takes the Coast Guard boat docked nearby and escapes the island.The dessert is an elevated s'mores dish - the staff cover the floor with crushed graham crackers and adorn the guests with small capes made of marshmallows and hats made of chocolate. Julian then sets the restaurant ablaze, detonating the barrel and killing the guests, staff, and himself as Margot watches from the boat and unpacks her cheeseburger to-go."

During a conversation, Burt laments that maybe he should have helped steer Sam down a more stable career path earlier in life, but reluctantly accepts his son's passion for filmmaking.Sam has also been sending out letters to film and TV studios, and eventually gets a response from a network executive at CBS, who may be able to get Sam an assistant role on the show, ""Hogan's Heroes.""Noting Sam's passion for filmmaking, the executive takes Sam to the office across from his, where Sam is shocked to find himself in the presence of western director, John Ford (David Lynch).The grizzled director shares a few filmmaking tips with Sam, and the young man exits the building with a smile, and a spring in his step."

Although Rose diagnoses her as having hallucinations, Laura insists that the entity has the power to appear as other people wearing an eerie smile. Claiming she is about to die, Laura suddenly freaks out, then begins smiling ominously before cutting open her neck with a broken vase shard in front of Rose.One of the detectives who interviews Rose about Laura's death turns out to be her ex-boyfriend Joel. Still shaken by what she saw, Rose recounts what Laura told her about supposedly being cursed by an evil presence with a haunting smile.Rose begins seeing Laura smiling at her in various places.

During the drive, Rose tells a disbelieving Joel that she thinks the entity possesses people before they kill themselves and she worries her time with the curse is almost up.At the jail, Robert privately reveals to Rose that the only way to break the curse's chain is to kill someone else, but there has to be a witness because the entity needs trauma to continue surviving. Robert suddenly panics when he realizes Rose currently carries the curse.Madeline visits Rose back at home. Rose realizes the presence is impersonating Madeline when the real Madeline calls her on the phone. Madeline's smiling doppelganger threatens Rose.Armed with a kitchen knife, Rose drives to the hospital.

When the Nazis steal his gold, they quickly discover that they have just tangled with no ordinary miner. While there is no direct translation for the Finnish word ""sisu"", this legendary ex-commando will embody what sisu means: a white-knuckled form of courage and unimaginable determination in the face of overwhelming odds. And no matter what the Nazis throw at him, the one-man death squad will go to outrageous lengths to get his gold back - even if it means killing every last Nazi in his path.

And now, of all times, fortune smiles upon the solitary gold panner. Unfortunately, as the precious discovery attracts unwanted attention, Korpi soon finds himself up against an armed-to-the-teeth Wehrmacht platoon bent on snatching his priceless shiny nuggets. But no one steals from Aatami--not even crazed, gun-toting Nazis desperate for a way out.—Nick Riganas In late 1944, the Finns make a treaty with the Soviet Union, that aggression between them will cease if they will remove their former German allies from Finland. This conflict is known as the Lapland War, and the German forces retaliate against the Finns. Retired commando and prospector Aatami Korpi lives alone with only his horse and his faithful dog in the remote wilderness of Lapland. Aatami spends his days panning and mining in search of gold. He sees battles taking place in the distance, but takes little interest in them. After uncovering a rich gold deposit, he collects a hefty amount of nuggets and mounts his horse, heading for the nearest town with his dog in tow. Along the way, Aatami encounters a 30-man Wehrmacht platoon led by ruthless SS Obersturmführer Bruno Helldorf and his subordinate Wolf, who are destroying settlements in their retreat and have taken several Finnish women captive. Helldorf takes little interest in Aatami, letting him pass. Aatami is soon accosted by a second group of soldiers who discover his saddlebags full of gold and prepare to execute him and his dog, but he swiftly kills them all. Alerted by the gunfire, Bruno investigates and discovers the carnage. He finds one of Aatami's gold nuggets, taken by one of the dying soldiers. Bruno and his tank pursue Aatami to the edge of a minefield, where Aatami's horse is killed by a landmine. Gathering up his gold, Aatami intentionally detonates another mine to make his escape. The soldiers sent after him are quickly claimed by the minefield. Two of the captive women are ordered ahead to ensure a clear path. One of the captives, Aino, volunteers to take the place of one of the women and leads the way. Retrieving Aatami's dog tag, Bruno learns that he was once a Finnish commando who lost his family and home fighting against the Red Army during the Winter War. Left with nothing, the vengeful Aatami became a legendary ""one-man death squad"" nicknamed Koschei, the ""Immortal"", who has killed hundreds of Communist troops. Bruno ignores the warning, defying orders to turn around and cease following Aatami. Wounded and exhausted, Aatami is awakened by the platoon's approach. With the soldiers' dogs on his trail, he hangs underneath one of the German vehicles and punctures the fuel tank, dousing himself in gasoline to hide his scent. When the platoon halts to inspect the leak, Aatami flees, holding the dogs at bay by lighting himself on fire before diving into a nearby lake. Waiting for him to surface, Bruno sends soldiers into the lake, but Aatami slits their throats underwater and breathes in the escaping air from their necks. Aatami reaches the other side of the lake, but Bruno finds his dog. Aatami discovers the town has been left in burning ruins by the Germans, and takes shelter in a petrol station. Bruno sends Aatami's dog to find his master, with a lit dynamite stick attached to his collar. Aatami saves the dog but is subdued by the explosion. Bruno, Wolf, and tank driver Schütze hang Aatami from the petrol station's sign, taking the gold and leaving him for dead, but Aatami hooks his wounds onto a protruding reinforcement bar, saving him from the noose but rendering him unconscious and still hanging from the rope. A pair of German pilots land in search of fuel and the wind from the plane loosens the petrol station's sign and cause Aatami to fall to the ground. The engineer in the plane notices Aatami is alive and the pilot orders him to kill Aatami and the dog. Aatami manages to kill the engineer and knocks the pilot unconscious. Unwilling to face the consequences of Germany's impending defeat, Bruno intends to use the gold to escape with Wolf and Schütze, arranging for a pilot to fly them to safety while the rest of the platoon makes their way to Norway. Meanwhile, Aatami forces the surviving pilot to fly him towards the platoon. Soon, the soldiers discover the airplane crashed in their path, with the pilot hanged by the same noose Wolf used on Aatami. As the convoy continues, Aatami climbs onto the truck holding the captured women, kills their guards, and arms the women. He and Aino commandeer one of the trucks, allowing him to leap onto Bruno's tank while the women gun down the rest of the soldiers in the other truck. Pulling Wolf out of the tank and beating him badly, Aatami leaves him at the mercy of the women and follows Bruno, who callously kills Schütze before taking off with the pilot. Aatami fires on the plane, mortally wounding the pilot, and uses his pickax to hack his way on-board in midair. After engaging in hand-to-hand combat, Bruno beats Aatami with a static line, subduing him. As Bruno is about to hit him again, Aatami swiftly hooks the static line to a bomb and releases the bomb through the bomb-bay door, dropping Bruno to his death. Finding the pilot also dead, Aatami straps himself in as the plane crashes into a large swamp. Led by Aino, the women deliver Wolf and the German tank to an incredulous Finnish unit. Remarkably still alive, Aatami crawls out of the swamp, reunites with his dog, and makes his way to war-ravaged Helsinki. Bloody and battered, Aatami enters a bank where he dumps his gold nuggets on the counter. The other customers are smartly dressed and look at him in wonderment. He finally speaks for the first time in the movie, asking the teller to exchange them for large bank notes, explaining they will not be as heavy to carry as the nuggets have been."
Bodies Bodies Bodies,2022,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8110652/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"When a group of rich 20-somethings plan a hurricane party at a remote family mansion, a party game turns deadly in this fresh and funny look at backstabbing, fake friends, and one party gone very, very wrong. Nervous about meeting the smug, wealthy friends of her rehabilitated girlfriend Sophie, timid newcomer Bee arrives late to a booze-addled, drug-fuelled hurricane party at bored David's Georgian grey-stone manor house. As the storm rages outside, the party gets started, and the group of spoiled zoomers gathers around the host in the family mansion's luxurious drawing room to play a compelling, find-the-killer murder mystery game with the lights off. But it's all fun and games until someone loses an eye. And when one of the players ends up dead, mass hysteria takes over, and the petty, narcissistic backstabbers start to turn on each other. Now, cut off from the outside world, their lives depend on figuring out who's behind the frantic outburst of senseless, bloody violence. However, as bitter rivalries flare up and old wounds reopen, how can David's self-absorbed guests survive the night?—Nick Riganas Bee, a working-class young woman from Eastern Europe, travels with her wealthy girlfriend Sophie to a ""hurricane party"" at a mansion owned by the family of David, Sophie's friend. Other guests include David's actress girlfriend Emma, the podcaster Alice, her much-older new boyfriend Greg, and the enigmatic Jordan. Max, another guest, left after a fight with David the night before Sophie and Bee arrived.After drinking, using drugs, and dancing, the group decides to play ""Bodies Bodies Bodies"", a murder in the dark-style game. Greg goes to bed early due to hostility throughout the game from David, who also leaves soon after another fight with Emma. As the storm worsens, the power goes out and the girls scramble to find a power source. Minutes later, Bee finds David outside with his throat slashed, a blood-stained kukri nearby. Panicked and without reception, the group try to go for help in Sophie's car, but find its battery dead.The group discovers Greg has a go bag with a knife and a map of the area and become suspicious of him. They fearfully confront Greg, who returns their hostility. After a struggle, Bee bludgeons him to death with a kettle bell in self-defense.The group doubt that Greg was the killer and Emma theorizes that Max, who had confessed feelings for her the night before, returned to kill David. Sophie, a sober addict, relapses. Emma kisses her, to Sophie's confusion, before accepting drugs. Alice later finds Emma dead from a head wound at the bottom of the stairs, and believes the group is being killed one by one.

She sees Jordan holding David's father's gun through a window, then crawls back inside through a pet door. Bee confronts the group, revealing that she dropped out of college to take care of her mother, who has borderline personality disorder. A vicious verbal fight ensues between the group. Jordan, who was the ""killer"" in the Bodies Bodies Bodies game, reveals resentment for Sophie due to her drug addiction and using David to regain access to her trust fund, and claims Sophie cheated on Bee with her, which Sophie denies.

When someone turns up dead, Detective Benoit Blanc is put on the case. Five long-time friends are invited to the Greek island home of billionaire Miles Bron. All five know Bron from way back and owe their current wealth, fame, and careers to him. The main event is a murder-weekend game with Bron to be the victim. In reality, they all have reasons to kill him. Also invited is Benoit Blanc, the world's greatest detective.—grantss Having planned out an elaborate murder-mystery game down to the last detail, visionary New York City tech billionaire Miles Bron invites his close friends to his private slice of paradise in the Aegean for the weekend. As a mysterious invitation jolts debonair investigator Benoit Blanc into action, the inquisitive master detective sets foot on the sun-kissed Greek isle to rub shoulders with the reclusive host's back-stabbing supporters--because, just like inKnives Out (2019), each has a skeleton in the closet. But in Blanc's eyes, the solution is in plain sight. The question is, can he find the crucial last piece of information before warm, bright-red blood stains Bron's idyllic sanctuary?—Nick Riganas During the COVID-19 pandemic in May 2020, Miles Bron, the billionaire co-founder of the technology company Alpha, decides to host a murder mystery game at his mansion, the Glass Onion, on his private island in Greece. He invites five friends: Alpha head scientist Lionel Toussaint, Connecticut governor Claire Debella, controversial fashion designer Birdie Jay, men's rights streamer Duke Cody, and Alpha cofounder and ousted ex-CEO Cassandra ""Andi"" Brand. Famous detective Benoit Blanc also receives an invitation and joins the group, along with Birdie's assistant Peg and Duke's girlfriend Whiskey. Also present on the island is Miles' friend Derol, who is only staying because he is ""going through some things"" and is not part of the party.Miles questions the presence of Blanc - not invited by him - but allows him to stay, assuming that another guest invited him as a joke. Blanc overhears Peg confront Miles over a PR statement he wants Birdie to release, and sees Duke watch Whiskey in bed with Miles. Before dinner, Miles shows off the Mona Lisa, which he has on loan from the Louvre, and reveals that the Glass Onion is powered by ""Klear"", a hydrogen-based alternative fuel that Alpha will launch in a week, despite Lionel's and Claire's safety concerns.Blanc solves Miles' pretend murder mystery immediately, and tensions over Andi's presence culminate in her leaving the main party room. Suddenly, Duke collapses and dies after drinking from Miles' glass; the panicking group suspects Andi. After the group discovers that Duke's pistol is missing, the power goes out and everyone splits up in the chaos. Blanc finds Andi, but an unseen assailant shoots her. Blanc gathers the rest of the group and announces that he has solved Andi's murder.An extended flashback shows that Andi actually died, supposedly by suicide, a week before the trip, and her twin sister Helen hired Blanc to investigate her death. At Alpha, Andi had halted development of Klear due to safety concerns, and so Miles had her removed as CEO; this maneuver was supported by their friends perjuring themselves by testifying that he had single-handedly sketched out the plan for Alpha years ago on a napkin. However, Andi rediscovered the original napkin where she had written out the idea, and emailed a photo of the evidence to the group. Helen suspects that someone in the group killed Andi to avoid being discredited and to gain favor with Miles. With the news of Andi's death not yet public, Blanc proposed that Helen pose as Andi at Miles' party, helping him investigate.Helen helps Blanc discover motives for each member of the group to protect Miles from Andi: Lionel and Claire have already staked their reputations on Klear, Miles is financially rescuing Birdie from the fallout of employing child labor, and Duke is using Whiskey to seduce Miles in exchange for a role at Alpha News. Helen also discovers that all four other guests visited Andi's home on the day of her death. Helen disrupts the party so she can search the guest rooms for Andi's napkin. When she is shot, Andi's journal in her jacket pocket stops the bullet, but Blanc tells the other guests she was killed, creating an opportunity for her to finish the search in Miles' office.Blanc reveals his deduction that Miles was responsible for both murders. Miles killed Andi after learning she had the napkin, but Duke saw Miles' car leaving her house. When news of Andi's death was finally released online during the party, Duke realized that Miles was responsible and attempted to blackmail him in order to get on Alpha News. This prompted Miles to poison him, exploiting his allergy to pineapple, and to snatch Duke's pistol, with which he would shoot Helen. Helen locates Andi's original napkin in Miles' office, and her true identity (and survival) is revealed to the group. However, Miles burns the napkin, eliminating the evidence against him.In cathartic anger, Helen destroys Miles' glass sculptures with Miles' friends joining in. Helen lights a bonfire and throws Klear into it, causing an explosion that destroys the Glass Onion. As Blanc and Derol watch on from the beach, Helen exposes the Mona Lisa to the fire, destroying it. Realizing the painting's destruction will reveal that Klear is dangerous, ruining Miles, the group decides to testify against him for his crimes. At the beach, Helen and Blanc watch the police boats arrive."

And with no one to turn to, the two unsuspecting children seek solace in the living room. After all, watching cartoons and playing with toys never harmed anyone. But innocence attracts evil. Then, as long, numbing spells of silence pierce the subconscious, an eerie, blood-curdling voice from beyond invites the lost kids into the ill-lit basement. Because in this house, chaos reigns. What's the point of trying to escape when there is no door?—Nick Riganas Kevin, a four year old boy, is playing on the stairs of his home in the mid 1990's. Suddenly, he is shoved down the stairs for an unknown reason. He is noticeably injured, but his father is relived that he does not need stitches. His father assumes he fell.An unknown amount of time later, but suggested that maybe later that night or the next, Kevin wakes up in the middle of the night by a loud noise. He wakes up his sister, Kaylee, a similarly aged young girl. They turn on the lights of their respective upstairs bedrooms and walk into the hallway to investigate. After a few moments of investigating the upstairs floor, they call out for their father, who does not respond. They shrug off this issue, assuming their father will be back soon.Excited by the prospect of their father not being home, Kaylee suggests sleeping downstairs in the living room. Downstairs, they set up their bedspreads on the couches of the living room and build a Lego village on the floor in front of the TV. They TV plays old VHS cartoons, especially properties such as Betty Boop and Disney-like animation accompanied by classic cartoon soundtracks, which play throughout the entire film.

They discover that night lights have been unplugged, phone lines have been disconnected, and all the windows and doors of the home have disappeared.Later that night Kaylee asks Kevin where their parents could be, however Kevin is noticeably uncomfortable by the mention of their mother, and asks that Kaylee does not bring her up again. Later they continue playing with Lego's and hear a sudden loud noise coming from the adjoining dining room. Now possessing a flashlight, they investigate to find a chair now standing upside down on the ceiling. They are clearly disturbed, but shrug it off before returning to their leisure in the living room before falling asleep.After waking up, Kaylee calls Kevin into the downstairs bathroom, pointing out that the toilet has now disappeared. They collect two buckets as a remedy, but not before stating how gross this is. Later that day or night (they have completely lost track of time), Kaylee hears a voice coming from the dark hallway next to the living room, which beckons her to go upstairs. She follows, which leads her to her parents' bedroom.

Kevin asks what happened upstairs, but Kaylee does not respond. However, Kaylee insists on moving one of the couches to block entry/exit into the dark adjoining hallway where the voice originated. Later that night, while the two sleep, the cartoon on the TV begins to repeat a scene where a character preforms an illusion where they make themselves disappear. While doing so, the stuffed dolls of both children begin to disappear.The next day/night the voice returns, asking that both children go downstairs to the basement. Kevin, still adorning the flashlight lead his sister into the basement. Soon after, the flashlight loses power. The two young children immediately start to lose composure and get lost in the darkness. Kevin calls out to Kaylee, with no answer. Suddenly the flashlight regains power, only to immediately shine on Kaylee's face, which has now lost both their eyes and mouth and are instead covered by skin.Kevin is now alone in the living room. While he tries to survive, more and more items begin to shift towards the ceiling and other walls in the house. Kevin does not seem to care. The voice comes from the hallway again, but this time commanding that Kevin retrieves a knife from the kitchen, and stab his eye out. The camera then cuts to different rooms around the house while a child's scream erupts, seemingly no less terrifying and loud depending on the room or floor.Now in horrible, severe pain, Kevin attempts to use the phone again, and is surprised to see that it works. He calls 911, where an operator on the other line asks questions about his location and condition, and that Kevin stays on the line until other ""grown ups"" can come and help. Kevin responds, saying that he ""is cut and feeling sick"". The operator asks for his location, where Kevin responds that ""The doors are gone"" before dropping the home phone on the floor and leaving the room.Later, Kevin calls out to the voice, asking what happened to Kaylee. The voice responds, saying that Kaylee did not do as she was told therefore, her mouth was ""removed"". Soon after, the voice whispers that Kevin needs to come upstairs. He obeys, and soon starts to lose power with his flashlight. To remedy this situation, he turns the flashlight on and off sporadically to save battery. After multiple instances of turning the flashlight on and off, he finds himself standing on the ceiling of the second floor of the house. He calls out for Kaylee and his mother, before being pulled around a corner by an unknown being. From the corner, blood sprays and pours out while Kevin calls out for his ""mommy"". The shot plays then reverses again multiple times. A door is shown in the pitch darkness, but does not open.Later, Kevin's toy radio is seen suspended and sitting upright of the upstairs hallway ceiling, defying gravity. This is surrounded by his other Lego's and bulling toys. The radio plays the cartoon theme music from earlier. It is revealed that it has been roughly a year and a half since the previous events. The camera fades out, showing that the hallway its infinite and continues until the radio and Lego stack are out of sight.Kevin, who is revealed to have survive the previous events, has gained control of his flashlight again. In the darkness, he makes out a face that stares at him with an absent expression. He calls out to it, asking for its name, to no response. He asks again, but the figure does not respond instead electing to stare at him in the darkness.THE END."

Stymied by the cadets' code of silence, he enlists one of their own to help unravel the case - a young man the world would come to know as Edgar Allan Poe. At West Point Academy in 1830, the calm of an October evening is shattered by the discovery of a young cadet's body swinging from a rope just off the parade grounds.

Someone has stolen into the room where the body lay and removed the heart. West Point Academy, 1830. With the lifeless body of a troubled trainee found hanging from a tree branch, grief-stricken former New York constable Augustus Landor arrives at the wintry military post.

But faced with the students' impenetrable silence and blood-chilling evidence of corpse desecration, the grizzled investigator will need all the help he can get to shed light on the mysterious death. Does mournful CadetEdgar Allan Poeknow more than he lets on?—Nick Riganas In October 1830, alcoholic retired detective Augustus Landor is asked by the military to investigate the hanging of Cadet Leroy Fry at the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York. Landor is a widower who lives alone since his daughter Mattie ran off a few years previously.After Fry was hanged, his heart was removed from his body. In the morgue, examining the corpse, Landor finds a small fragment of a note clutched tightly in Fry's hand. Also, marks on Fry's neck and fingers suggest that he did not hang himself, but was murdered.Landor secretly enlists the help of Edgar Allan Poe, another cadet at the academy, who has expressed an interest in the case. Poe and Landor deduce from the writing on the note fragment that it was summoning Fry to a secret meeting. After a cow and a sheep are found in the area, butchered and with their hearts removed, it is deduced that the murder could be linked to black magic rituals.Another cadet, Ballinger, goes missing and is later found hanged, with both his heart and his genitals removed. A third cadet, Stoddard, who was a colleague of the two victims, then disappears, and it is presumed by Landor that this man had reason to believe he was next in line to be killed.Landor and Poe begin to suspect the family of Dr. Daniel Marquis, who was first brought into the investigation to perform the autopsy on Fry. Particular suspicion is placed on his son Artemus and his daughter Lea (who suffers from random seizures). While visiting Dr. Marquis's house, Landor finds an old officer's uniform; a man impersonating an officer had been involved in the mutilation of Fry's body. Landor confronts Dr. Marquis, who admits that he had resorted to black magic to cure Lea of her seizures, and initially she appeared to improve.Poe is enchanted by Lea and volunteers to do whatever she wants. However, he is drugged and wakes to find that Artemus and Lea are about to cut out his heart, in accordance with the ritual to cure Lea. Landor manages to arrive in time to rescue Poe, but the building catches fire and Lea and Artemus die.Thinking that the case is now solved, the military thanks Landor for his service. However, after recovering from his near-death experience, Poe confronts Landor with his realization that the handwriting on the note fragment found in Fry's hand matches that of Landor. Threading together all the information that he has gathered, it becomes apparent that Landor was in fact the killer of the cadets.Two years previously, Landor's daughter Mattie was raped by Fry, Ballinger, and Stoddard after attending her first ball. Traumatized by the experience, she later killed herself by jumping off a cliff. Landor did not disclose this to anyone, but pretended that she had run away.Distraught, Landor set out to avenge his daughter. He left the note for Fry, luring him to a lonely spot before hanging him. However, a patrol happened to walk by, so Landor was forced to leave the body there. Lea and Artemus later stole the heart for their ritual. After killing Ballinger, Landor mutilated his corpse to make it appear that the cadet had been murdered by the same ""madman"" who had desecrated Fry's body.Poe tells Landor he has two notes with handwriting samples that can link Landor directly to the murders, but before leaving, Poe burns them. Landor is later seen standing at the cliff where his daughter leap to her death. He lets her hair ribbon float away in the wind, saying ""Rest, my love""."

Tár,2022,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14444726/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Set in the international world of Western classical music, the film centers on Lydia Tár, widely considered one of the greatest living composer-conductors and the very first female director of a major German orchestra. Having achieved an enviable career few could even dream of, renowned conductor/composer Lydia Tár, the first female principal music director of the Berlin Philharmonic, is at the top of her game. As a conductor, Lydia not only orchestrates, she manipulates. As a trailblazer, the passionate virtuoso leads the way in the male-dominated classical music industry. Lydia prepares for the release of her memoir while juggling work and family. She is also willing to take up one of her most significant challenges: a live recording ofGustav Mahler's Symphony No. 5. However, forces that even the imperious maestro can't control slowly chip away at Lydia's elaborate facade, revealing the genius's dirty secrets and the insidious, corrosive nature of power. What if life knocks Lydia off her pedestal?—Nick Riganas Lydia Tár (Cate Blanchett) is one of the greatest living composer-conductors, and the very first openly gay female chief conductor of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra. In an interview with Adam Gopnik at the New Yorker Festival, she promotes several new projects, including her upcoming live recording of Mahler's 5th Symphony. She relies on Francesca Lentini (Noemie Merlant), her attentive personal assistant, and Sharon Goodnow (Nina Hoss), her sickly wife and concertmaster. Lydia has lunch with Eliot Kaplan (Mark Strong), a conductor who also manages a fellowship program she founded for aspiring women conductors; and talks about replacing her assistant conductor, Sebastian (Allan Corduner), presumably with Francesca, and filling an open cello position in the orchestra.Later, Lydia guest teaches at Juilliard. She ridicules Max (Zethphan Smith-Gneist), a student, for lacking interest in conducting the classical masters due to his identity politics, encouraging students to look past superficial differences to the music underneath. Max subsequently storms out of the classroom.While in New York, Lydia receives Vita Sackville-West's novel ""Challenge,"" sent by Krista Taylor (Sylvia Flote), a former fellowship program member. Dream sequences and email interactions suggest Lydia groomed Krista into a sexually transactional relationship that later fell apart. Lydia blacklists Krista, ruining Krista's chances for a conducting career.Before a blind audition for a new orchestra cellist, Lydia sees one hopeful, the Russian Olga Metkina (Sophia Kauer), in the bathroom. Attracted to Olga, Lydia secures her favors, such as changing her scorecard to ensure a spot in the orchestra, and a soloist position in the companion piece to Mahler's 5th, Edward Elgar's cello concerto. As she intensively prepares for a Mahler's 5th recording, her relationships with Francesca and Sharon become strained, as both recognize her attraction to Olga.Lydia informs Sebastian of his imminent replacement. Incensed, he indicates the orchestra is aware of her favoritism, and that it suggests abusive behavior towards young women. He speculates Francesca will be his replacement, implying an exchange of sexual favors. Unnerved by the accusations, Lydia plans to replace Sebastian with a different candidate.Krista kills herself, leaving a note with serious allegations against Lydia. Lydia instructs Francesca to delete any emails from or about her. Lydia retains a lawyer as Krista's parents plan to sue her. At the same time, Lydia is haunted by screaming women in the distance, nightmares, chronic pain, an increasing sensitivity to sound, and enigmatic scribbles resembling those Krista once made. Her only respites are Olga, as well as her and Sharon's adopted daughter, Petra.While trying to write new compositions, she is continually disturbed and disgusted by her middle-class neighbor who cares for a dying mother. One day, after practicing Olga's solo, Lydia follows Olga home to an abandoned, dilapidated apartment complex. Scared by a dog, Lydia trips and injures herself. She lies to Sharon and her orchestra, claiming the injuries were from an assault. Without telling Lydia, Francesca resigns upon learning she will not be replacing Sebastian.An edited, out-of-context video of Lydia's Juilliard class goes viral, and an article with accusations against her appears in the New York Post. Protesters meet Lydia as she returns to New York to promote her book and attend a deposition for Krista's lawsuit. At the deposition, it is implied that Francesca has shared damning emails with the plaintiff. She takes Olga along, presumably with hopes of sex, but Olga abandons her. Back home, Sharon leaves with Petra, furious with the allegations, but more so at Lydia's lack of communication or seeking her counsel as her spouse.Lydia is removed as conductor. She sneaks into the live recording performance of Mahler's 5th and, as the music begins, rushes onstage and attacks her replacement, Eliot. Advised to lie low by her management agency, she returns to her lower-class childhood home on Staten Island, where it is revealed that her birth name is Linda Tarr. She watches a tape of her mentor Leonard Bernstein's first episode of Young People's Concerts, ""What Does Music Mean"". Her brother comes home and scolds her.Sometime later, Lydia finds work conducting an orchestra in the Philippines. At a massage parlor/brothel, she picks her masseuse from a glass bowl. The escorts are staged and framed like her orchestra. One girl looks up into Lydia's eyes, her position is #5 as in Mahler's No. 5 Symphony, and Lydia rushes outside to vomit. In the final shot, Lydia conducts her new orchestra in the score for the film version of the ""Monster Hunter"" video game in front of an audience of cos-players."

Six then contacts Fitzroy, who is in Baku, to inform him that he thinks Carmichael is a bad guy. Fitzroy says he will do what he can to look into it.Carmichael suspects Six knows the truth about him, so he employs the help of a former CIA agent, Lloyd Hansen (Chris Evans), to get to Six first before his deeds are exposed, even though Brewer is against it because Hansen is a known sociopath. Carmichael calls Hansen, who is in Monaco torturing a man with electric cables. Hansen is more than happy to go after Six.

The fictionalized version of Nick Cage must accept a $1 million offer to attend the birthday of a dangerous super fan Javi Gutierrez. Things take a wildly unexpected turn when Nick Cage is recruited by a CIA operative Vivian and forced to live up to his own legend, channeling his most iconic and beloved on-screen characters in order to save himself and his loved ones.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Unfortunately, Hollywood mega-starNicolas Cage, is with his back to the wall. Drowning in debt after an ugly divorce, Nick is willing to try everything to get his career back on track, including appearing at a one-off, ludicrously well-paid event for Spanish olive-oil magnate and number oneNicolas Cagefan Javi Gutierrez in sunny Mallorca. Instead, undercover CIA agents, an abduction right under everyone's nose, and an unwanted, peril-laden mission spell trouble for everyone involved, dragging Cage into a frantic adventure. And just like the movies, the guns have the final say. Can a lifetime of experience in killer one-liners and exciting climactic endings save the guy fromThe Croods: A New Age (2020)?—Nick Riganas Nicolas Cageis totally preoccupied with his career, his narcissism fueled by insecurity in being constantly pestered by the manifestation of his ego, ""Nicky"", in his failures. Those failures are currently real in no longer getting the film roles he wants, and that obsession negatively affecting his relationships with his ex-wife Olivia but more importantly his sixteen year old daughter Addy. Solely as an excuse to address that professional flailing, he decides to quit acting. But still needing to pay the bills, especially in light of the divorce, he accepts a lucrative private appearance in Mallorca at super-fan Javi Gutierrez's birthday party, Nic unaware that Javi is an aspiring screenwriter who wants him to star in his penned movie. Nic's arrival at Javi's catches the attention of CIA agents Vivian and Martin, who are investigating the politically motivated kidnapping of a young woman named Maria Delgado. This confluence of events places Nic in arguably the greatest acting role of his life, but one that is real life with implications of his life and that of his loved ones at risk. But in the greatest of cinematic traditions, not everything that happens around him is always as it appears on the surface.—Huggo Hollywood actor Nicolas Cage is struggling with his career after being passed over for several major film roles and is constantly pestered and tormented by ""Nicky"" (Nicolas Cage), who appears to him as his younger (and more successful) self (a figment of Cage's imagination, seen as a younger version of himself). His relationship with his ex-wife Olivia (Sharon Horgan) and daughter Addy (Lily Sheen) is also marred by years of emotional neglect. Following an embarrassing and humiliating event (Cage gets drunk, sings a bad song to take out his own frustration at his own failures) at Addy's birthday party and losing a key film role, Cage plans to retire from acting. He decides to accept a vague offer of $1 million from his agent Richard Fink (Neil Patrick Harris) that involves going to Majorca to meet billionaire playboy Javi Gutierrez (Pedro Pascal) and to be the guest of honor at his birthday. Cage is forced to accept the offer as he has alimony and has substantial debts to pay off due to his lavish lifestyle.Upon meeting Javi, Cage is initially annoyed by his neediness and insistence that they create an improvisational movie based on a script he wrote, but is soon inspired by Javi's determination, and the two of them quickly bond over their surprisingly shared love of films such as The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari and Paddington 2 (the latter of which Cage watches for the first time with Javi).
Soon after, Cage is confronted by CIA agents Vivian (Tiffany Haddish) and Martin (Ike Barinholtz). They suspect that Javi, who they claim made his fortune through arms dealing, is behind the kidnapping of Maria (Katrin Vankova), the daughter of a Catalan anti-crime politician, with the hope that he will drop out of an upcoming election. Despite his insistence otherwise, Cage decides to help the CIA with the mission. Although Cage insists that yrs of being an actor has given him an ability to read people and his guts tells him that Javi is not an arms dealer.After successfully rigging the cameras in Javi's compound, Cage attends a party where he announces his collaboration with Javi on a new movie, as an excuse to stay on the compound long enough to find Maria (Martin and Vivian tell Cage that they suspect Javi of having imprisoned Maria on his compound). After a misadventure involving LSD (Cage and Javi trip out and imagine that they both are being watched. They try to ""run away"" from the spies and share a moment when they help each other climb a wall), Cage discovers that Javi keeps a shrine room dedicated to all of his movies, including a wax figure of his character Castor Troy from the film Face/Off, complete with identical golden guns. Cage finds it difficult to betray Javi, but Vivian convinces him to work the kidnapping into their script so that he could potentially reveal where Maria is.Cage explains his new idea to Javi, who believes that Cage is creatively bankrupt, and possibly has issues he needs to work out. Javi brings Olivia and Addy to his villa from Los Angeles; they are frightened and angered over what is happening. Cage tries to make amends with them, but they reject his appeal and accuse him of prioritizing his film career over his family. Javi privately goes to meet with his cousin Lucas (Paco León), who is revealed to be the true arms dealer and the one who kidnapped Maria. Lucas warns him that Cage is working with the CIA and pressures him to kill Cage, or else Lucas will kill Javi. Cage begins to rethink his friendship since Javi flew in his wife and daughter. Meanwhile Lucas plays Cage's recordings to prove to Javi that Cage is working for the CIA. Lucas tells Javi to kill Cage.Cage and Javi have a stand-off with each other, but neither can bring themselves to kill the other. Lucas sends his men after both of them, and they race back to the house to discover that Addy has been kidnapped. Cage takes Javi, Olivia and Javi's assistant Gabriela (Alessandra Mastronardi) to the CIA safe house, only for the house to have been compromised; Martin has been killed, while Vivian sacrifices herself to kill Lucas's men before they can ambush the group. With Javi's help, Cage and Olivia pose as a reclusive criminal couple (The head of a rival crime family in Majorca, who have not been seen for 15 yrs. Lucas has been trying to contact them to form an alliance with them) to get close to Lucas. They manage to locate Addy and Maria but are found out. However, Cage, Addy, Maria and Olivia escape while Javi and Gabriela stay behind to distract Lucas.Cage, Addy, Olivia and Maria race to the American embassy with Lucas still in pursuit. Upon arrival, Lucas holds Cage at gunpoint, but Addy tosses him a knife which Cage uses to kill him-transitioning into the movie that Cage and Javi completed, presumably based on their adventure. Cage is applauded for his new film and congratulates Javi before going home with his family to watch Paddington 2, now with a better relationship."
Women Talking,2022,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt13669038/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Do nothing, stay and fight, or leave. In 2010, the women of an isolated religious community grapple with reconciling a brutal reality with their faith. The women of an isolated religious community grapple with reconciling their reality with their faith. Though the backstory, we see a community of women come together to figure out how they might move forward together to build a better world for themselves and their children. Stay and fight or leave. They will not do nothing.—Official synopsis 2010. Forced to decide whether to forgive, fight, or leave after realising someone has been abusing them at night, the traumatised mothers, wives, daughters, and sisters of a tight-knit Mennonite colony secretly assemble to vote. But with fear, religious belief, misogyny, and the grave repercussions of rebellion getting in the way of a clear decision, the terrified women find themselves left with no alternative. After all, lengthy discussions require time, the most precious commodity of all. And as tempers flare and tensions boil over, like it or not, the sisterhood will have to take action to make themselves heard.—Nick Riganas In a religion-based colony women are being raped at night. The culprits are caught but the elders inform the women that when they return to the colony while on bail they must forgive them. If they don't forgive them they will be excommunicated from the colony and will not receive eternal life. The women want to make a stand against this abuse, inequality and injustice, but what form should it take?—grantss A young woman sleeps alone, in bed. There are visible bruises and wounds on her hips and upper inner thighs-injuries sustained from forced sexual assault. The woman is told that this is the work of ghosts or her wild imagination. This is trend of this colony and this went on for several years.In 2010, the women and girls of an unnamed, isolated Mennonite colony discover that the men have been using livestock tranquilizer to subdue and sexually assault them. The attackers are arrested and imprisoned in a nearby city for their own protective as the women of the colony brutally attacked them.
Most of the men of the colony travel to oversee the bail, leaving the women by themselves for two days to determine how they will proceed. The women were told to forgive the men, or to leave the colony.
They hold a plebiscite to decide whether to stay and do nothing, stay and fight, or leave.The vote is tied between staying and fighting and leaving. Eleven of the colony's women band together at a hayloft to come to a final decision, though Scarface Janz (Frances McDormand), a ""do-nothing"" woman, leaves the meeting after becoming disillusioned with the discussion, taking her hesitant daughter Anna (Kira Guloien) and resistant granddaughter Helena (Shayla Brown) with her. The women have 24 hours to decide. Janz says that if the women do not forgive, they will be excommunicated and they will lose their place in heaven.
August (Ben Whishaw), the colony's schoolteacher and one of two remaining men, joins the women to record the meeting, as none of the women were taught to read or write. The second man is Melvin (August Winter), a transgender man who, after being assaulted, does not speak, except to the young children. Therefore, he is left in charge of watching over them and warning the women of any outside developments.
Melvin was previously a woman named Neitje (Liv McNeil) was assaulted by her own brother. Neitje had a miscarriage during her pregnancy.Salome (Claire Foy), just back from a trip to gather antibiotics for her little daughter who was assaulted, remains adamant about staying and fighting, an opinion shared by Mejal (Michelle McLeod). Salome had to walk a day and a half with her daughter on her back, to the nearest mobile clinic to get the antibiotics.
Ona (Rooney Mara), who is pregnant after being raped, also suggests that they stay and, after winning the fight, create a new set of rules for the colony that would give the women equality. Women would be taught in schools and allowed to explore the outside world. Mariche (Jessie Buckley), Greta's (Sheila McCarthy) daughter and Autje's (Kate Hallett) mother, disagrees, believing that forgiveness is the only viable option.
Ona says that the men of the colony created the circumstances under which the exploitation of women continue for so long. Ona also suggests that the men could be asked to leave, and the women share a collectively laugh at the idea. The men have the power, and they know it.To defuse the conflict, Ona suggests that August create one document stating the pros and cons of leaving, and another document doing the same for staying.
Pro to staying is that the women won't have to find a new home. They would not have to leave their loved ones behind.
Con of staying & fighting is that they will not be forgiven.The meeting is adjourned. During the break, it is revealed that August is from an excommunicated family (as her mother questioned the practices of the family, and encouraged other people to question them as well) but was recently granted permission to return so that he could be a teacher to the boys of the colony. He and Ona were good childhood friends, and he has had romantic feelings for her since.When the women are counted for the 2010 census, they learn that Klaas (Eli Ham), Mariche's abusive husband, will return that evening to collect more bail money. The meeting resumes. Ona and Mejal change their minds in favor of leaving.
Pros of leaving: they will be safe, and they will see the world. There are no cons of leaving, but they would have to leave their brothers and sons behind.
One argument is to allow men to follow the women, but that would mean that all men would come as they cannot survive without the women.
Ona says that they will need livestock to live along the way. And a map to guide themselves, which August agrees to provide.Salome remains insistent upon fighting, angrily confessing that she would rather kill the men than put her daughter in further harm's way. However, she changes her opinion after being reminded by Agata (Judith Ivey), her mother as well as Ona's, of the principles of their faith.
Greta says that leaving will give them the long term perspective to allow them to forgive the men.
The only remaining unconvinced member is Mariche. An argument ensues between her and the rest of the women; it is revealed that she forgave her husband's abuse at Greta's urging. After Greta apologizes, Mariche agrees to leave.Their reasons for leaving are transcribed by August: to ensure the safety of their children, to be steadfast in their faith, and to have freedom of thought. They decide to try to take boys aged fifteen years and younger with them but will not force any boy over age twelve.
Salome disagrees as her boy is over 12 years old. August says that boys of 13 or 14 years of age are capable of inflicting great damage to girls and women. But he also adds that the boys are driven by their hormones and can be taught to behave. He argues that the boys be allowed to accompany the women, if they choose to leave.They prepare to leave at sunrise, concealing their plans from Klaas. August teaches Ona how to read a map and how to navigate by looking at the stars.
Mariche has to return home to Klaas. Klaas gets very drunk and starts hitting his daughter when he finds that she has taken the horses in preparation for their departure the next day. Mariche reveals their plans to Klaas and ends up with a broken arm and a severely bruise face.
August, at Ona's behest, posts the documents stating the pros and cons of leaving and staying on the walls as an ""artifact"" of the women's time in the colony. He also declares his love to Ona and gives her a map for the women to use.Before they can leave, Melvin tells Salome that her teenage son Aaron (Nathaniel McParland) has fled and hidden. He is found but cannot be convinced to leave in enough time. Salome, breaking the rules of their departure, tranquilizes Aaron, forcing him to leave with them. She reveals this only to August, who understands and does not question her. He asks her to look after Ona and reveals his intent to kill himself once the women are gone. She instead asks him to teach the boys properly to prevent any further violence and to give him purpose. Helena and Anna join the rest of the women, while Scarface and August watch on as they depart."

Cassie Salazar and Luke Morrow couldn't be more different. Sharp-witted Cassie works nights at a bar in Oceanside, CA, to make ends meet while pursuing her dream of becoming a singer/songwriter. Luke is a Marine trainee about to ship out for duty, who finds comfort in the unswerving discipline of service. A chance encounter at Cassie's bar changes the course of both their lives. Cassie is drowning in medical bills after being diagnosed with diabetes. Two young people, Cassie Salazar and Luke Morrow, have been taught to despise each other because of their different political identities - one progressive and one conservative. Then urgent circumstances (financial desperation) cause them to create a joint enterprise (a marriage of convenience), and they gradually learn that their political identities are not so important when the world throws a variety of challenges at them. Much more important are their personal qualities, such as empathy, integrity, consideration, loyalty, and fairness. Perhaps they can even learn to flourish in a marriage of convenience. Cassie Salazar (Sofia Carson) is a waitress/bartender and performs with her band (including Nora (Kat Cunning)), The Loyal, at a bar. Diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes six months earlier, she struggles to afford insulin and works multiple jobs to try and make ends meet. One night, she serves a group of Marines who are soon to be deployed to Iraq. One of them, Luke Morrow (Nicholas Galitzine), flirts with Cassie, but she turns him down. Luke has his own set of difficulties: he became an addict after his mom's death, and although two years clean, he still owes $15,000 to his dealer Johnno (Anthony Ippolito). Estranged from his retired Marine dad Jacob Morrow Sr. (Linden Ashby), he asks his brother Jacob Morrow Jr. (Scott Deckert) for help, but his brother declines.Cassie proposes to Frankie (Chosen Jacobs), a childhood friend and Luke's bunk-mate, to benefit from the health insurance granted to military spouses. Frankie explains he plans to marry his sweetheart Riley (Breana Raquel). Although Luke overhears and advises against a fraudulent marriage, he realizes both their financial difficulties could be solved by getting married as Luke will make more money (He gets extra spouse allowance) and Cassie will have access to military spouse health-care. They eventually agree to marry before Luke deploys. Their plan is that after a year, they will file for divorce.Frankie, the witness at the wedding, gives Cassie the ring he plans to marry Riley with, asking her to keep it safe. After, the newlyweds go to the bar with Frankie and Luke's fellow marines. Cassie argues with one of them, Armando (Nicholas Duvernay), over a toast about hunting down Arabs, resulting in an argument with Luke, but to keep up appearances they pretend to make amends.

Before he gets on the bus to leave, Luke gives Cassie contact information for his brother as she is now his next of kin. Cassie and Luke start sending emails and video calls to one another to keep up the ruse. She tells him that she wrote a song, ""Come Back Home,"" for the Marines. She performs it for them, uplifting their spirits after a rough day.The song goes viral. Luke asks Cassie if he is her muse, and Cassie concedes he may be. One night while performing, she receives a call that Luke has been severely injured after an IED went off and will be sent back.

That night, Cassie's sugar level drops, sending her into shock. Luke helps her recover and they share a kiss. The next day, Luke beats Johnno up, gives him money and tells him to stay away.

Turning Red,2022,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8097030/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A thirteen-year-old girl named Mei Lee is torn between staying her mother's dutiful daughter and the changes of adolescence. And as if the challenges were not enough, whenever she gets overly excited she transforms into a giant red panda. Meilin is a dork. Her protective, if not slightly overbearing mother, Ming, is never far from her daughter - an unfortunate reality for the teenager. And as if changes to her interests, relationships and body weren't enough, whenever she gets too excited (which is practically ALWAYS), she ""poofs"" into a big bowl of spaghetti.—Disney/Pixar Toronto, Canada, 2002. Trying to juggle her burgeoning independence and the family's expectations is about to become even more complicated when 13-year-old high-achiever Mei Lee makes an eye-opening discovery. And as her hyperactive teenage hormones kick in, having a mind of their own, Mei's emotions also take on a life of their own: whenever she gets too stressed or excited about something, Mei triggers a strange, radical metamorphosis. Can Mei Lee endure puberty and the growing pains of growing up, or will she keep turning red?—Nick Riganas In 2002, Meilin ""Mei"" Lee is a 13-year-old Chinese-Canadian girl living in Toronto. She helps take care of the family's temple dedicated to their ancestor, Sun Yee, and works to make her strict, overprotective mother Ming proud. Mei hides her personal interests from Ming, such as the fact that she and her best friends Miriam, Priya, and Abby are fans of the boy band 4*Town. When Ming discovers Mei's crush on the local convenience store clerk, she unintentionally embarrasses Mei in public, including in front of school bully Tyler.Mei has a vivid nightmare involving red pandas; when she wakes up in the morning, Mei has transformed into a large red panda. She hides from her parents and discovers that she only transforms when she is in a state of high emotion, though her hair remains red. Ming initially believes Mei is experiencing her first period, but finds out the truth when she further embarrasses Mei at school, causing Mei to transform and run home.Ming and Mei's father Jin explain that Sun Yee was granted this transformation to protect her daughters, and every female family member since then has also transformed when they came of age. This has become inconvenient and dangerous in the modern age, so the red panda spirit must be sealed in a talisman by a ritual on the night of the Red Moon; the next being in a month's time. Mei's friends discover her transformation but take a liking to it, and Mei finds that concentrating on them helps control the red panda within her.Ming allows Mei to resume her normal life but refuses to let Mei attend 4*Town's upcoming concert. Instead, the girls secretly raise money for the tickets at school, exploiting the popularity of Mei's red panda form, while lying to Ming. To cover the last ticket, Mei agrees to attend Tyler's birthday party as the red panda. At the party, Mei is upset to discover that the concert will be held on her ritual night. In the midst of her rage, she attacks Tyler when he insults her family, frightening the other children. Ming discovers Mei's activities and accuses her friends of corrupting and taking advantage of her. Ashamed and afraid to stand up to her mother, Mei fails to come to her friends' defense.Mei's grandmother Wu and Mei's aunts come to assist in her ritual, to Ming's dismay. As Mei prepares herself, Jin finds videos she took of herself as the red panda with her friends and tells her she should not be ashamed of this side of her. During the ritual, as Mei's red panda form is about to be sealed, she decides to keep her powers and abandons the ritual to attend the concert at the SkyDome. Her friends forgive her for her actions at the party, and they discover Tyler is also a 4*Town fan. However, during Mei's escape from the temple, Ming becomes so enraged that her amulet breaks and she transforms into a kaiju-sized red panda and disrupts the concert, intending to take Mei back by force.Mei and Ming argue about Mei's independence, and as they quarrel, Mei accidentally knocks her mother unconscious. Wu and the other aunts break their talismans to use their red panda forms to help drag Ming into a new ritual circle. Mei's friends and 4*Town join in singing to complete the ritual, sending Mei, Ming, and the other women to the astral plane. Mei reconciles with Ming and helps her mend her bond with Wu, whom Ming accidentally scarred in anger at some point before sealing her red panda form years ago. The other women conceal their red pandas in new talismans, but Mei decides to keep hers, and Ming accepts that she is finding her own path. Later, as the Lee family raises money to repair the damage caused at the SkyDome, Mei and Ming's relationship has improved, as Mei balances her temple duties-where her red panda is now an attraction-with spending time with her friends and their new friend Tyler."
Crimes of the Future,2022,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14549466/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Humans adapt to a synthetic environment, with new transformations and mutations. With his partner Caprice, Saul Tenser, celebrity performance artist, publicly showcases the metamorphosis of his organs in avant-garde performances. It sounds just as ambitious, taking a deep dive into the not-so-distant future in which humankind is learning to adapt to its synthetic surroundings. This evolution moves humans beyond their natural state and into a metamorphosis, which alters their biological makeup. While some embrace the limitless potential of trans-humanism, others attempt to police it. Either way, Accelerated Evolution Syndrome, is spreading fast. Saul Tenser is a beloved performance artist who has embraced this new state, sprouting new and unexpected organs in his body. Along with his partner Caprice, Tenser has turned the removal of these organs into a spectacle for his loyal followers to marvel at in real time theater. But with both the government and a strange subculture taking note, Tenser is forced to consider what would be his most shocking performance of all.—Deadline As the human species adapts to a synthetic environment, the body undergoes new transformations and mutations. With his partner Caprice, Saul Tenser, celebrity performance artist, publicly showcases the metamorphosis of his organs in avant-garde performances. Timlin, an investigator from the National Organ Registry, obsessively tracks their movements, which is when a mysterious group is revealed... Their mission - to use Saul's notoriety to shed light on the next phase of human evolution.—Neon In a not-so-distant future, humankind is learning to adapt to its synthetic surroundings. Their biological makeup changed, many humans have adapted to life with ""Accelerated Evolution Syndrome"" thanks partly to specialized equipment that aids in everything from eating to sleeping. Beloved performance artist Saul Tenser sleeps in a womb-like bed suspended in mid-air. The OrchidBed, as it's called, comes complete with software to anticipate, and adjust his every bodily need. The machine even detects the growth of new organs, which Saul's creative partner Caprice can observe and tattoo in his personal operating theatre. Together, Saul and Caprice have turned the discovery and removal of these new body organs into performance art, via sold-out voyeuristic surgical shows using a sarcophagus-like machine where the surgeries take place. These human evolutionary changes do not receive universal positivity. Before long, a new secret government entity is established - the National Organ Registry, led by bureaucrats Wippet and Timlin - to discreetly track new organ growths, with particular enthusiasm for Saul's artistic anomalies. With increased scrutiny on the syndrome and therefore his art, Saul is forced to consider what would be his most shocking performance of all.—Serendipity Point Films At an unspecified future date, significant advances in biotechnology led to the invention of machines and (analogue) computers that can directly interface with and control bodily functions, which have become the norm. Simultaneously, humankind itself has experienced several biological changes of indeterminate origin. Most significant among these changes is the disappearance of physical pain and infectious disease for an overwhelming majority (allowing for surgery to be safely performed on conscious people in ordinary settings), but other humans experience more radical alterations to their physiology. One of them, an eight-year-old boy named Brecken, displays the innate ability to consume and digest plastics as food. Convinced that he is inhuman, Brecken's mother smothers him with a pillow, leaving his corpse to be found by her ex-husband Lang.Saul Tenser and Caprice are a world-renowned performance artist couple. They take advantage of Tenser's ""accelerated evolution syndrome"", a disorder that forces his body to constantly develop new organs, by surgically removing them before a live audience. The syndrome leaves Tenser in constant pain and with severe respiratory and digestive discomfort; he is consequently reliant on several specialized bio mechanical devices, including a bed, a machine through which Caprice performs surgery on him, and a chair that twitches and rotates as it assists him with eating. Tenser and Caprice meet with bureaucrats in charge of the National Organ Registry, a governmental office designed to uphold the state's restrictions on human evolution by cataloging and storing newly evolved organs. One of the bureaucrats, the nervy Timlin, becomes captivated by Tenser's artistic goals. At a successful show of Tenser's, she tells him that ""surgery is the new sex"", a sentiment that Tenser and many other characters appear to embrace as repetitive cutting seems to be replacing traditional sex and masturbation as the preferred means of sexual gratification.A governmental police unit seeks to use Tenser to infiltrate a group of radical evolutionists. Without telling Caprice, Tenser meets a series of contacts through other biological performance art shows that lead him to the evolutionist cell. One of them, former cosmetic surgeon Nasatir, creates a zippered cavern in Tenser's stomach, which Caprice uses to access Tenser's organs in an oral sex act where she fellates his zipper wound and presumably his internal organs while he moans in erotic pleasure. Caprice continues to network with other performance artists, eventually choosing to receive decorative cosmetic surgery on her forehead.Tenser meets with Timlin, who reveals to him the agenda of the evolutionists: they have chosen to modify their digestive system to make them able to eat plastics and other synthetic chemicals. Their principal food is a purple processed ""candy bar"" of toxic waste, fatally poisonous to others. Lang is the leader of the cell; his son Brecken had been born with the ability to eat plastic, proving the inaccuracy of the government's critical stance on human evolution. Timlin tries to initiate sex with Tenser, but he says he is not good at ""the old sex"".Tenser is eventually approached by Lang, who wants Tenser and Caprice to reveal the cell's anti-government agenda through a public autopsy of Brecken that will highlight his evolved digestive system. After some deliberation, Tenser agrees. With Timlin, Lang, and many others watching, Tenser performs the autopsy, but it is revealed that Brecken's natural organ system has been surgically replaced. Lang flees the show in tears. Outside, he is approached by two agents who supposedly work for the corporation that manufactures Tenser's biomedical machines. Mimicking their earlier killing of Nasatir, they assassinate Lang by driving power drills into his head. Tenser's connection within the police unit admits that Timlin replaced Brecken's organs to keep the deviation in human evolution secret from the public. Saddened by Brecken and Lang's deaths, Tenser informs the police that he will no longer serve them, approvingly mentioning the cell's beliefs on evolution.Tenser struggles to eat in his chair. He asks Caprice to give him a bar of plastic. As Caprice records him, he eats it, looks into Caprice's camera, and sheds a tear. His mouth twitches into a smile as the chair finally quiets.

It is a life-changing story of the power of unconditional and all-consuming love. Coming to theaters January 21, 2022, REDEEMING LOVE shows there is no brokenness that love can't heal. Sarah ""Angel"", who was sold into prostitution at the age of eight, survives through hatred and self-loathing in 1850s California. When God orders Michael Hosea to marry her, he obeys him, but this command proves to be more of a challenge to him than he anticipated. Before being sold into prostitution, Sarah knows only rejection from men. As a child, she overhears her father, Alex Stanford, say that she should never have been born. Sarah learns that her father is married and her mother, Mae, is both his mistress and the victim of an abusive relationship. Sarah watches her mother grieve and eventually die, rejected by the man she loves. Now eighteen and going by the name Angel, she believes that she knows everything about men and how to give them what they want. One night, one of her customers is her father, and she knowingly has sex with him to punish him for how he treated her mother. He does not recognize her, but when he finds out the next morning, he commits suicide. When Michael enters her room and tells her he wants to marry her, she is thrown off guard, but remains aloof toward him. After she is nearly beaten to death, she agrees to marry Michael and leave with him as he nurses her back to health. Michael continues to surprise her as he claims to love her as his wife, and refuses to have sex with her. Michael is different from any man Angel has ever known, which leaves her confused and afraid to trust him. She runs away at her first opportunity, but Michael finds her and convinces her to come home. The next time Angel runs away, she gets a ride with Michael's brother-in-law, Paul, who hates her because of her past. When he demands payment for the ride, she pays by allowing Paul to have sex with her. Back in the city, Angel is forced back into prostitution, but finds it more difficult now to remain distant. When an angry Michael arrives at the brothel and takes her home again, the relief on her face when she sees him gives him hope and allows him to forgive her. For the first time, Angel is truly honest with Michael about her past, and their relationship begins to grow based on honesty and affection. Angel does not run away from Michael again for a long time. But when she is terrified to find herself falling in love with him, she remembers what love did to her mother, and forces herself to leave. This time, however, she stays away from her old life, and is able to make an honest living for the first time in her life. When Michael finds her yet again, she confesses that she ran away because she was scared to love him, and he assures her that she can trust him. She agrees to go home with him again. The final time Angel runs away, it is not because she does not love Michael, or because she is scared of her love, but out of a desire to sacrifice for him. She knows that what Michael wants most in the world is children and she is unable to bear children herself. She believes that by leaving, Michael will find someone else to marry and be happier without her. When she leaves this time, she intends to stay away forever, but Michael does not go after her, deciding that she needs to come back on her own. Angel is gone for three years, and has started a successful mission to help other young prostitutes, when Paul finally comes to find her. Paul realizes that he has been wrong all this time and tells Angel that Michael still loves her. Angel returns home to Michael, offering her love and her life. He is overjoyed when she gives him the only gift she has left to give, that being her real name, Sarah. God shows his faithfulness to Michael and Sarah throughout their lives, miraculously blessing them with children and success in all their endeavors, and they are happily married for the rest of their lives."

As Maya and Christos attack Adam, The Adams are rescued by Laura who reveals that she had escaped an assassination attempt on her (after she analyzed the jump logs and saw an entry of a plane coming back from 2018, when nobody ever flew to 2018) and was left stranded in the past (for the last 4 yrs). Laura had learned that Sorian had traveled back in time and altered the past in order to give herself control of time travel and the future.
Nov 2018 was when Louis developed the Magnetic particle accelerator, the first step towards time travel.Laura urges Adam to travel back to 2018 and destroy time travel, which was created by his father Louis, in order to set things right and save the future. Adam is afraid that if changes the past, Adam and Laura may never meet in the future.

Adam argues that Maya already impacted the time-stream and took control of the future of human destiny. When Louis refuse to relent, Adam tells him to care for his son, rather than caring for the universe all the time.
Meanwhile Future Sorian travels to 2018 and meets her younger self. She had traveled to 2018 before to alter the time stream in cahoots with her younger self. Future Sorian reveals that Adam from the future is also in 2018 and is determined to eradicating the technology that enables time travel.Adam12 confronts his future self about his bitterness and anger and realizes that the source of it is his lingering pain over their father's death & nothing else. As the two launch an attack to destroy Louis' particle accelerator, Louis changes his mind and joins the mission, having them instead retrieve the hard drive containing the only copy of his algorithm that enables time travel (by stabilizing the wormholes).
Adam and Louis go down to the basement where the accelerator is housed, while Adam12 guards the perimeter with drones. Adam12 is captured by Sorian from the future. She brings Adam12 to the basement to negotiate with Adam and Louis.A battle erupts between the Adams, Louis, Sorian, her younger self, Sorian's soldiers and Christos, resulting in the particle accelerator overloading. Sorian attempts to shoot Louis with an armor-piercing bullet, but the magnetic field of the accelerator instead diverts the round, causing it to kill the younger Sorian, erasing the future Sorian from existence as the Reeds flee.With time travel destroyed and the future set right, Louis chooses not to learn of his own fate and enjoys a game of catch with both versions of his son before the Adams are returned to their own times. In 2022, Adam12 lets go of his bitterness and anger and reconciles with his mother whom he has been distant with ever since Louis' death.

They suspect her because of her insufficient displays of grief, a scratch on her hand, bruises on her legs and torso, and a tattoo of Ki's initials in the manner that he marked his other belongings.Hae-Jun does nightly stakeouts outside of Seo-Rae's apartment building, becoming obsessed with her and imagining himself inside her apartment. Seo-Rae discovers him stalking her and tails his other investigations in turn. Seo-Rae's Monday client says that Seo-Rae was with her on the day that Ki died. Seo-Rae admits that in China, she killed her mother with fentanyl pills because her mother was terminally ill and asked her to do so. Before dying, she told Seo-Rae to go to Korea to claim the mountain her Korean grandfather, an independence fighter in Manchuria, had left her. Soo-Wan and Hae-Jun discover letters from Ki admitting to being a corrupt immigration official and a letter sent to Ki's subordinate that they interpret as a suicide letter. Hae-Jun concludes that the death is a suicide and informs Seo-Rae that she is no longer a suspect.Seo-Rae and Hae-Jun go on a date at a Buddhist temple, visit each other's homes, and become close. Seo-Rae burns the photo evidence from her husband's case, reasoning that Hae-Jun's insomnia is caused by his haunting cases. One day, she has Hae-Jun substitute for her at her Monday client. Hae-Jun learns that Seo-Rae and the client have the same model of cell phone, and the client has dementia and does not know the day of the week. On the client's cell phone, he sees that the housebound woman apparently walked up 138 flights of stairs on the day of Ki's death. Hae-Jun realizes that Seo-Rae switched phones with her client on the day of the murder and then climbed the mountain to push Ki off. She also forged his suicide note and got close to Hae-Jun to destroy his evidence. Hae-Jun tells Seo-Rae that she has destroyed his pride in his job and that, since meeting her, he has become ""shattered"", but instructs her to throw the incriminating phone into the sea.Thirteen months later, Hae-Jun has moved to Ipo to live with Jung-An after developing depression and more severe insomnia. At the fish market with Jung-An, he encounters Seo-Rae with Im Ho-Shin, her new husband, a business investor. The next day, Ho-Shin is found dead in his mansion's swimming pool. Hae-Jun is convinced Seo-Rae is the culprit. She admits only to draining the pool so that Hae-Jun would not be disturbed by the blood. Sa Cheol-Seong, a Chinese immigrant, soon confesses to killing Ho-Shin for defrauding his late mother of millions of dollars. Sa denies that Seo-Rae played any role and reveals he had installed a tracker on Seo-Rae's phone so he knew where she was at all times. Hae-Jun learns that Seo-Rae visited Sa's mother in the hospital and the mother died later that day. He concludes that Seo-Rae slipped the mother the remaining fentanyl pills she had in her possession, because Sa had threatened to kill Ho-Shin as soon as his mother died.Jung-An leaves Hae-Jun, suspecting an affair with Seo-Rae. Hae-Jun confronts Seo-Rae at the mountain her grandfather left her. She tells him that Ho-Shin had discovered a phone recording where Hae-Jun told Seo-Rae that he loved her and he had threatened to expose their illicit relationship. Hae-Jun doesn't recall telling Seo-Rae that he loved her, though she says she began loving him as he stopped loving her. She reaches Hae-Jun at the edge of the mountain and hugs him. They kiss passionately.The next day, while Seo-Rae drives to the beach, Hae-Jun finds the cell phone with the recording. In it, he tells Seo-Rae to destroy the phone with incriminating evidence from Ki's case. At a beach, Seo-Rae digs a pit in the sand and gets in it as the tide rises, letting it drown and bury her, so that she will forever remain an unsolved mystery in Hae-Jun's mind. Hae-Jun arrives at the beach and is unable to find Seo-Rae, although he is actually standing on her grave. He searches desperately for her and cries in anguish."

Two-time Academy Award® nominee Carey Mulligan (Promising Young Woman, An Education) and Emmy nominee Zoe Kazan (The Plot Against America, The Big Sick) star as New York Times reporters Megan Twohey and Jodi Kantor, who together broke one of the most important stories in a generation--a story that shattered decades of silence around the subject of sexual assault in Hollywood and impelled a shift in American culture that continues to this day.—Official synopsis New York City, 2016.Jodi KantorandMegan Twohey, journalists for the New York Times, have spent months reaching out to abuse survivors to open up to them about predatory Hollywood producerHarvey Weinstein's sexual misconduct and power abuse. For this reason, the two working mothers deal with stress and exhaustion as they uncover a three-decade history of intimidation, extreme harassment, and rape that spans as far back as the 1980s. And in their unrelenting pursuit of the truth, the two investigative reporters confront years of silence and an extensive, well-organised system protecting male abusers. But as the two journalists give the objectified women a chance to tell their stories, their detailed accounts of repeated harassment and sexual assault spark a global movement. As a result, their noble cause helped inspire women to speak out and seek justice.—Nick Riganas In the 1990s, a young, happy female production assistant watches a scene on a movie set during the revolutionary war being filmed on a beach. Cut to this same girl running down a city street, crying uncontrollably.In 2016, New York Times journalist Megan Twohey (Carey Mulligan) speaks with a young woman - Rachel - about speaking out against Donald Trump, who is running for president. The woman is hesitant and wants to know if the Times would cover her legal costs if she needs them after coming forward. Megan says they can't help with legal fees. The woman would be on her own but feels comfortable if another woman is on board as well. Then she agrees to go on record.New York Times Journalist Jodi Kantor (Zoe Kazan) juggles her two young daughters while getting ready for work. It's not easy.A pregnant Megan is sick in bed as her husband takes care of her while Jodi's husband leads them in a Jewish holiday prayer for their family. Megan receives a call from Trump. He denies the girls' accounts.A news story runs the next day- several women speaking out against Trump. It's everywhere. Megan's source, Rachel, is trapped inside her house. Cameramen are camped outside her house. Megan suggests writing things down and taping any conversations. An exhausted Megan gets a call from a woman calling for Bill O'Reilly. She wants to know if Megan thinks of herself as a feminist. Megan lets out a big sigh.Then Megan gets a threatening call from a man saying he will kill her and dump her body in the river. News anchors announce Trump wins the presidency as Fox News dismisses Bill O'Reilly. Jodi works with another reporter on women's claims of inappropriate nature. Her editor, Rebecca Corbett (Patricia Clarkson), commends her work.Jodi and Rebecca start a new topic - corporate misuse of power or workplaces where harassment might happen. Jodi speaks to the head of a feminist group who says the wrongdoing in Hollywood is overwhelming. Rose McGown tweeted about being raped by a producer, who the feminist head says is film producer Harvey Weinstein.Weinstein was accused by another Italian model who claimed Weinstein groped her in a business meeting several years ago. NYPD investigated it, but he was never charged. Jodi must track down and talk to Rose and other actresses he's worked with and ex-employees but gets nowhere.Megan and her husband are able to hear the heartbeat of their unborn child while Jodi continues to track down people who worked with or for Weinstein. Finally, Jodi gets a call from Rose, but she's not inclined to talk to the Times because of the way she's been treated by the paper in the past. Rose isn't willing to put herself on the line again because she's spoken up in the past and nothing ever changed. Jodi tells her she has written about Amazon, Starbucks, and Harvard Business School, and change happened as a result of her articles. Jodi's husband tries to talk about serious topics, but Jodi is really wrapped up in the workplace/ Weinstein research.She watches a clip of Ashley Judd at a rally. She reads an article Ashley wrote about being harassed in the 90s. Megan struggles with Postpartum depression, and her husband talks her through it.Rose McGown calls Jodi back and suggests Jodi expands beyond Weinstein. Hollywood is full of abusers, calling it ""white men on a playground."" Rose then tells her at a meeting, Weinstein talked projects with her and then mentioned he has a Jacuzzi in his room. She didn't know how to respond, so she just kept talking. Later, they were walking down the hallway, and he mentioned, ""this is the Jacuzzi room"" she didn't know what to say, but once he pushed her inside, he stripped her clothes off, and she had an out-of-body experience as he raped her. She went into survival mode to get out. He left messages saying she was his special friend.She didn't report it because she didn't think the police would take her side. She told people, but no one did a thing. Jodi wants to contact the people Rose told, but Rose warns Weinstein will have spies watching Jodi now.Jodi calls Megan at home. They discuss motherhood, and Jodi can tell Megan is struggling. Then they discuss how the women are finding it hard to talk to Jodi and go on the record. Jodi asks Megan how she got women to speak in the past, and Megan says though it's hard, and she can't change what happened to you in the past, but together we may be able to use what happened to you to help other people.Jodi talks to Ashley Judd over zoom. Ashley goes over how Weinstein harassed her. What was supposed to be a business meeting turned into Weinstein asking for a massage, then asking her to pick out his suit, getting closer and closer. Ashley could only say no so many different times in so many different ways. She got out of there fast. She told her dad, agent, and people she was filming with that day. Then she was stonewalled by others. Today she knows it was Weinstein making a phone call to have people ice her out of roles she was up for.Jodi receives an email from Lisa Bloom, daughter of feminist icon Gloria Allred. Turns out Weinstein and Jay-Z are producing a series based on Lisa's book. Jodi's colleague points out Weinstein must have had Lisa reach out to Jodi, which means Weinstein knows that Jodi's looking into his past.At work, Megan and Jodi discuss expanding the story to people who don't have a platform, unlike actresses. Megan suggests she can search for police complaints and court records against Miramax, Weinstein's producing company. Jodi and Megan team up to continue the story.Jodi and Megan have lunch, and Jodi says Lena Dunham and Jenni Konner want to help but then Megan gets a call from the investigator on the sexual harassment cases, but he doesn't know what Miramax is.Megan is able to track down an old assistant who disappeared from Miramax. Megan shows up at the woman's mother's house, but the woman is actually there. The woman immediately changes her demeanor. She starts to breathe fast and chooses her words wisely. ""All I can say is that I had a business dispute that was resolved amicably, and we've agreed not to discuss it."" Megan says in the past, they've written around NDAs, and sources can remain anonymous regardless of settlements. But the woman doesn't want to be involved.Jodi gets a call from Gwyneth Paltrow while Megan approaches the (former?) CFO of Miramax at his house. With his wife in the room, he has trouble dismissing Megan.Megan calls the equal employment opportunities commission to confirm which companies have the most sexual harassment complaints, but they can't help because it's confidential.Jodi meets Gwyneth at her house. We don't see Gwyneth but Jodi reports back to work that it's a pattern of behavior. Weinstein invited Gwyneth to the hotel under the guise of a ""business meeting"" and then threatened her with losing her job if she refused to have sex with Weinstein.They discover:
NDAs are rarely examined, barely come up in open court, and law schools don't teach them. Also, attorneys who represent the victims can get up to 40% of the settlement. Most sexual harassment cases are settled. The women must give over all diaries, emails, and recordings. It's cash for silence.Then Rebecca asks how close the women are to going on the record. The horrific hotel accounts without corroborating evidence won't help the story. The Times executive editor Dean (Andre Braugher) wants any comment from Weinstein to be on the record and tells Jodi and Megan to assume any conversation with him is being recorded.Next, we hear the Italian model Ambra Battilana Gutierez's recording of the night Harvey Weinstein tried to coerce her into his hotel room.Megan calls a source who used to work at the D.A.'s office. She brings up that Weinstein wasn't charged on a certain case, and it was irregularly handled. The DA source says there wasn't any criminal conduct there. Megan pushed because there was a recording.Jodi gets a call from a panicked Gwyneth Paltrow. Weinstein has turned up to her house party. Gwyneth has locked herself in her own bathroom to avoid him. Jodi asks if Gwyneth feels she's in danger, but Gwyneth feels that Weinstein is sending a message that he's letting her know he knows.Jodi and Megan go to lunch with Rebecca. There they learn that Ronin Farrow is also working on a story about Weinstein. There, a man approaches them, trying to pick up one of the ladies. Megan tries to be polite, but the guy won't take no for an answer. Then Megan yells at him to go away, and that catches everyone in the restaurant's attention. She apologizes, but Jodi says no apology is necessary.Jodi meets an ex-Miramax assistant at an upscale restaurant. She becomes emotional and gives the names of two assistants and a third woman Jodi should talk to. Rowena Chung, Zelda Perkins, and Laura Madden. But they all live in London, Silicon Valley, and Wales. Rebecca tells Jodi they absolutely need documents and verification.Jodi goes to Rowena's house, but Rowena's husband is there doing yard work. Rowena isn't home. He's confused because Rowena never told him about her experiences with Weinstein. Jodi feels terrible for letting the cat out of the bag and immediately leaves.Jodi talks to Megan on the phone. She has hit another brick wall. A UK lawyer told her to don't bother with getting around NDAs because no one ever does it. Megan tells her to forget that guy, but she uses a different f-word.Jodi calls Laura Madden. However, Laura is having medical issues at this time. Her young children are really troubled by her diagnosis. Laura breaks down in her call with Jodi.Jodi has tea with Zelda in London. Zelda says people have tried to write this story before, but Weinstein always shut it down. Jodi assures her they will do everything, so that doesn't happen. Zelda discusses how she fended Harvey off with humor and regression. She would wear puffer jackets or sit in an armchair, not on a couch. Zelda can't share all her experiences at the Venice Film Festival because of the NDA. But one morning, Rowena came to Zelda in tears. She was crying uncontrollably. Zelda went to confront Weinstein, who was in a meeting with Scorsese. She walked straight up to him and said, ""You need to come with me right now,"" and he did. He denied it. He swore on his wife and children.Rowena and Zelda came back to London and resigned. They talked to a lawyer. Zelda told her direct superior, who suggested they get a good lawyer. But 20-year-olds don't know where to get lawyers, so they feel overwhelmed. Called a firm close to the office, but they said the girls had no chance, no case, no police report from Venice, and no evidence. The lawyers kept saying a settlement was the only way to go because, with rape, it is impossible to get a prosecution.Zelda insisted no money should change hands. But the girls would sign on certain conditions: 1- If Weinstein had another settlement within two years, it would have to be reported to Disney, or else he would be fired. 2- He would go to therapy with Zelda present initially so that he couldn't lie. 3- H.R. would assign an assistant to protect the women on the staff. If the girls could achieve those, that was what their silence was paying for.The Weinstein Company had its own conditions, but the girls had to remember them because they wouldn't give them their own copies. Only visitation rights to their settlements. 1- the girls wouldn't help the police in a criminal or civil case. 2- They couldn't talk to their families or therapists about their experiences.Zelda interviewed for jobs after, but everyone would only say, ""why did you leave Harvey?"" She would never work in the entertainment industry again. She moved to Guatemala and worked with horses. Zelda then gives Jodi all the documents she had.Jodi talks to her daughters over zoom. It's been challenging while she's been in the U.K., but her oldest daughter asks her what she is reporting on. Jodi doesn't feel comfortable sharing this topic with such a young girl, and then her daughter asks if it's about rape. Jodi asks her where she learned that ""grown-up"" word. The daughter says schoolmates say it often and apologizes. Jodi says she doesn't have to apologize because she did nothing wrong. Even though Jodi is trying to protect her daughter from the cruel world, its ugliness still shows up.Laura Madden gets a call from an old colleague who asks if she's been approached by ""roach"" reporters. The colleague says working for Harvey in the past was great, and if Laura had a project, the colleague could bring it to Harvey now. Laura picks up what the lady is lying down and says she'll talk to whom she pleases and hangs up.Laura arranges a meeting with Jodi, who hops on a train the next day. Laura was a production assistant in the 1990s. She was assigned to Weinstein. One morning he asked for a massage while he was naked. She turned him down. He said it's not sexual, and all the girls do it. It's just work. He then commanded her to take her top off, bra off, and trousers off. Then Laura asked him to leave her alone. But he carried on. Next, he's in the shower, touching himself. And her crying annoyed him. She ran out of there, and we're taken to the beginning of the film. Laura is the P.A. running down a city street, crying uncontrollably.She carried on with such shame, and she assumed other girls were stronger to refuse him. It was like he took her voice that day, just as she was finding it.Back in New York, Weinstein calls the Times. Dean suggests Weinstein talk to the reporters on the record. Weinstein mentions he loves the truth.The reporters, lawyers, and editors regroup. The documents from Zelda are the most significant thing, but no one can go on the record because of their NDAs, and the famous actresses aren't ready to go on the record even though they didn't sign NDAs.Megan and Jodi meet with Weinstein's lawyer, Lanny Davis, at the Times offices. He acknowledges that men these days are learning what consensual actually means, including Harvey. The lawyer talks a little too much, which leads Megan to ask a question that the lawyer doesn't know how to answer. He needs to figure out what his legal options are. She asked, ""how many settlements?""Jodi gets a call in the middle of the night. The woman only says, ""I used to work at Miramax. Talk to Irwin Reiter."" The next scene shows Jodi with Reiter, and she asks Reiter if he can confirm the settlements and if company money was used. Before Reiter leaves, he asks why she is so interested in the 90s settlements when there's been so many recently. This is a revelation Jodi wasn't expecting.Megan heard that Ambra Battilana Gutierrez got a seven-figure settlement, and Weinstein now owns the recording. Megan questions Lanny Davis about it. He confirms that it's eight to twelve settlements.Megan and Jodi talk about their nightmares and sleepless nights and worry about whether or not people will care once the story runs. However, neither regret signing up for this story.Jodi meets again with Reiter. She asks for proof of the settlements. He doesn't help her.Rowena calls Jodi out of the blue. They meet in New York. Rowena grew up in a Chinese household which prioritized protecting the family. Late one night while working for Weinstein, Rowena and he was going over scripts and notes. He made it a game, held her down, and begged for ""just one thrust."" She ran out of there and went to Zelda's room. Like Zelda, she couldn't find work again. Rowena agreed to take a job in Hong Kong for the Weinstein Company, but her trauma changed her. She tried to commit suicide.Jodi meets with Reiter again. Without naming the actress, she shows him a document with a detailed account of how Weinstein assaulted her. He didn't think it was anything like that.He brings up a memo on his phone and leaves for the restroom, and tells her, ""do with it what you want."" Jodi starts taking multiple pictures of it with her phone. It's an internal memo that circulated at Miramax in 2015 detailing abuse allegations against Weinstein from a former employee.Jodi reads the memo from Lauren O'Conner. She is an ex-Miramax employee who wrote the board. In it, she details her account and Weinstein's abuse of power. Rebecca talks with Lauren's attorney. They plan to use Lauren's name in the article for credibility though they will say Lauren is not the source of the memo.Jodi and Megan begin to write the story. They plan to tell their sources publication is imminent. And they reach out to the Weinstein company for comment.Jodi reaches out to Ashley Judd again. Ideally, a group of women jumping together would be best, but that's not what's happening. They do have a mountain of evidence and predatory pattern.
Yet, Ashley would be coming forward alone. Ashley promises to think about it seriously.Jodi vents to Megan her frustration of not being able to convince just one woman to go on the record. The group waits for two hours for a call from Weinstein and his lawyer. Weinstein wants to know who they have talked to, especially if they talked to Gwyneth.Ashley Judd calls Jodi while finishing her run in the mountains. She agrees to be named in the article, which brings Jodi to tears.The lead of the article now is Ashley Judd's account of the Peninsula hotel. They publish as soon as the piece is in good shape. Everything comes together, and they get confirmation of eight to twelve settlements though Lanny Davis writes up a response that could be a novel.Weinstein shows up at the Times offices. In the conference room, the group deals with an irate Weinstein. Weinstein and the company try to discredit the actresses with statements in Variety and Hollywood Reporter. He claims to be surprised by the Times article. And keeps asking if Gwyneth Paltrow is in the article and if they have talked to Gwyneth.Laura Madden calls Jodi before she goes in for surgery. She also agrees to be named in the article since she didn't sign an NDA. She's speaking out for the women who can't speak for themselves.The Times publishes the article on October 5, 2017. Follow-up articles are published. Other women come forward with more allegations against Weinstein. There is a global shift in attitudes, and the rise of the Me Too movement places a spotlight on this behavior."
Vengeance,2022,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11976532/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A writer from New York City attempts to solve the murder of a girl he hooked up with and travels down south to investigate the circumstances of her death and discover what happened to her. Months after a few one night stands, New York City writer Ben finds out a girl he barely knows has died. He's talked into flying to the middle of nowhere in Texas for her funeral where her brother vows to find out who killed her... and seek vengeance. New York City journalist Ben Manalowitz lives a metropolitan life of casual romantic relationships. Late one night, he receives a phone call from a stranger, Ty Shaw, informing him that his ""girlfriend,"" Abilene ""Abby"" Shaw, has died of an apparent drug overdose. In actuality, Abby was one of Ben's many casual romantic relationships whom Ben barely remembers. At Ty's insistence, Ben flies to Texas to attend the funeral. He meets Abby's family: brother Ty, mother Sharon, sisters Paris and Kansas City, younger brother Mason (referred to as ""El Stupido""), and Granny Carole.Ty informs Ben that he suspects Abby was actually murdered, adamantly maintaining that she never took drugs, and asks Ben to accompany him to find the truth and avenge her. After conferring with his podcast producer Eloise, Ben elects to aid them as part of a story about grief and denial.Ben and Ty meet Ty's friend Crawl, who explains that parties often occur at the oil fields and tells Ben of an area nearby the fields dubbed ""the Afterparty"", an area between law enforcement jurisdictions where dead bodies have been reported over time. Crawl and Ty suspect Sancholo, a local drug dealer, as responsible for Abby's death. Ben meets Quentin Sellers, an eccentric record producer, in the midst of working with a teenaged female singer; like Ben, Quentin is an outsider and college-educated but has come to adopt Texas as his home. He gives Ben a memory stick with recordings of Abby performing. Ben confronts Sancholo to discuss Abby's death, who reveals he was in Tulsa at the time. Ben later joins the Shaw family at a rodeo, where he accidentally draws the crowd's ire by expressing support for the Texas Longhorns when the crowd is overwhelmingly in favor of the Texas Tech Red Raiders.Ben's car explodes. Later, Ben receives a call from Eloise, telling him that the story is complete - and his best ever - and expects him to now return to New York. At dinner with the Shaws at Whataburger, Granny mentions that Abby was, in fact, a drug user and that Ty had lied about that to Ben, wanting to get closer to her (supposed) boyfriend. Leaving the restaurant, Ben reveals that he was not close with Abby and criticizes the Shaws' lives and mentalities.Later, Mason mentions how Abby would speak in code with him, saying ""1435"" (for the letters in ""I love you mucho""). Enlightened, Ben uses the number to unlock Abby's phone, finding a contact labeled ""Ben"", which Abby did to make her family believe she was texting with a New York boyfriend (thus the Shaws' misunderstanding). The last few messages indicate that Abby was abandoned by the unknown Texas ""Ben"" as she lay dying.Armed with one of Ty's pistols, Ben rides with Mason to a party at the oil fields. Ben learns that his car was bombed by Texas Tech fans from the rodeo. Ben finds Ty and Quentin, and the latter invites him to a private tent to converse. Inside, Ben notices a stash of opioids and witnesses the teenage singer from earlier being dragged away to ""the Afterparty"". After turning off his recorder, Ben elicits a confession from Quentin, who confirms that he caused Abby to overdose and left her to die. Ben reveals that he actually recorded the confession on his phone, to which Quentin responds with a speech about the nature of Ben's story and how ever-questioning audiences will shift their negative attention from Quentin (who only ""left somebody to die"" of their own overdose) to Ben and then toward the Shaws. Ben executes Quentin with Ty's pistol.Upon returning to the Shaw house, Ben reconciles with Ty and Sharon. Before departing from Texas, Ben remotely deletes all copies of his recordings, electing to keep the story between the Shaws and himself. (thanks to Wikipedia)"

Having spent centuries bringing gifts and spreading holiday cheer to children around the world, disillusioned Santa Claus now toys with the idea of hanging up his boots. Instead, he is in for a nasty surprise when he sets foot in the lavish Lightstone mansion and realises Christmas-hating Scrooge and his armed-to-the-teeth mercenaries have taken 7-year-old Trudy and her family hostage. Now, there's no turning back. Are the bad guys prepared for an unlikely opponent and a long, bloody, violent night?—Nick Riganas On Christmas Eve, Santa Claus drinks at a pub in Bristol where he laments to a mall Santa how the kids have begun to lose their Christmas spirit and have become increasingly materialistic.

They are joined by Jason's alcoholic sister Alva, her new boyfriend and wannabe-action star Morgan Steele, and Alva's son Bertrude. After realizing he didn't take Trudy to the mall to see Santa, Jason implores Linda to make up with him with Jason promising to quit his job working for Gertrude and leave it all behind. He finds an old walkie talkie which he gives to Trudy to ""talk to Santa.""Santa arrives at the Lightstone estate to deliver gifts, when the catering staff and some servants reveal themselves to be part of a group of mercenaries, led by a man known as ""Mr. Scrooge"" where they all use Christmas code-names, and take the family hostage.

The Wonder,2022,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9288822/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A tale of two strangers who transform each other's lives, a psychological thriller, and a story of love pitted against evil. Set in The Irish Midlands in 1862, the story follows a young girl who stops eating but remains miraculously alive and well. English nurse Lib Wright is brought to a tiny village to observe eleven-year old Anna O'Donnell. Tourists and pilgrims mass to witness the girl who is said to have survived without food for months. Is the village harbouring a saint 'surviving on manna from heaven' or are there more ominous motives at work? Set in the Irish mid-lands 1862 a tale of two strangers who transform each other's lives, a psychological thriller, and a story of love pitted against the stoic beliefs of a cultural bias embedded in local religious norms. A truly gripping tale pitted against the altruistic beliefs of a Nurse who is asked to balance Medical Science against the generational held beliefs of a cultural bias embedded in religious dogma of the day. She has been brought in to observe but not to interfere with the Watch, the Wishes of God's miracle as the young Girl Anna is starving to death!—jhasapopoulos In 1862, Elizabeth ""Lib"" Wright (Florence Pugh), an English nurse who served in the Crimean War, is sent to a rural village in Ireland where she is tasked with closely watching Anna O'Donnell (Kíla Lord Cassidy), a fasting girl who according to her family has not eaten for four months. She stays at a local tavern run by Sean (David Wilmot) and Maggie Ryan (Ruth Bradley). The committee (headed by John Flynn (Brían F. O'Byrne), local doctor Dr McBrearty (Toby Jones) & Sir Otway (Dermot Crowley)) gives her 2 weeks to observe and report her findings. Anna is not to be fed forcefully, neither refused food if she asks for it.She is to be assisted by a nun, Sister Michael (Josie Walker), and the two are to report their findings independently to a council of local dignitaries. The trauma of the Great Famine still looms over the community (and the Irish blames the English for it), and many locals are wary of the English nurse. Lib meets Anna's deeply religious family: her mother Rosaleen (Elaine Cassidy), her father Malachy (Caolán Byrne) and her elder sister Kitty (Niamh Algar). At dinner, Lib learns that Anna's elder brother died of an unknown illness. Anna herself appears in good health and says she has been kept alive by consuming ""manna from Heaven"". Lib suggests shifting Anna to the hospital, but Rosaleen refuses.Lib, still grieving for the death of her only child, takes laudanum to help her sleep. She is widowed, and was married to her husband for only a year.
At her lodgings, Lib encounters William Byrne (Tom Burke), a man who grew up locally and whose family perished in the Great Famine while he was away at boarding school. Now a journalist for the Daily Telegraph, William is reporting on the story, which he believes to be a hoax. Lib and William become intimately involved. Lib's observations initially reveal no evidence of deception. Anna prays many times a day and speaks of the fate of the damned in Hell.Noticing that her mother kisses Anna goodnight on her mouth while cupping her face, Lib deduces that chewed food is being covertly passed to Anna. She forbids the family from touching her. William says that by doing this Lib has condemned Anna to death as her family cannot confess the truth. If they confess, they will be driven from their home and tried for fraud.
Anna does not deny that this is her ""manna"" (She says it was a holy secret, and the chewed up food was delivered to her by God, via her mother), and she discloses to Lib the reasons for her fast: her elder brother had repeatedly sexually assaulted her, and she attributes his death to God's wrath. Anna believes that by sacrificing her life she will free her brother's soul from the ceaseless burning in hell. Separated from her family's touch, Anna's condition worsens.
Lib begs Dr McBearty to stop the watch and force Anna to eat. Dr McBearty speculates that maybe Anna has developed some capacity to convert sunlight into energy.
William files a report to his paper in which he lays the blame for Anna's expected death on her family and the community.Lib informs the council of her findings (That Anna was being fed by her mother), but they refuse to believe her. Sister Michael states that she had found no evidence of Rosaleen feeding Anna. Members of the council question Anna, but she repeats that she is sustained solely by ""manna from Heaven"". Knowing that Anna will inevitably die unless she eats soon, Lib pleads for the family to take action, or at least for her mother to resume the kisses. Rosaleen refuses, saying that after Anna's sacred death, both her children will be in heaven. Lib persuades William to assist with a rescue plan. While the family are at mass, Lib brings Anna, now near death, to a nearby holy Clootie well. She tells her that although ""Anna"" will die, she will be reborn as a new girl named ""Nan"". Anna closes her eyes and appears to die. When she revives, Lib is finally able to feed her. Lib returns to the house alone and sets it ablaze, at the same time deliberately destroying her laudanum bottle.Lib tells the council that Anna died of natural causes, and that the fire was an accident. The committee is distraught since Anna would have been their first saint since the dark ages. Concerned for their own possible culpability for Anna's death, and in the absence of a body within the charred remains of the house, they terminate her employment without pay. Sister Michael tells Lib that, after leaving mass early, she saw a vision of Anna and an angel leaving the area on horseback. She asks Lib to swear that Anna has gone to a better place.In Dublin, Lib reunites with William and Nan, who has recovered her health. The three pose as a family named Cheshire and set sail for Sydney."
The Outfit,2022,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14114802/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"An expert cutter must outwit a dangerous group of mobsters in order to survive a fateful night. Leonard (Mark Rylance), a master English tailor who's ended up in Chicago, operates a corner tailor shop with his assistant (Zoey Deutch) where he makes beautiful clothes for the only people around who can afford them: a family of vicious gangsters. One night, two killers (Dylan O'Brien, Johnny Flynn) knock on his door in need of a favor - And Leonard is thrust onto the board in a deadly game of deception and murder. In 1956 Chicago, Leonard Burling (Mark Rylance) is an English cutter who runs a custom tailor shop in a neighborhood controlled by Irish Mob boss Roy Boyle (Simon Russell Beale). Roy's son and second-in-command, Richie (Dylan O'Brien), and his chief enforcer, Francis (Johnny Flynn), use Leonard's shop as a stash house for dirty money; Leonard tolerates this arrangement as the Boyles and their men are his best customers. Leonard also shares a complicated relationship with shop receptionist Mable (Zoey Deutch), who is also Richie's girlfriend.
Mable yearns to get out of this life in Chicago, which is controlled by the mob. Mable wants to travel the world. Mable is clear that she will never train to become a tailor like Leonard or take over the shop like he wants.
Mable says that she has been around men like Richie all her life. She says that the best way to deal with them is to let them know that you are one of them.Richie dislikes Francis as Francis has the ear of Richie's father Roy.
One night, Francis shows up at the shop with Richie, who's been shot in the belly after a confrontation with the rival LaFontaine family. Leonard is forced at gunpoint to treat Richie's wounds and hide a briefcase containing a copy of an FBI recording with detailed information on the crew's operations, which was provided by ""The Outfit"", a nationwide syndicate founded by Al Capone. Francis gets in touch with Roy and departs, leaving Leonard and Richie alone. Richie believes that there is a rat in their organization, as the LaFontaines seem to know their every move, and believes that the recording will reveal the rat's identity. Leonard suggests to Richie that Francis is the rat.
Leonard says that he used to apprentice for years at a tailor shop in London and learned his craft. He came to Chicago, as London was poor after the first world war and people could not afford the nice things in life, like the suits he stitches. Due to poverty, people took to cheap blue jeans, which became all the rage.When Francis returns, Leonard intercepts him, claiming that Richie is light-headed and delusional from blood loss. Leonard says that Richie is fiddling with the tape and wants to know who the rat is. Francis meets Richie and says that he found a hi-tech guy who can play the tape. Francis wants to take the tape and play it to figure out who the rat is.
Leonard had already convinced Richie that if Francis has the tape, he could paint anybody as the rat, even if Francis himself was the rat.Richie wants Francis to wait till Roy gets to the shop. Francis insists that he wants to identify the rat immediately. They both struggle for the briefcase and it falls open, revealing that there was no tape inside it. Both believe the other took it.
Richie threatens Francis, who kills him. He and Leonard hide Richie's body just as Roy arrives with his bodyguard Monk (Alan Mehdizadeh). The two men lie and tell Roy that Richie left the store on his own and took the tape with him; Francis volunteers to go find him.
Roy starts chatting with Leonard and tells him that The Outfit is like the United Nations of the underworld. After Al Capone's death it became a network and worked to protect its members. The Outfit is considering Roy and his organization for membership. To complete the process, Roy needs to destroy the LaFontaines. That tape was provided by The Outfit to help Roy find the rat in his organization. If the tape gets out, their chances of joining The Outfit will come crashing down.
The tape was made by the FBI by placing a recording device inside a hidden location and the Outfit was able to get a copy of it through their contacts.Roy notices Richie's coat in the store's backroom and threatens Leonard. Leonard says that Richie went out threatening to kill LaFontaine.
Francis then returns with Mable in tow, claiming that he found Richie's blood in her apartment and suggesting that she is the rat. When Roy orders his men to torture her for information, Leonard distracts him by revealing the reason why he came to Chicago: his wife and daughter were killed in a fire at his former shop and home on Savile Row.The shop's phone rings and Leonard answers it; he lies that the call was from Richie, who is waiting for Roy. Roy and Monk depart but Francis insists on staying. Leonard convinces Francis to betray Roy by using Mable, who really is the rat and has been selling information to LaFontaine and the FBI. Mable had hoped that Roy and the LaFontaines would kill each other and she would be able to get away from Richie. Leonard tells Francis that he stole the tape and hid it.
Roy's death at LaFontaine's hands will allow Francis to take over Roy's business. At Leonard's urging, Mable calls Violet LaFontaine (Nikki Amuka-Bird) to give her Roy's location and offer to sell her the recording. Francis hides at the back of the store when Violet arrives, intending to kill her, but Leonard warns Violet and her bodyguards shoot Francis twice instead. Mable takes the payment, and Violet leaves with the tape.It is revealed that the night's events played out due to Leonard's manipulation. Leonard has been deceiving the Boyles by planting fake messages from The Outfit, and knew that Mable has allowed the FBI to place a bug in his store. The recording Violet took was a fake; the real one is still in the store and has been recording the night's conversations, capturing enough information to convict any remaining Boyles as well as LaFontaine. Leonard gives Mable the real tape to send to the FBI and urges her to use LaFontaine's money to live her dreams.Intending to start over again, Leonard douses the store with flammable liquid and lights it with a match, but is interrupted when Francis gets up and tries to kill him. Leonard tells Francis that he used to be a gang enforcer like Francis, but left when he was ordered to commit a heinous crime. Fleeing from his gang, he reinvented himself and started a family, until his old gang found them and burned down his shop, killing his wife and daughter. Leonard fatally stabs Francis in the neck with his prized fabric shears. Wearing a dark jacket to hide his wounds, he quietly leaves the store as it burns."

After Köpernick's drunken behaviour towards the female lead Sheila Sim leads to a fistfight with her husband and co-star Richard Attenborough, Köpernick is killed backstage by an unseen assailant.Inspector Stoppard investigates the murder, shadowed by the inexperienced Constable Stalker. Everyone at the theatre is declared a suspect and a potential victim, including the play's producer Petula Spencer and Woolf's wife Edana Romney. Stoppard attempts to close the theatre until the murder is solved, but the Metropolitan Police Commissioner, Harold Scott, intervenes, assigning Stalker to assist in the investigation.Stoppard and Stalker search Köpernick's room at the Savoy Hotel, finding his address book of women's details. The hotel manager recalls Köpernick's violent argument with screenwriter Mervyn Cocker-Norris, who admits to arguing with Köpernick over the director's vision for an action-packed ending for The Mousetrap film.

Dennis, an usher at the theatre, offers an unhelpful description of a suspicious figure; Attenborough and Sim are questioned as well.

Driving a drunken Stoppard home, Stalker finds news articles and a picture of his ex-wife, fitting Mervyn's description of a ""homely woman with glasses"".

The butler Fellowes is perplexed by their arrival, but Christie's husband, Max Mallowan, allows them inside. The group are held at gunpoint by Dennis, whom Spencer's mother recognises as Dennis Corrigan, an abused child whose brother's death inspired the plot of The Mousetrap. Dennis explains that he killed Köpernick and Mervyn in an attempt to stop the play and its adaptation, disgusted by the exploitation of his brother's tragedy for entertainment.Having forged the invitations to lure everyone together, Dennis has captured Edana, mistaking her for Christie. Christie enters with tea, including a poisoned cup for Dennis which Fellowes inadvertently drinks instead. An armed Stoppard arrives and a shootout ensues; Sim distracts Dennis with a molotov cocktail, and Stalker nearly takes a bullet to save Stoppard, matching Köpernick's story pitch, before Agatha dispatches Dennis with a shovel.

Where they are loud, selfish and unkind she is a quiet observer, thinking up small and cheeky acts of rebellion and revenge. On meeting her inspirational teacher, Miss Honey (Lashana Lynch), Matilda is encouraged and begins conjuring her own fantastical tales. Excited to attend Crunchem Hall, Matilda is surprised to find the school is an ominous and oppressive place led by the huge and villainous Miss Trunchbull (Emma Thompson). As well as kind Miss Honey, the bright lights among the meanness are story-loving librarian, Mrs. Phelps (Sindhu Vee), and Matilda's newfound school friends. Filled with an overwhelming sense of justice, Matilda dares to take a stand for what is right and teach Trunchbull a lesson she won't forget. Roald Dahl's Matilda the Musical is an inspirational musical tale of an extraordinary girl who discovers her superpower and summons the remarkable courage, against all odds, to help others change their stories, whilst also taking charge of her own destiny. Standing up for what's right, she's met with miraculous results. Directed by Tony Award-winning director Matthew Warchus (Matilda The Musical), the film is produced by Eric Fellner and Tim Bevan for Working Title, Jon Finn (Billy Elliot), and Luke Kelly of The Roald Dahl Story Company. Screenwriter Dennis Kelly adapts the Royal Shakespeare Company's production for the big screen, with original music and lyrics by Tim Minchin.—Netflix While other parents adore their newborn children, Mrs Wormwood is distraught to learn she is pregnant and in labour. To Mr Wormwood's confusion, she has a girl, Matilda. Despite her parents' disdain, Matilda grows into a sweet child who loves reading books and visits Mrs Phelps, the librarian, every day. Upon discovering that Matilda has not been properly schooled, Miss Jennifer Honey and an inspector visit the house to suggest Matilda be sent to Crunchem Hall. Angry at being fined for not enrolling Matilda on time, Mr Wormwood falsely claims to the headmistress, Miss Agatha Trunchbull, that Matilda is a troublemaker. In retaliation, Matilda tricks him into dyeing his hair green.On her way to school, Matilda tells Mrs Phelps her story about an escapologist who falls in love with and marries an acrobat. When the school bell rings, Matilda befriends a new girl named Lavender. They are taught to fear the school and Miss Trunchbull by the prefects. In Miss Honey's class, Matilda solves a complex maths equation on the board and confesses that she loves reading most of all. Miss Honey tries to convince Miss Trunchbull to move Matilda to a more advanced class, but Miss Trunchbull refuses to let Matilda be an exception to the rules.At home, Matilda criticises her father, who furiously rips her library book apart and sends Matilda to her room. In the morning, she glues his hat to his head. At school, Matilda leads the students in protecting Nigel from being wrongfully punished, and Miss Trunchbull throws Amanda Thripp by her pigtail braids over the fence instead. The next day, Miss Trunchbull falsely accuses Matilda of stealing a slice of her private chocolate cake, but Bruce Bogtrotter reveals he is the culprit by belching a chocolatey belch. Miss Trunchbull punishes Bruce by forcing him to eat the entire cake, promising he will be forgiven if he manages it. Furious that he succeeds, Miss Trunchbull condemns him to the Chokey regardless. Matilda attempts to defend him as he is led away. Matilda continues the story for Mrs Phelps: the now-pregnant acrobat was forced to perform a dangerous stunt by her stepsister; the acrobat is horribly injured, and she dies after giving birth to a daughter. The escapologist forgives the stepsister and asks her to help him raise his daughter, but the stepsister secretly bullies her.At home, Mr Wormwood locks Matilda in her room for criticising how he tricks people into buying his cars. Matilda ends her story: the aunt locks the daughter in the cellar and goes out, and the escapologist comes home early and learns his daughter is mistreated but never returns from confronting the stepsister. Miss Trunchbull forces the children through challenging exercises to crush their rebellious spirit. Lavender slips her pet newt Isaac into Miss Trunchbull's drinking water, and Matilda furiously uses her newly discovered telekinesis to toss Isaac down Miss Trunchbull's shirt. Miss Honey invites Matilda to tea at her cottage. There, Matilda learns that her story is real, the escapologist and the acrobat are Miss Honey's parents, and the evil stepsister is Miss Trunchbull. Matilda leaves the cottage and uses her powers to destroy the Chokey. At home, Matilda discovers that her father unwittingly scammed members of the mafia, and the family must flee to Spain. Matilda cries in her room about never seeing Miss Honey, Mrs Phelps and Lavender again.When the children arrive at school, Miss Trunchbull forces them to spell words correctly or be locked in a new Chokey. She has Lavender spell a made-up word, tricking the other children into rebelliously spelling words incorrectly on purpose so that she can lock them all into Chokeys. However, Matilda uses her telekinesis to pretend to be the vengeful ghost of Magnus Honey, Miss Honey's father. She uses him to destroy all her new chokeys, then grabs her by her now pigtailed hair and launches her out of the school, just as Trunchbull did with Thripp. Miss Honey tells Miss Trunchbull never to return and takes back the keys to her father's house. The children celebrate their freedom, destroying Trunchbull's statue in the process. When Mr and Mrs Wormwood come to take Matilda to Spain, Miss Honey begs them to let Matilda stay with her. They allow Matilda to be adopted by Miss Honey, and Matilda uses her powers to unglue her father's hat. With Miss Honey as the new headmistress, the children rename the school The Big Friendly School. Mrs Phelps is overjoyed that Matilda's true story has a happy ending and that Matilda and Miss Honey live happily together."

He finds the recording of Davana threatening Ellis, but is told by the district attorney that the tape is not enough to prosecute. Vincent is told to take some time off. Soon after, Marquez kills Davana by slitting her throat; Vincent and Linda see the news report of her death at a bar. Vincent realizes that Linda took him out to give him an alibi.

Sarah/Karen Gillanhas a mom she avoids and a long distance relationship with Peter. After coughing up blood in her sleep and again at the hospital while waiting to see a doctor, she has tests taken. She's later told that it's an incurable terminal disease - despite feeling fine. As a dying patient, she's offered replacement/cloning. Sarah has a double made at the replacement center as the longer the double spends with Sarah before dying, the more the double will be like Sarah. After 10 months, Sarah's still feeling fine. The doctor tells her that she's had a remission. What about the double? Sarah's problem is that both her boyfriend Peter and her mom get much better along with the double than with Sarah. The law says that there can be only one - and it's decided by a duel to the death. It's time for combat training.—Scott Filtenborg In the near future, Sarah is a depressed alcoholic in a lackluster relationship with her boyfriend Peter and generally disconnected from her pestering mother. One day, Sarah awakens to find a pool of blood in her bed and later learns she is terminally ill, and is told that she will die with certainty. The doctor admits to a 2% margin of error, but insists that Sarah's death is certain. To save those she cares about from the pain of losing her, Sarah opts for a cloning procedure of herself to take her place.Sarah dubs her clone ""Sarah's Double"" and gives her the basic knowledge of her interests and lifestyle.

Outside, the two bond and agree to escape past the border to live their lives. The next morning, the two hike through a forest where Sarah discovers that Sarah's Double has poisoned her water.Sarah's Double eventually shows up late to the duel alone, lying that she is the original and stating that the ""clone"" has fled. After an investigation and a court hearing, a judge declares her to be the original, freeing her to take over as the only Sarah.

White Noise,2022,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6160448/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Dramatizes a contemporary American family's attempts to deal with the mundane conflicts of everyday life while grappling with the universal mysteries of love, death, and the possibility of happiness in an uncertain world. At once hilarious and horrifying, lyrical and absurd, ordinary and apocalyptic, ""White Noise"" dramatizes a contemporary American family's attempts to deal with the mundane conflicts of everyday life while grappling with the universal mysteries of love, death, and the possibility of happiness in an uncertain world. Ohio, 1984. Without a doubt, Jack Gladney, a liberal arts professor with a strange area of expertise, and his fourth wife, Babette, share a profound, unhealthy preoccupation with death. As a result, when the looming threat of an airborne toxic event forces everyone to evacuate their homes, the mystery of death evolves into sheer existential dread. Of course, this unforeseen complication uproots Jack and Babette's lives--there is no guarantee of ever returning, no knowledge of the extent of the crisis, and no means of protecting themselves from the dangers they may face. Now, nothing will ever be the same again, including the family's brief visits to the local supermarket. And as the sudden displacement and uncertainty create an overwhelming sense of fear and anxiety, the community is closer to the Apocalypse than ever. Can Jack pluck up the courage to face the circus called life, uncomfortable truths, and the inescapable reality of death?—Nick Riganas In 1984, Jack Gladney (Adam Driver) is a professor of ""Hitler studies"" (a field he founded) at the College-on-the-Hill in Ohio. Despite his specialism, he speaks no German and is secretly taking basic lessons to prepare for a speech he is due to give at a conference.
Jack is married to Babette (Greta Gerwig), his fourth wife. Together, they raise a blended family with four children: Heinrich (Sam Nivola) and Steffie (May Nivola), from two of Jack's previous marriages; Denise (Raffey Cassidy), from Babette's previous marriage; and Wilder (Henry and Dean Moore), a child they conceived together. Theirs is a normal life, and Babette worries what life would be when the kids grow up and move away.Denise spies on Babette and finds her secret prescription stash of Dylar, a mysterious drug not in the usual records. Jack experiences a dream about a mysterious man trying to kill him, alluding to an earlier conversation with Babette focused on their mutual fear of death. Jack's colleague, Murray Siskind (Don Cheadle), a professor of American culture, wishes to develop a similarly niche field, ""Elvis studies,"" and convinces Jack to help him to establish his course as the main authority on Elvis on campus. Jack goes to Murray's class and they both engage in a debate on how Elvis and Hitler had remarkably similar childhoods (They both were remarkably close to their mothers, and remained close to them during their old age. Both mesmerized crowds). They briefly become rivals as competition between their courses arises.
Babette is starting to lose her memory. Denise told Steffie that Babette is taking some drugs, that might be contributing to her memory loss. Denise tells Jack that Babette is taking Dylar pills.However, their lives are disrupted when a cataclysmic train accident casts a cloud of chemical waste over the town. Jack is very sure that the cloud poses no threat to the city, and tries to calm his family down, initially. He says that society is set up in a way that the poor and the uneducated pay the highest price for man-made disasters. He reckons he and his family are not ""exposed"". This ""Airborne Toxic Event"" (the event was upgraded from ""feathery plume"" to ""Dark billowing Cloud"" to ""Airborne toxic event"" on the radio in short duration) forces a massive evacuation as a cloud of deadly chemicals (Nyodene D) moves towards the town, which leads to a major traffic jam on the highway. As they are on the highway, there are recommendations on the radio that people should remain indoors, and if have already evacuated, they should find shelter quickly. The progress on the highway is slow due to multiple accidents along the way. The car is soon running out of gas.
Jack drives to a gas station to refill his car, where he is inadvertently exposed to the cloud. soon, the airborne toxic event, becomes a huge cloud of smoke, that brings its own weather and thunder and covers the entire town and surrounding highways.
The family and numerous others are forced into quarantine at a summer camp. Jack's daughter Denise tells him that he got exposed to the cloud at the gas station for 2.5 mins. He goes to report himself to the medical desk, where he is told to continue his life. The exposure is real, but the side effects of the exposure will only be known in the next 15 yrs, as the chemical has a life of 30 yrs.
Murray supplies Jack with a small palm-sized pistol to protect himself against the more dangerous survivalists in the camp. One day, chaos ensues when multiple families desperately try to escape the camp (after a panic is created that the toxic cloud is now headed their way). The Gladneys almost make it out but ultimately end up with their car floating in the river (they follow a Land Rover, who has 4 wheel drive and decides to escape through a forested route, that the Gladneys station wagon cannot handle).
They later arrive in Iron City, where they encounter a man who rants about the lack of media attention on the evacuees and spots Jack, claiming he had seen him before looking at him. After nine days, the family manages to return home. However, since Jack was briefly exposed to the chemical waste, his fear of death becomes exacerbated.Later, everything has returned to normal except for Babette, who has become pale, lethargic and emotionally distant from Jack and the rest of the family (she wears her sweatsuit all the time, stares out of the window and cries all the time).
Soon afterward, Jack begins having hallucinations of a mysterious, balding man following him around. Denise shares her concerns regarding Dylar (and how they are effecting Babette) and Jack confronts Babette (Jack talks to her doctor first, but he denies any knowledge of Dylar or having prescribed it to Babette.. Jack investigates further and asks her university Neuro-chemistry professor for an analysis of the drug.. She tells Jack that the drug is a psycho-pharmaceutical.. but the drug itself is not on the market and it is not known what it does). She admits to having joined (by responding to a newspaper ad) a shadowy clinical trial for a drug (super secret and super experimental drug) to treat death anxieties, and when she was cut from the trial, agreed to having sex with ""Mr. Gray"" in exchange for a continuing supply of the drug. This went on continuously for a few months. The sex was at a grubby motel where the TV was near the ceiling.Intrigued by the idea, Jack asks Denise for the Dylar bottle, but she reveals she threw it away earlier. While digging through the garbage, Jack finds a newspaper ad for Dylar, prompting him to retrieve his pistol and get revenge on Mr. Gray. Jack tracks him down at a motel, where he discovers that Mr. Gray was the man in his hallucinations. Jack shoots him and places the gun in his hand so as to make it look like suicide. Babette unexpectedly shows up and sees a still-alive Mr. Gray, who manages to shoot them both but only injures them slightly. After Jack and Babette convince the confused Mr. Gray that he is responsible for their injuries, they take him to a nearby hospital run by German atheist nuns. There, the couple also reconcile with each other.The next day, the Gladneys shop at an A&P supermarket, where the family participates in a dance number with all the other patrons and employees."

Enola Holmes 2,2022,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14641788/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Now a detective-for-hire, Enola Holmes takes on her first official case to find a missing girl as the sparks of a dangerous conspiracy ignite a mystery that requires the help of friends - and Sherlock himself - to unravel. Fresh off the triumph of solving her first case, Enola Holmes (Millie Bobby Brown) follows in the footsteps of her famous brother, Sherlock (Henry Cavill), and opens her own agency - only to find that life as a female detective-for-hire isn't as easy as it seems. Resigned to accepting the cold realities of adulthood, she is about to close shop when a penniless matchstick girl offers Enola her first official job: to find her missing sister. But this case proves to be far more puzzling than expected, as Enola is thrown into a dangerous new world - from London's sinister factories and colorful music halls, to the highest echelons of society and 221B Baker Street itself. As the sparks of a deadly conspiracy ignite, Enola must call upon the help of friends - and Sherlock himself - to unravel her mystery. The game, it seems, has found its feet again.—Netflix Now established as a detective for hire, Enola Holmes begins running her own detective agency. Just as she's about to lock up and return home, a young girl approaches her to investigate the disappearance of the latter's sister. What follows is that Enola discovers that the disappearance may be connected to a deadly conspiracy. Knowing that this mystery is too big to solve alone, Enola must turn to her brother Sherlock and old friend Tewksbury for help to crack the case.—Blazer346 Enola Holmes sprints through the crowded streets of Victorian London, pursued by two police officers. As they manage to corner her in a back alley, Enola addresses the audience to explain the situation.We flashback to some time earlier. Having solved the case of the disappearance and attempted murder of Lord Tewkesbury of Basilweather, Enola makes arrangements to start her own detective agency. She rents a small space in London, sends out advertisements in the papers, and is fully equipped to begin. However, none her of potential clients are interested in having a young girl take their cases, and the Tewkesbury disappearance is commonly thought to have been solved by Enola's elder brother, the ever-famous Sherlock Holmes. Sherlock himself, although on a constant streak of cracked cases, has allegedly been stumped recently by a brilliant string of crimes. Enola's mother, Eudoria Holmes, has been making her own trouble, dropping small, relatively harmless explosives into mail pillars packed with fliers to promote women's suffrage, as well as other protest activities. Meanwhile, Tewkesbury has established himself in the House of Lords as a voice for positive change, and has gained popularity among both the government and the people as a champion of reform. He has also been writing to Enola, who clearly has lingering feelings for the young lord, but recalling her mother's old lessons to find her own path and reject what society would put to her, she decides to ignore his letters. As the months drag on, Enola's business seems to have proven a failure. She finishes packing her things to move out, but her agency is entered by her first real client; a ten-year-old match girl named Bessie. She followed one of Enola's old advertisements stating she specializes in finding missing persons, and has come to ask her to locate her sister.Bessie takes Enola to her tenement in the slums, where she and her sister, Sarah, live in a small room in the building that houses all of the local match girls. She describes Sarah as an older girl, pretty, with red hair. Noting the lack of resemblance, Bessie and Sarah's friend, Mae, tells Enola that the two were found sisters, and Sarah took the younger girl in. Enola investigates the room, finding several potted plants, some of which have died, science books, as well as a small collection of makeup, unusual for a single girl of her status. She also finds that Sarah liked to leave cheese out for the rats, Bessie claiming she's soft on them. As Enola looks around, she spots a partially burned paper, the only remaining fragment reading ""12 March"". Mae does not want Enola to investigate, and tries to get her to leave, but Bessie insists on hiring the lady detective. Bessie tells Enola she last saw Sarah a week prior at the match factory, having a fight with the Foreman, who claimed she had stolen something from his office. The only thing she left behind for Bessie was the meager money Sarah had earned from her two jobs; the match factory, and washing glasses at a pub. Bessie tries to give Enola the money, but Enola refuses to take any payment until she has solved the mystery, and agrees to take the case.
Bessie takes Enola, in disguise, to Lyon's Match Factory with her with the rest of the working girls. As the enter, Enola giving a fake name, the foreman, Mr. Crouch, checks them for signs of typhus, which has broken out among the girls working at the factory. Bessie shows Enola Sarah's workstation, and the detective sees that the girls' wages are docked for any mistakes. She sneaks into Crouch's office, and finds and old pack of matches dipped in red phosphorus, unlike the white they are currently using. She also breaks into the safe and finds a thread of red hair in a ledger, where several pages have been torn out. She hides upon hearing Mr. Lyon, the owner of the company, and his son William having a meeting with another wealthy man and his assistant regarding the ""theft"". As they leave, narrowly missing Enola herself, Lyon takes the other man, Lord McIntyre, on a tour of his factory, showing off his hard working ladies, many of whom know someone who is dying or has died from typhus over the past two years as it's swept through the match girls. At the end of the day, Enola deduces from Bessie that Mae helped Sarah sneak into Crouch's office before by starting a fire at her station, and decides to follow her that evening.Mae, despite her efforts to not be followed, leads Enola to a theater downtown, The Paragon. A young woman swings to the stage on a trapeze, and Enola recognizes Mae with the other dancers. After the performance, Enola goes backstage and is confronted by Mae with a knife, and warns her that a ""posh"" girl like her should not be involved. After demonstrating her abilities by turning the tables and pinning Mae, Enola demands to know what was in the pages Sarah stole from Lyon, having already deduced from the makeup in her apartment that Sarah and Mae both performed at the theater, and lied about it to Bessie. Sarah is called back to stage, and she reveals it was only a prop knife. Enola bribes the stage manager to show her Sarah's makeup station. He tells her that Sarah had an admirer, a gentile man that sene her flowers and letters, and Sarah was keen on him. Enola finds one of the hidden letters, containing a poem thats signed with what looks like a poppy. She begins to suspect that Sarah may have run away with, or is running away from, a lover. As she makes her way back, Enola realizes she is being followed by a man with using a cane with a metal tip. She evades him, and runs into Sherlock, who has just been thrown out of a pub. They are surprised to see eachother, and Sherlock is heavily inebriated, which he excuses as being a part of his latest case. Enola helps her brother back to his home at 221B Baker Street, and is awed to finally be inside the famous, if extremely messy, apartment. Sherlock tells her not to touch anything, before passing out, and she decides to look around. She finds evidence of his current case, a tangled web of a map displaying dozens of connected crimes.The next morning, Sherlock is most displeased to see she has moved several of his papers, and asks her to leave. She suggests that he get a flatmate to prevent him from descending into the level of disorder and drunkenness in which he has recently found himself. While they argue, Sherlock deduces that she has worked in a match factory based on her appearance, as well as her general state, and, noting the mark on her neck from Mae's ""knife"", asks if she is in danger. He tells her not to get herself into trouble to prove herself, and says that his offer for her to become his ward is still open. Insisting that she does not need his approval or help, Enola leaves. She goes to the park fuming, but is interrupted by the arrival of Tewkesbury, on his daily walk to the House of Lords. They awkwardly share pleasantries, Enola complimenting him on his work, and noting that is now considered quite an eligible bachelor by the society papers, though he tells her not to believe it. He says he has seen her in this park every so often on his way to the Lords, and she brushes it off saying that she likes to enjoy her breakfast there sometimes. When asked why she did not reply to his letters, she says she was merely busy starting her business. He offers to help financially if she needs it, but she refuses. Tewkesbury tells her she knows where to find him, and continues on his way. Enola relaxes, and tells the audience that she does not, in fact, come to the park all the time when Tewkesbury is on his commute, though she accidentally reveals that she knows all his usual routes. Suddenly inspired, Enola looks over the poem from Sarah's lover, and finds a coded address in the words. Following it, she discovers a flat, the door forced open. Going upstairs, she finds the apartment in ruins, containing evidence of a red-headed woman and a gentleman having lived there. Looking around, she finds Mae on the bed with a knife lodged in her stomach, barely alive. Enola tries to stabilize her, but the young woman bleeds out. Shocked, Enola gathers her senses and realizes that Mae indicated her pocket before she died, and discovers a piece of sheet music titled ""The Truth of the Gods"". Inspector Lestrade enters, followed soon after by his superior, Superintendent Grail, who's cane makes the same clanging sound Enola heard following her the previous night. Grail and Lestrade start to suspect Enola murdered Mae after finding blood on her hands and the evidence she tried to hide. Not trusting Grail, Enola runs from the police and manages to make it back to Sherlock's flat before Lestrade comes to inquire about her whereabouts. Sherlock successfully hides her, and afterwards the siblings trade case details. The elder Holmes explains that a series of masterful financial thefts have occurred all over London and are being siphoned into a single account that is so far untraceable, and whoever is behind it is a genius that is clearly enjoying themselves. The only clue he has is a vague description of a man stealing a document from the treasury office. Holmes strictly instructs Enola to hide in his flat while he goes out to investigate. While he is gone, Enola does research, and finds an article about and imminent ball being held by Mr. Lyon to combat typhus amongst the match makers. Recalling her conversation with Tewkesbury, she realizes that the flower on Sarah's note is not a poppy, but in fact a Sweet William, as in Mr. Lyon's son William Lyon, and decides to infiltrate the ball.Enola successfully makes it into the party, but is not allowed to speak with William without a chaperone. Frustrated, she is approached by Lord McIntyre's personal assistant, Mira Troy, who offers her a fan, which can be used to speak secret languages. The only way she might get close to Lyon's heir without an escort is by dancing, which Enola was never taught by her renegade mother. Enola spots Tewksbury, takes him into a bathroom, and demands an impromptu dance lesson from the bewildered lord. He reluctantly agrees when she tells him a girl's life may be in the balance, and as they make their way through the steps, they express their mutual concern for eachother's safety, since he has noticed her keeping tabs on him for months. Enola picks up the dance, and they grow closer together, but are interrupted by a knock on the door. Tewkesbury gives Enola a dance card and exits via the window, leaving Enola with a fan flourish who's meaning he promises she will eventually learn. Enola is able to get William to sign her dance card, and his writing matches the note, confirming he was indeed Sarah's lover. Another woman at the ball, Lady Cicely, approaches Tewkesbury, to Enola's annoyance.Meanwhile, Sherlock has finally deciphered his own puzzle, using a book of dances as the key. He parcels out only a message congratulating him, signed with a name: Moriarty. The ball guests begin the next dance, and Enola takes the opportunity to speak with William about Sarah, suspecting he only feigned affection for her in order to do her harm. He becomes scared when she speaks of this, revealing he knows Sarah's sister Bessie, and begs her to leave it be, for both of their safety. Enola refuses, so he tells her to meet him later to explain. When she does, she finds Tewkesbury there, trying to look after her, and they argue, Enola assuming that Tewkesbury's interests lay solely in finding a wife amongst his plentiful admirers. William recognizes Tewkesbury when he arrives, however, they do not have time to talk, as the police enter and arrest Enola. She slips Tewkesbury her evidence before she is taken away to Scotland Yard, and is questioned by Grail. Enola deduces that he has been following her and Mae, on behalf of someone else. He demands to know where Sarah is, but Enola doesn't yet know. He threatens to find out from Bessie instead.Sherlock is told about Enola's arrest, and goes to the station to have her freed. Grail refuses, despite Sherlock's deductions from the apartment crime scene suggesting it was in fact Grail and his personal officers that murdered Mae while looking for Sarah. Grail has a cutting edge piece of technology that proves Enola guilty; her fingerprints on the knife. Sherlock knows this to be impossible, since his sister never touched the weapon, and so he goes to ask his mother's friend and Judo instructor Edith for help. The next day, Enola is taken to prison where she is liberated by Eudoria and Edith, who whisk her away in a carriage. The hasty mother-daughter reunion is secondary to keeping the pursuing officers at bay using smoke bombs, and Enola explains to Eudoria the case so far. Mrs. Holmes gives her some advice right before Grail manages to derail their carriage. The three women defend themselves handily before escaping under the cover of one final explosion. Eudoria advises Enola to use the resources and allies at her disposal to help her solve the case, and mentions that Tewkesbury, with his moral crusading, has earned her unambiguous approval, before leaving again.Enola returns to London to find Bessie, and send her to stay somewhere else for her safety. Taking another look around the tiny flat, she notices red and white match heads sprinkled in the plants and on the cheese Sarah was feeding to the rats, noting that everything that has touched the white phosphorus is dead, while the more expensive red phosphorus is not nearly as volatile. Sh recalls more such experiments from the ""love nest"" in town, and the pieces come together. The white phosphorus that the match factory has been using for the past two years is toxic, and is killing the girls. To cover it up, the factory owners are blaming it on typhus. And Sarah has proof. Enola finds Tewkesbury, and asks him for his help, and to apologize for dismissing him earlier. Tewkesbury tries to assure her he has no time or interest in finding a wife, since he is kept far too busy with politics to think about anything else. Enola encourages him, and fills him in on the case. He offers any help he can give. They are once again interrupted by a knock, and Enola hides while Tewkesbury answers to find the woman from earlier, Cicely, who says she must speak with him on an urgent matter. He promises to talk later and she leaves. Worried what Enola might think, he explains that she came to confide in him about a conspiracy to do with factory laws. He tries to put his feelings for Enola into words, but she is too distracted by her thoughts to listen. She figures out that all this time, Cicely, who also went to the ball without a chaperone, is in fact Sarah Chapman in disguise. She runs outside to try and catch up, but Sarah is gone. Tewkesbury frustratedly follows, and asks if she heard anything he was saying. She did, and asks him what the fan flourish he gave her at the ball meant. He admits it meant 'I love you.' Enola remembers Cicely/Sarah giving William the same flourish at the ball, and realizes that they actually were deeply in love, working together with Mae to expose William's own father. The invited Tewkesbury to the ball because he is the only man in government they could trust to help them. Enola admits that she loves Tewkesbury as well, and asks him to help her finish the case. They go to the match factory and sneak in, where Enola runs into Sherlock, the epicenter of his case also being Lyon's Match Factory. They find William dead upstairs, seemingly killed under questioning. They discover a scrap of sheet music in his hand, matching the one Enola found on Mae, ""The Truth of the Gods"". Tewkesbury suggests that ""The Gods"" could be a reference to the upper balcony of a theater, and they rush to the Paragon. On the way, Tewkesbury asks Enola to trade his dance lesson for a fight lesson from her. She teaches him the basics, and they share a first kiss. When they make it to the theater, Sarah is there to meet them, the documents she and William stole proving Lord McIntyre and Henry Lyon conspired to hide the true cause of death among the match girls, among other evidence, hidden under the seats in the balcony. The others tell her William has been killed, but there is no time to mourn, as Grail and his men arrive with Bessie held hostage to demand the papers. Bessie fights back and gets away, and the group scatters. Enola swings on the trapeze to the stage below, but is cut off from the exit. Grail pulls a gun and shoots Sherlock in the shoulder before pursuing Enola upstairs, meanwhile Tewkesbury waylays Sargent Beeston, Grail's burly officer, but is hopelessly outmatched against the policeman hand to hand. Sherlock takes on the final two men, throwing Tewkesbury his cane sword to even the odds. Enola plays cat and mouse with Grail to make him waste his bullets, and she succeeds in protecting Sarah and Bessie by luring Grail onto the suspended catwalks high above the stage. Grail grabs a knife from the dressing rooms and follows Enola, who runs to a dead end before a long drop. Grail stabs Enola with the knife, which distracts Tewkesbury long enough for Beeston to disarm and subdue him. However, the knife was Mae's retractable prop knife, and Enola turns the tables on Grail. He uses an iron hook on a rope as an improvised weapon, which hits Enola causing a head injury, and he takes the papers from her. Once again using her knowledge on cause and effect, she jumps from the catwalk, grabbing a rope that pulls the hook Grail was using. The hook snags on Grail, first crushing him against the ceiling, then dropping him to the floor. Meanwhile, Tewkesbury summons all his remaining strength to deliver a single, powerful blow to Beeston while his guard is down, dropping the officer in one hit. Sherlock also manages to neutralize the other two men, and the group reunites. Lastrade arrives with more officers to take away Grail and his paid off men, having been summoned by Sherlock earlier, and proving Enola's innocence. Lord McIntyre also arrives with Miss Troy, summoned by Lastrade. McIntyre demands Sarah be arrested for theft and blackmail, but Sarah never blackmailed McIntyre or Lyon. Sherlock's mysterious new foe has, someone fond of mind games and close enough to take advantage of the situation caused by Sarah, Mae, and William: Mira Troy, AKA Moriarty. She was the one paying Grail and his men to find Sarah, and under her orders they interrogated both Mae and William, who died rather than give her up. She blames Grail's blunt methods for their deaths, but nevertheless she found it thrilling to play the game. Moriarty applauds both Sherlock and Enola for their work, saying they must play again, and is arrested. However, Lord McIntyre takes the papers and burns them, erasing the evidence of his effective murder of hundreds of match girls, which devastates Sarah.Several days pass, and Enola meets with Sarah and Bessie, who tell her that without evidence, the match factories will stay in operation without consequence. Enola goes with them to the factory for one last option, and they tell the girls their only option is to stand up for themselves and leave the factory until the toxic white phosphorus is removed. Afraid of losing precious income, they are hesitant, but eventually stand together and leave the factory en mass.Some time later, Sherlock goes to see Enola, who has reopened her detective agency out of Edith's upper office, and shows her a newspaper article. Tewkesbury has used his influence to testify against Lord McIntyre, who has been arrested. He also offers to take her in as his ward and apprentice at Baker Street. While flattered and grateful, she declines, preferring to stay close to the working people and let Sherlock handle the high-profile cases. She does however tell him that he should find a companion to help him and ease his loneliness. They promise to check on eachother from time to time, and make plans to meet soon. Tewkesbury arrives to take Enola on a date, and Sherlock thanks Edith for her help, before reading in the paper that Moriarty has escaped police custody. Enola and Tewkesbury walk through London and Tewkesbury tells her he got them an invitation to a ball. Given her experiences at her last ball, she suggests finding an alternative.A few days later at the scheduled time, Sherlock opens his door to find not his sister, but a Doctor Watson, who was told he was looking for a flatmate. Realizing Enola's ruse, he shows the man in."

After breaking into Anna's house and killing her, Leena looks up missing American girls and finds that she bears a striking resemblance to Esther Albright, a girl from a rich family went missing in 2003. Later, posing as a lost girl, Leena is approached by a Russian police officer and introduces herself as ""Esther"", claiming that her parents are in the United States.In Darien, Connecticut, wealthy artist Allen Albright and his wife Tricia, who has since come to terms with the disappearance of their daughter, are informed by Detective Donnan that ""Esther"" has been found. Tricia travels to the U.S. embassy in Moscow where she is ""reunited"" with Esther. Tricia brings Esther home and immediately starts to have doubts when she notices that Esther has forgotten about the death of her grandmother or that her painting skills have increased enormously compared to before she disappeared. Leena falls in love with Allen after they both start bonding over their painting skills, and tries to separate him from Tricia.While Tricia and Allen attend a charity gala hosted by Tricia, Donnan arrives at the house and steals a vinyl record from Esther's room which has Leena's fingerprints on it. He takes it back to his house, unaware that Leena has followed him, and analyzes the fingerprints to find it is not a match. Leena attacks Donnan and stabs him with a knife repeatedly, before Tricia arrives, having followed Leena. Instead of stopping Leena, Tricia opens fire on Donnan with a gun and kills him. Tricia reveals that she knows Leena is not Esther, who died four years earlier during an altercation with her older brother Gunnar, which Tricia covered up without Allen's knowledge. Tricia explains that she is only welcoming Leena to make Allen happy again, as he was devastated by Esther's disappearance. Leena reveals her true identity to Tricia, and the two then dispose of Donnan's body in a cellar hatch where the real Esther is buried and frame his disappearance as a vacation trip by forging an email to the police station.Knowing that it would be too suspicious if ""Esther"" were to disappear again, Tricia and Gunnar agree to continue Leena's act for Allen's sake, and Leena and Tricia remain on guard with each other.

Tricia tries to stage a suicide, but Leena fights back and flees before Gunnar throws her down the stairs.

Do Revenge,2022,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt13327038/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Drea and Eleanor agree to go after one another's bullies.

Eleanor is an awkward new transfer student who is angered to find out that she now has to go to school with her old bully, Carissa who started a nasty rumor about her in summer camp when they were 13. After a clandestine run-in at tennis camp, Drea and Eleanor form an unlikely and secret friendship to get revenge on each other's tormentors. Drea has the perfect boyfriend - Rosehill's golden boy, and is even besties with the elite groups of the school. She is also an A-grade student, which makes her worthy of the perfect future with a scholarship at Yale followed by a secured life as a Howard law graduate. However, her efforts of 17 years of meticulously planning her life go for a toss when her boyfriend leaks her topless video.At the same time, Eleanor, a shy girl with past trauma of her own, joins the Tennis club where Drea is spending her behavioral-probation time. After learning about each other's trauma-stricken experiences, both plan for a sinister revenge game that changes everything in the coming season of school time.
The devastating experience in school makes Drea understand that being vulnerable in front of people will not do her any good. She learns her lesson the hard way and as her headmaster advises her; tries to process her anger in a better way than punching the school's golden boy.
We are also introduced to the second lead of the film - Eleanor. While overspeeding her car showing her rebellious personality, she talks to her mother over the call, who is delighted about her daughter's decision to join the tennis club. Although her mother pushes her to make new friends at the club, Eleanor is happy just being friends with her pet lizard - Oscar Winner Olivia Colman.
Sun basking and reading Patricia Highsmith's Strangers on a Train (the screenplay of the film is inspired by the book's film adaptation by Hitchcock) on the side field of a tennis court, Eleanor notices Drea impairing the new joiner's determination to play. The uncrushed spirit of Drea makes Eleanor instantly realize they will be best friends one day.
I think teenage girls are eviler than adolescent boys. They wouldn't even think twice about hurting people back if someone hurt them. The film at this point makes sure we know this and learn from it. Eleanor understands how to get Drea's attention; hence, she tells her that Erica showed everyone the leaked video. And just like how the stars would have it, Erica's life is upside down when she is arrested for possessing drugs.While bidding goodbye to Erica for rehab, Drea makes sure everyone knows what she can do if someone dares to demean her. Later, when her car gets broken, Eleanor offers her a lift. And even though she is initially reluctant to engage with her, she agrees to tag along. We then learn that Eleanor was defamed for being a predator to young girls after she tried to come out to a girl she liked in her school.Bonding after learning about each other's past and realizing they have nothing else to lose - the girls become good friends. In the meantime, school reopens, resuming the extravagant life of the Rosehill students.On one side, Eleanor meets Gabi, who introduces her to nincompoops and elite groups of people from a distance. At the same time, Drea's return surprises her best friend, Tara - who forgot about her after the scandalous event. Max, on the other hand, continues to be a prick to Drea as he embarrasses her in front of the whole school by publicly apologizing for the misfortune she had to go through.Even though Drea had been putting on a lovely façade of keeping her chin up the whole time, when Max tried to break her esteem like that, she finally breaks down. To avoid people's hollowness and terrible sympathies, Drea corners herself in the school washroom, which is her favorite spot. Eleanor follows her and tries to express that she is there for her. However, Drea just wouldn't let anyone take undue advantage of her feelings.When Eleanor shares her brief encounter with the girl who ruined her preteen life, Drea understands that both of them are going through somewhat similar turmoil. Because they have to endure the ordeal of all the shame, unwanted guilt, and pity of all these people who don't value them for their truer selves, they start manifesting verbal desire to hurt them. Drea's mastermind soon picks up a hint from her conversation with Eleanor, and both devise a cunning plan to bring the people down who caused them immense pain and cost them their happiness.
Since nobody knows they know each other, Drea proposes Eleonor pretend to play someone very hard to please in order to earn Max's attention. Once he is in her loop, she will automatically get introduced to the group that was once close-knit with Drea. And even though Eleanor's inner closeted personality doesn't allow her to be someone like that, she gives in - because, in return, she gets to take down the girl who defamed her as a kid.Knowing that both of them share an almost Glenn Close in Fatal Attraction energy, or in their term Glenergy, the girls move on with the second & third step to their master plan - a makeover followed by trapping the first rat - Max.Once Eleanor gets Max following her everywhere, she starts behaving the way Drea taught her to - considering the latter knows what intrigues her ex-boyfriend in a girl. When Max invites Eleanor to his annual summer party at his beach house, the girls carefully prep for the next course of action. Drea wants Eleanor to spy on Max while he is busy partying so they can collect evidence on him being the scoundrel that he is in reality.
Drea takes an interest in the gardening program that Carissa is running and soon learns that she is not just growing vegetables in the greenhouse. She tries to closely follow Carissa's moves, in order to learn more about her. While Eleanor is assisting Drea in executing her master plan, the latter has already plotted a revenge strategy for her new friend.While half the school is partying at Max's house, the other group is relaxing at the beach. At this point, Drea is attracted to Carissa's best friend, Rush, who entertains her with genuine love and feelings. Eleanor, on the other hand, finds her way to Max's room and gets her hand on his phone. She looks it up and finds out that he has been cheating on his current girlfriend - Tara, with the internet witch. However, when she is about to take pictures of the chats he exchanged with the girl, Eleanor finds herself hiding from the possible make-out session between Max and Tara.Tara is a considerably sweet girl by heart, and being in a relationship with her ex-best friend's ex-lover keeps haunting her. Hence, she mentions this to Max, but he doesn't genuinely seem to be affected by this. Noticing her new boyfriend's coldness, she immediately rejects him and storms out of the room. Soon, Max notices that Eleanor is hiding in the room, and he asks her to join him at his favorite place in the house. During their conversation, Eleanor effortlessly gets Max to unmask himself and talk about real things he wants to do. Seeing her genuinely take notice of what he has to say, Max gets enchanted by her.
The next day, Eleanor and Drea slide into Rosehill farm to get hold of their next plan - steal shrooms from Carissa's greenhouse and dose everyone at the dinner that the latter has been working on for months. So far, their plans have been coming along perfectly as post-dinner the students started to behave erratically. This alerts the school headmaster who also received an anonymous tip (from Drea) to detain Carissa for growing drugs on the school property.Later that night, when the girls triumph over their evil actions to pin down people who hurt them, Drea suggests looking up everything Max has been doing. When Eleanor hacks his phone, she finds collective data that indicates that he is a big-time liar and attention seeker. This upsets Drea, but she has learned to grow a tough exterior that she doesn't want her friend to see. Eleanor explains that being vulnerable is alright, and she can trust her and live through the experience of her emotions as they come at this moment.
Consequently, Valentine's day is right around the corner, and the school's editorial team has spoken to Max and printed his version of everything that happened after the leaked video. He presented himself in such a way that the entire school now believes that he is, after all, an accidental feminist.On the other hand, while Drea's life is busier with her new form of love connection with Rush, she is soon summoned by the headmaster for her dropped academic performance. She learns this will jeopardize her entry to Yale as they are considering revoking her scholarship.At the same time, after a failed attempt to bury Max's image to the ground, Tara helps plot rumors all around the school that she and Max are in an open relationship. Although it has a crazier response from the entire school, it doesn't go well with Drea, who had imagined a better outcome to her plan. Witnessing how things drastically took turns against her plan, Drea is angrier than ever. She is fuming at how Max continues to win.
Eleanor can see how the rage and hunger for pulling down Max have engulfed Drea's vision and their friendship. And even though she tries to explain it, Drea seems to only be concentrated on strategizing more evil plans. At this point, Eleanor mentions to Drea that it's her birthday the next day; however, Drea ignores it and wants her friend to help her in getting her revenge over anything else.
Taking time off from Drea, Eleanor meets Gabi (Max's sister) and realizes they both have a strong connection. After learning Gabi understands and sees her through, Eleanor admits her fondness for her. Later, Max & Tara throw a surprise birthday bash at Eleanor's house that completely sweeps her off her feet. When Drea discovers this, she decides to crash the party with Rush. It makes things uncomfortable as Max and Tara wonder how these girls know one another.Eleanor takes Drea outside, and both get into a heated argument where Drea reminds her that these people will not take two seconds to throw her out if she revolts against them. Eleanor points out how selfish Drea has been all this while and ignores her, considering they have been dealing with everything together. In a spiff of anger, she also tells Drea that there isn't enough evidence for her to blame Max for leaking her video.
Taken aback by what she heard, Drea leaves and Eleanor realizes that Gabi overheard everything. When she tries to explain, Gabi points out that this is not her real personality and the sooner she realizes the better it will be for her. Later that night, Drea discovers someone removed the spark plug of her car again. She soon realizes that Eleanor is behind all this and has been putting up with a fake story to be her friend all this time.To find out more, Drea meets Carissa at the rehabilitation center to get to the bottom of finding out about Eleanor. After speaking with her, she learns that only Drea teased and spread rumors about Eleanor as a kid. All this time, Eleanor had been framing her so she could take revenge against Drea for ruining her life. Eleanor also leaked Drea's topless video, and all this time, Drea was, after the wrong person and teamed up with a girl that the film now reintroduces as a psychopath.
The film now shows both sides of the story. On one side, we know Drea got bamboozled. And at the same time, Eleanor declares that teenage girls are indeed psychopaths. She still thinks that Drea is the same person who would do anything to be on the top at all times. Eleanor is not guilty of leading her friend's life to hell. Are we sympathizing with the wrong girl here after learning Eleanor's story?In the next moment, we see the two friends-now foes coming face to face with one another. Eleanor (or Nora) explains that she has had the upper hand the entire time because narcissists (Drea, in this case) are too focused on themselves to realize they have been played. There seems no end to the game Nora continues to play with Drea.
She wants Drea to go to the admissions party and push her friends to do the craziest thing they have ever done. Nora plans to leak all this information and pin it on Drea - finally getting her revenge. She also tells Drea that Rush knows everything and leaves.On her way to telling the truth, Drea meets with an accident. Eleanor visits Drea and explains that this accident will help her get back to her friends, who will give her a free pass to the admission party. Later, at the hospital, Rush pushes her to give up everything and come clean to the headmaster. However, the time is not suitable to give up.Then, the big day of the event finally arrives. Drea and Eleanor reach the party with plans of their own. While at the party, Drea starts bullying Eleanor in front of her friends. The two of them move out and discuss that they are both hurting from the bitterness. In a rage, Drea throws the secret camera that Eleanor had asked her to wear so as to record the wrong happenings at the party. However, she also confesses in front of Eleanor that she has had a change of heart and she no longer wants to be this person fighting over things that are in the past.While the girls confront one another with their feelings, Max overhears everything. He tries to blackmail them by threatening to show all the conversations that had with each other over destroying him to everyone at the party. At this point, the film clearly establishes that young boys are plain dumb and the perfect example of narcissists who won't absolve anything that hurts their weak male ego. Thanks, patriarchy!Once Max is through blabbering his agendas and gone, Eleanor shows Drea that she had been recording everything he had said using her backup camera attached to her crop top. Back at the party, while everyone is having a gala time and Max is in the other room, the music stops abruptly. When Max comes out to check what stopped the music, he finds everyone looking at the recordings of his conversation earlier with the girls.
While he tries to explain himself with his continued lies, everyone immediately dismisses him. The girls win and return to their old friendship as everything comes to a full circle."

Brady later meets and befriends Sandra, who invites him into her house while he attempts to rollerskate, much to Dylan's shock and jealousy. Upon Brady's return, Kurt, Mark and Boner compliment him for his newfound relationship with Sandra. When they beg him for information, Brady tells him that Sandra invited him back to help set up a new webcam. Dylan and his friends enlist Brady to follow through on this promise, pressuring him into installing spyware on her computer, intending to hack into her webcam in the hopes of seeing her nude. Brady reluctantly agrees and returns to Sandra's house that night. Although he is nearly caught, he manages to install the spyware, despite being wracked with guilt for spying on Sandra and betraying her trust. Unbothered, Dylan and his friends watch Sandra as she undresses as Brady leaves the room. The boys are horrified to witness Sandra bending her limbs, ripping off her scalp, uncovering hair made of snakes and revealing that she is actually a gorgon. Sandra appears to notice what the boys are doing through the webcam and leaps from her window to their house. One of the friends tries calling the police on Sandra, but she breaks into Dylan's room and attacks them, killing Kurt, Mark, and Boner. As Dylan flees, Brady arrives and attempts to reason with Sandra, apologizing for violating her privacy. Not accepting his apology, Sandra turns Brady to stone, then proceeds to petrify Dylan as well. Now fully transformed, she slowly approaches the camera, stuck in Dylan's stony hand, as the tape comes to an end.""To Hell And Back"":On New Year's Eve 1999, best friends and videographers Nate (Archelaus Cristano) and Troy (Joseph Winter) have been hired by what is revealed to be a coven of witches. Their task is to film the witches performing a ritual where a woman named Kirsten (Tori Pence) volunteers to be offered as a vessel to a powerful demon known as Ukabon (Dustin Watts). Despite agreeing to film the ritual, Nate is notably skeptical of his clients and thinks that the ritual may be a prank. The witches performing the ritual tell the duo that while they call to Ukabon, they will not actually summon it until the stroke of midnight on the new millennium, when the veil between Earth and Hell is at its thinnest. As the ritual begins, Ferkus, an uninvited demon who has disrupted the coven's rituals before, makes its presence known. As the witches attempt to cast it out, Ferkus grabs Nate and Troy and drags them underneath the witches' altar. As his camera glimpses Ferkus retreating, Troy slowly discovers that he and Nate have been sent to Hell. The duo encounter bloodthirsty demons, hazardous traps, and mutilated bodies spread throughout the cavernous landscape, prompting Nate to arm himself with a discarded pitchfork as a means of protection. As they make their way across Hell, Nate and Troy cross paths with Mabel (Melanie Stone), a damned soul who speaks in archaic terms and can tell that they are mortal, thus making them irresistible to hungry demons. She decides to help them escape by leading them to Ukabon, whom she hates, in exchange for the two of them writing her name in the witches' spell book. Nate and Troy also remember how the witches told them that the veil between Earth and Hell is weakest at midnight, and since Ukabon is the only conduit through which the duo can return to Earth, they have only minutes to find them before they are stuck in Hell for eternity. While trekking across Hell, the group encounters more demons, and Nate and Troy bicker with one another constantly over their predicament, confusing Mabel with their modern ways of speaking. Eventually, the group enters a cave where they find Ukabon, surrounded by a cult of masked demons, preparing to enter Kirsten's body. The demon cultists attack the trio, but Nate and Troy manage to kill them. As midnight rapidly approaches, Nate and Troy shout at Mabel to come with them to Earth. She is unfortunately stabbed by one of the cultists, reminding them to write her name in the book. The two friends jump inside Ukabon's cavernous stomach just as the ritual commences. The duo successfully return to Earth, albeit with Nate possessing Kirsten's body. Furious that their ritual has failed, the witches kill Nate and Troy before arguing with one another about what went wrong. A dying Troy uses his blood to write Mabel's name in the book the witches used to summon Ukabon, then succumbs to his injuries before the tape ends.""The Gawkers (Final Frame)"":
The tape returns to the previous segment, showing Dylan and Brady's stone bodies before the camera's battery runs out.As the credits end, the witches can be heard performing their ritual again, this time calling Mabel's name, hinting that she will return to Earth. Then, a final clip of Brady's video shows a soldier spying on enemies, but gets ran over by a tank - presumably Johnson's - and the clip ends."

Gold,2022,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6020800/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"In the not too distant future, a drifter travelling through the desert discovers the largest gold nugget ever found. He must guard it from thieves amid harsh conditions and wild dogs while waiting for his partner to return. Set against the backdrop of a vast, unique and unforgiving landscape, Gold is a taut thriller about greed and the lengths people will go to secure themselves a fortune. When two drifters travelling through the desert stumble across the biggest gold nugget ever found, the dream of immense wealth and greed takes hold. They hatch a plan to protect and excavate their bounty with one man leaving to secure the necessary equipment. The other man remains and must endure the harsh desert climate, preying wolves and intruders, whilst battling the creeping doubt that he has been abandoned to his own fate.—Official Synopsis In the not too distant future, two drifters (Zac Efron, Anthony Hayes) traveling through the desert stumble across the biggest gold nugget ever found and the dream of immense wealth and greed takes hold. They hatch a plan to excavate their bounty with one man leaving to secure the necessary tools. The other man remains and must endure harsh desert elements, ravenous wild dogs, and mysterious intruders, while battling the sinking suspicion that he has been abandoned to his own fate. The film sets its place of unfolding at first, with grainy, dusty desert landscapes with barren trees, and a text on the screen calls it ""some time, someplace, not far from now."" An unnamed man, played by Zac Efron (and therefore will be referred to by the actor's name as the characters in the film remain unnamed), is seen traveling in a goods train compartment, eating away a piece of bread. At the other end of the compartment is a woman and her baby, both hungrily looking at the food. This seems to warm Efron's heart, and he offers the rest of the bread to her before getting down at his station. The place is a run-down outpost but seemingly serves as a connection point to an area called The Compound, where Efron's character plans to go. He asks around for a man who is supposed to drive him to the place, but the attendant at the outpost is as inhospitable as the barren desert all around. As he relieves himself in a dirty makeshift washroom, the second man, played by Anthony Hayes, arrives at the place. The two quickly set out on their journey towards The Compound, and the Hayes character seems to be opportunistic from the very beginning, as he charges extra money from the other man for gas and water. After they enter the desert and drive through barren, inhabitable landscapes, Hayes' car breaks down with a puncture, and they have to stop. Efron helps out with the problem, as he fixes the puncture and witnesses a facet of the harsh reality of the area when a wild dog attacks and tries to kill another for food. Hayes intervenes in such a cannibalistic act and perhaps does the humane thing as he kills the injured dog, relieving it of its pains.Soon the two are on the move again, and when they stop for rest that night, Efron discloses why he is going to The Compound. He shows his companion an advertisement pamphlet that offers a great life to those moving to The Compound. As Hayes seems to be more accustomed to the place than the other younger man, he warns Efron of the most misleading advertisements that big corporations nowadays put out to attract cheap labor. The next day they continue their drive again, but trouble strikes when the car breaks down from overheating because Efron increased the air-con. As the two men try to find a solution to their immediate problem, Efron suddenly discovers a chunk of shiny rock sticking out from the ground. Moving away from the loose sand covering the rock, he calls Hayes over to take a look, and their tests confirm that they have found a huge gold nugget stuck in the ground in the middle of the desert. At first, they try to get the rock out with their hands and by tying it to their car but realize that the nugget is way bigger than it actually seems. The two decide to split up as one would have to go to the nearest town to get hold of an excavator, while the other would have to stay back and protect the gold. Although Hayes initially offers to stay back, Efron insists that he would rather stay and protect their new-found treasure. Hayes finally leaves with his car, now repaired, and Efron prepares to spend the next four or five days all by himself amidst the cruel open nature.As Hayes drives away in his car towards the nearest habitation, Efron settles down with his few little belongings, which include a bottle, a jerry can full of water, some food, and a satellite phone that Hayes gave him so that the two could maintain communication. Making a note of the exact position of the gold nugget, he covers it with dust again, and then sets up a makeshift lopsided hut for himself by tying a piece of tent cloth to a tree on one side and placing rocks on the other end. Dangers of nature soon present themselves as a scorpion crawls up near Efron's camp, but the man does not kill it and instead tries to drive it away. He then goes to gather firewood, for it is now very well established that he would need a fire to protect himself from wild dogs after dark. During his meager meal at night, of canned and dried food, the man hears the howling dogs in the distance, hungrily waiting for their chance to somehow manage to attack him. As days go by like this, he has to ration his supplies even more tightly, and he has to make choices regarding using water for hygiene or saving it for consumption. Now having to go out some more into the distance in search of firewood, Efron comes across some crashed airplane debris and decides to scavenge metals and other supplies from it. Ripping apart metal doors and windows, he tugs them back to camp and builds himself a stronger, more solid hut. With diminishing supplies and also because of having to spend hours all by himself, Efron breaks a smaller gold chunk from the nugget, but does not intend to keep it all for himself, as one would possibly think in such a situation. Instead, when Hayes calls him soon after to inform him of his position, Efron shares the news with him and suggests that they should go away with whatever little they can take, but the second man dismisses such a thought. That night, he has to take a walk through the abysmal darkness with only a stick lit on fire to protect himself, and he inevitably gets attacked by a group of wild dogs. However, he is saved just in time when a loud gunshot from somewhere nearby scatters the dogs away.The next morning, Efron tries to kill a snake for food but fails to match up with its slithery movements and continues on with a hungry body. In the afternoon, he goes over to the plane crash site again and, this time, spots a human figure coming toward him. He attempts to hide in the plane unsuccessfully and ultimately has to come out to face the stranger. This person, a woman dressed and armed appropriately for the desert, is a scavenger who goes around looting whatever and whoever she can and survives with it. She pesters Efron for a long time, trying to find out who he is and what he is doing alone in the middle of nowhere. When the man does not give any certain replies and just tries to avoid the conversation, the woman follows him back to his camp and tries to destroy his hut. When stopped, she tries to establish Efron as an outsider who is unfairly trying to take away resources from natives of the place like her, and then grows aggressive. Possibly in an attempt to protect himself, Efron strikes the woman with a shovel and, perhaps unwillingly, kills her. Taking away whatever he could find on her, he digs up a hole and buries her body in it, but soon sees the hungry wild dogs dig it up and try to eat it. He quickly gathers some more wood and burns up the body, for he does not want to disrespect her by feeding her remains to the dogs. The next day, he receives a call on the satellite phone from Hayes, who says that he is now bringing the excavator back to the place and promises to reach it within two or three days. Efron notices a local vehicle passing by and once thinks of asking for help and running away from his situation, but his greed, and also perhaps a sense that ""the situation is equally bad everywhere else,"" holds him back. Soon, a major sandstorm hits the place, and the man gets terribly injured when a flying tree branch impales his belly. After the storm has completely changed the look of the sandy desert, Efron crawls around with great pain and manages to find the gold nugget after a lot of effort. He also struggles to treat his wound and then falls into a hallucinatory trance and thinks that he imagines the woman he had earlier killed is now alive again. However, soon it is revealed that there is actually a second woman who looks exactly like the first, and she asks Efron if he has seen her sister, suggesting that they were twins. When the man denies seeing anyone, the woman offers to help him walk him to the nearest water source and settlement, but Efron insists on being left alone. As he seems to pass out and wake up again, he sees himself amidst a circle of small fires, definitely lit by the woman, as a group of dogs already move towards him, realizing that the man is about to die soon. As the fires grow weaker and the dogs' collective will and courage stronger, they start to attack Efron one by one, tearing into his flesh and finally dragging him away and biting him to death.As Efron is pulled and eaten away by the vicious pack of feral dogs, Anthony Hayes' character is finally seen some distance away from Efron's camp. Hayes seems to have made a camp of his own, where he seems to have been staying at least for two or three days, with his car and an excavator readily waiting beside him. He looks through a pair of binoculars at the final fate of Efron as he is killed by the forces of nature, and it becomes clear as day that Hayes was actually waiting for his partner to die so that he could take and keep all the gold for himself. After Efron is finally dead, Hayes drives up to the place and steps out to check the area. He spots the gold nugget and returns to his car to get something. As he returns, an arrow pierces straight into his chest, and the man instantly falls dead on the ground. 'Gold' cuts to black here, and the credits roll. It is again very obvious that it is the twin sister scavenger woman who has killed Hayes, for she was seen with a crossbow earlier. (thanks to dmtalkies)"

This is followed by Tom's sister Jeannie (Melissa Hunter) delivering a speech discussing her recent marital problems.Darcy and Tom try to wind down and get intimate with one another, but it is interrupted by Carol coming in to offer words that she thinks are encouraging, but they really aren't. The couple ends up sleeping separately.The next morning is wedding day. As preparations are being made, a group of pirates makes their way toward the island after seeing the couple's wedding website. Darcy is helped by Renata, Jamie, and Carol into her dress, but she feels that something isn't right. She texts Tom to meet privately, and Darcy says she feels that having everyone come to the Philippines for their wedding was too much, as she never wanted a big wedding. They argue until they decide that they ought to call off the wedding, just as the pirates storm the resort and take the staff and guests hostage. Tom witnesses this and runs to warn Darcy. The pirates force everyone into a pool and demand a $45 million ransom from Robert, as they know how wealthy he is.Tom gets Darcy out of her room and tells her what's happening.

While they attempt to subdue him with their own ideas (Tom wants to trap him in a net while Darcy thinks spraying his eyes with hairspray would do the trick), they both get taken down and are tied up together. The pirates then head with the couple to bring them to their leader, but Darcy asks for a cigarette and uses it to light the pirates' heads on fire, causing them to jump out and leaving the couple to try and take control of the driver less cart. They manage to jump out, but Darcy's dress gets caught and is mostly ripped off as the cart falls over a cliff. They are then attacked by one of the pirates, but Darcy manages to pull a grenade from his hand, and Tom kicks him and makes him fall against a rock, killing him. This leaves him mortified at killing a man.Darcy and Tom try to find a way to untie themselves, but Tom informs Darcy to be careful with the grenade she is holding because it doesn't have a pin in it, and her dropping it could set it off. They try to find an area with good cell reception so they can call for help, but they get chased by more pirates, and Darcy drops the phone. They find a zip line tower where they descend, and Darcy drops the grenade on two pirates, which alerts the others to their location when it blows up. When the couple lands, they are scared to see their loved ones being held hostage and try to find a way to get help.The couple goes into the kitchen to find a way to cut their bindings. A female pirate enters just as they cut themselves free with a deli slicer (but Tom gets a nasty cut on his hand that makes Darcy faint).

The owners, Margy (Selena Tan) and Ace (Alberto Isaac), hide the couple in their bunker. While tending to Tom's wound, Margy lets it slip that the resort was hit by pirates the previous summer, which Tom had known about. Darcy yells at Tom over this and his habit of self-sabotaging and his insecurities, which is what led him to make the big wedding. Tom hits back that Darcy is putting on a big front of being confident when she is also scared. Tom then takes responsibility for the hostages since he brought them all there. When another pirate starts getting close, Ace and Margy send the couple down a tunnel, but Tom gets out and turns himself in to be captured, leaving Darcy hidden.Tom is brought to the other hostages. He tells the lead pirate a phrase in Balinese (which means ""fuck your grandpa""), and he then holds Sean at knife-point. Tom deduced that Sean is the bad guy who hired the pirates because Sean had said the phrase earlier, and Tom figured the pirates are Balinese. He even produces a wedding invitation that one of the pirates had, and Tom states that Sean had hoped to get the ransom from Robert since he did not give him investment money. Sean drops the act and breaks free, joining the pirates and holding a gun at Tom.Darcy begins to feel bad while staying with Ace and Margy over her argument with Tom, so she is encouraged to save everyone herself. Sean takes the lead pirate with him to go find Darcy, using Harriet as collateral and taking her with him in his helicopter. Darcy arrives with a gun and tries to reconcile with Tom before taking on the pirates. The pirates end up taking Darcy with the other hostages, with one of the pirates personally wanting to kill Darcy because she burned his face. The others then learn that Harriet was in on the scheme the whole time, as Larry had been recording everything and got footage of her and Sean making out. While in the helicopter, Harriet kills the lead pirate by hitting a pressure point to paralyze him and then throws him out of the helicopter.Darcy and Tom devise a plan by doing an impromptu wedding ceremony in the pool, which the pirates allow. Carol leads everyone to sing the song ""I'll Be"" before the couple seizes an opportunity to fight back (with Carol getting her hands on a rifle too). They use another grenade to kill the pirates, setting off some fireworks that alert Sean and Harriet. Ace and Margy help the guests get to safety while Darcy and Tom try to stop the villains.The couple makes it to the docks, where they subdue a young pirate and try to take the motorboat that Tom was going to surprise Darcy with. They are found by Sean, who attempts to get Darcy on his side, but she refuses to join him. She and Tom hop in the boat while Sean hangs on to go after them. Harriet attempts to shoot at them from the helicopter. As Darcy speeds the boat up, Tom and Sean get caught in a para-sail that flies upwards. Tom uses a chunk of fake hair to zip line down, and Darcy uses a cake knife that Carol gave her to cut the para-sail loose, causing Sean to get shredded by the helicopter's blades, and Harriet goes down into the ocean when the helicopter crashes.Darcy and Tom make it back to the island, where they fully reconcile and agree to go on with their wedding. Authorities show up to arrest the surviving pirates, and Darcy and Tom finally get married. Jamie and Ricky (who were hooking up) then accidentally set off the last firework."
Thirteen Lives,2022,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt12262116/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A rescue mission is assembled in Thailand where a group of young boys and their soccer coach are trapped in a system of underground caves that are flooding. On June 23, 2018, twelve boys of the junior football team ""Wild Boars"" and their assistant coach Ekkaphon Chanthawong leave practice to explore the Tham Luang cave. When the team fails to arrive at a birthday party organized by their parents, their families head to the caves, only to find them flooded and the boys missing, their bikes left at the entrance. The parents immediately alert emergency services. Royal Thai Navy SEALs, led by Captain Arnont (Teerapat Sajakul), arrive to search for the missing boys, but find the dive too difficult to locate the team.

The caves are very deep. Chamber 3 is 800 m from the entrance. Suddenly, it starts raining and the save starts filling up with water. The rains are totally unexpected and nonseasonal and catches the team off guard. Its well known that the caves flood in the monsoons.
When the team fail to arrive at a birthday party organized by their parents, their families head to the caves, only to find them flooded and the boys missing, their bikes left at the entrance. The parents immediately alert emergency services. word reaches Governor Narongsak Osatanakorn (Sahajak Boonthanakit), who deploys the Thai Navy Seals.Royal Thai Navy SEALs, led by Captain Arnont (Teerapat Sajakul), arrive to search for the missing boys, but find the dive too difficult to locate the team. Vernon Unsworth (Lewis Fitz-Gerald), a local British caver, shares his extensive knowledge of the complex and dangerous cave (he had mapped the entire cave extensively on paper) and suggests the authorities get in touch with the British Cave Rescue Council. The first rescue attempt reaches chamber 3 and has to turn back when they encounter a flash flood.
DAy 2, more agencies get mobilized and the effort is to pump water out of the caves. The attempts are futile as there are many sinkholes on the mountain which are feeding water all over the caves.. The pumps are not fast enough.
Thousands of Thai and international volunteers join the rescue effort to help in anyway they can. A temp base is set up in Chamber 3.Day 5. British cavers Rick Stanton (Viggo Mortensen) and John Volanthen (Colin Farrell) attempt the dive (They reach the stalactite tunnel 900 ms from the entrance. They get to T junction 1600 M from the entrance in 3 hrs and 49 mins). Mid way through the dive they find a stranded rescuer who was trying to fix the pumps and John takes him back to Chamber 3 from where he is taken to safety. John and Rick return from T junction, which is also till where the Thai Navy seals had gotten to and had already laid guide lines up to that place.
Day 7, and there is still no sign of the boys or their coach. The governor holds a meeting of all teams. the Navy seals wants the rain to stop before going back in. John and Rick offer to go in then and now. The governor decides to hold back the divers till the rains stop.
Meanwhile, as hundreds of volunteers try to mitigate poor weather conditions, a water technician from Bangkok (who has discovered all the sinkholes on the mountains, which are filling up the caves, and can block them with the help of the locals) gains the permission of local farmers to divert water from the mountain onto their fields, destroying their crop.Day 9, the rains finally give a break. The governor decides to send in Rick and John as the Navy seals still need 24 hrs for prep. The guys reach T junction and start laying their own guide lines. Eventually, they find the boys and coach in chamber 9, about 2500 ms from the entrance (total dive time of 6 hrs and 12 mins). Rick and John find all 13 of the missing boys and coach alive.
Rick is distraught as he knows that if the Thai wait for the water to be pumped out, the boys will never come out alive. The kids are likely to panic on the 2.5 km dive back and are very likely to get injured or die. Still Rick and John brief the Thai Navy seals on the route beyond T junction.
Day 11. The Thai team delivers some food and medicines to the boys. But they use too much O2 coming in and now only one of them can get out safely. The O2 in chamber 9 is only 16% and dropping quickly.
Day 12. The parents start losing patience and still the Thai teams have no clue as to how to get the boys out.Realising the boys will have to be removed through the cave, via a 6 hour dive, Stanton and Volanthen contact Dr. Richard Harris (Joel Edgerton), plus supporting divers Chris Jewell (Tom Bateman) and Jason Mallinson (Paul Gleeson). They work with the Thai teams to deliver food to the stranded boys on Day 14.
Day 15. In an attempt to deliver wet-suits to the boys in preparation for the rescue, former Thai Navy Seal Saman Kunan drowns (Sukollawat Kanarot).
Harris is not sure as too much anesthetic and the boys can die of respiratory failure, too little and they wake up underwater and drown.Day 16. With permission from the regional governor and minister, the divers sedate the boys and, with one diver per boy, carry each member out of the cave safely. Day 16, 4 boys are carried out. The boys have to given injections for sedatives every half hr. Harris was expecting casualties, but all the boys make it through. Under immense secrecy the 4 rescued boys are taken to a city hospital. The govt doesn't want to release any details to the media or the parents till the rescue operation is complete.
Day 17, 5 more boys are rescued. The monsoon clouds are gathering over the mountains and time is running out fast.
Day 18, the remaining boys are carried out. The coach is removed last.Removed to hospital, the parents are reunited with the team. The end scene is the boys celebrating the birthday party that was supposed to happen on the day they went into the cave. The end credits reveal that the coach and three of the boys, who were all stateless, are given Thai citizenship.
The film is dedicated to Saman Kunan, the Thai Navy Seal who died while resupplying air tanks on July 6, 2018. The credits also mention another Navy Seal, Beirut Pakbara, who later died from a blood infection.
Volunteers diverted 56 MM gallons of water from the cave. Farmers who lost their crops were offered compensation. 5000 people from 17 countries contributed to the effort."
Devotion,2022,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7693316/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A pair of U.S. Navy fighter pilots risk their lives during the Korean War and become some of the Navy's most celebrated wingmen. 1950. Ensign Jesse Brown and Lt(jg) Tom Hudner join Navy Fighter Squadron VF-32 at roughly the same time and Brown is assigned as Hudner's wingman. They are quickly the best of friends and always look out for each other. Later that year war breaks out in Korea and VF-32, onboard the carrier USS Leyte, provides air support. Their missions are vital to the war effort and extremely dangerous.—grantss Two close friends are Naval aviation pilots and they are positioned on an aircraft carrier during the Korean war in 1950. Their friendship is put to a test when one is in emergency when he crash lands a sick aircraft and the other has to mount a rescue mission. Will the mission succeed?—Madan Marwah 1950Lieutenant Tom Hudner (Glen Powell) is a naval aviator who has transferred to Rhode Island. He walks into the locker room and hears a stern commotion coming from the restrooms. Ensign Jesse Brown (Jonathan Majors) walks out and asks if he's the transfer.Hudner meets the other guys in the Fighter Squadron 32: Carol Mohring (Nick Hargrove), Bo Lavery (Spencer Neville), Marty Goode (Joe Jonas), and Bill Koenig (Darren Kagasoff), led by Lieutenant Commander Dick Cevoli (Thomas Sadoski) who shows them intel that Stalin and the Soviets tested their own bomb and it won't be long until they strap it to a bomber. Cevoli assigns Hudner with Brown.In the air, Brown flies without thinking about risks. He's always in control, just not by the book. They take a detour on the way home. Hudner follows him because a wing-man never leaves his partner. The flying isn't what Hudner is used to. Brown even nose dives in a residential neighborhood and if you look closely, a nice lady, Daisy Brown (Christina Jackson), stands in her front yard waving at them as they pull up at the last minute.Back in the locker room, Hudner asks Brown what was up with that. Brown replies ""the only way to find out about your wing-man is at 2,000 feet."" Hudner asks if he wants to grab a beer to get to know him, but Brown declines. He does not drink.Cevoli has the squad over to his house for clams. Hudner tells Lavery he signed up with the Navy right after hearing about Pearl Harbor. He graduated one month after the war ended. Lavery says life doesn't turn out like you plan, ""I mean, did you ever think you'd be in a squadron with a colored aviator?"" Hudner dodges the question and moves to the food.Brown drives home. He waves to a neighbor who is not happy to see him. He tiptoes inside and scares his wife, Daisy, as she's painting the hallway walls. They have a fun, loving relationship and a three-year-old daughter, Pam.Cevoli briefs the team. A recon plane washed ashore with bullet holes underneath. The team will now prepare to be ready for the Russians in a new type of plane, aka widow maker. The engine is one of the most powerful things these pilots will fly behind. Throttle too much, and she'll spin you over. There's enough torque to flip a house. The pilots must go easy.On the way home, Hudner sees Brown on the side of the road with car trouble. He offers him a ride home. Hudner tells him he was called to adventure and didn't want to take over his father's grocery stores. Brown always wanted to fly, and with the best pilots, so he joined the Navy. At the Brown residence, Daisy offers Hudner a drink but Brown declines because Hudner must have plans. Hudner takes the hint and graciously declines the offer. Daisy tells Brown to play nice, but Brown doesn't know about Hudner yet.The pilots check out the widow makers in person. They all run drills and get used to flying the new type of plane. They get the news they are shipping out. Daisy boosts Brown's confidence before he leaves home.The next day, Brown hides in the bathroom stall. Until everyone else in the locker room has left, he stares at himself in the mirror. And says numerous degrading comments to himself.Hudner's in his plane. Everyone on the team is watching as he makes his landing. He does it without trouble. Next, it's Brown's turn. All of the Black crew members on the carrier come up to see. Brown is flying too high. Hudner says he needs to get his nose up. The flag man guides him up, and Brown misses the carrier. He comes back around and feels the pressure. He is able to land the plane. Everyone has passed their carrier quals, and Hudner passed with perfect scores.They are shipping out tomorrow, and Cevoli tells them to get their affairs in order. Hudner gives Brown a lift home, and Brown invites him inside this time. Daisy offers Hudner a drink and asks him to be there for Brown.Brown enjoys his evening with his family at the beach.The next day on the carrier, the team runs down the hallways, up the stairs, and to their planes. But it's just a drill, and Cevoli says they have to do better. The team returns to their quarters, but Brown is asked to interview with Life Magazine for a positive story to ease the public's anxiety about another potential war. Brown wants to be treated like any other pilot, while the interviewer wants the colored angle. Cevoli comes to his rescue and pulls Brown back to work.Below deck, one of the army guys asks if Brown juggles too. Hudner goes nose-to-nose with the guy, but Brown makes the pilots talk away. Brown and Hudner will talk later. Hudner wanted to teach that guy a lesson, while Brown says it's better this way.Cevoli needs a volunteer for a task that no one wants to do. Hudner volunteers like Brown nudges Mohring to do it, and Hudner lets him. Mohring completes the tasks in the plane but can't make the landing. The plane crashes into the ocean. Everyone is troubled by Mohring's death, but Brown lets Hudner know he doesn't appreciate him making comments about what Mohring should have/could have done. Hudner insists the pilots won't die if they do what they're told. Later, the pilots give a toast to Mohring. Once it's just Brown and Hudner, Brown tells Hudner at the academy. They made him do his tests ten times because they didn't believe a Black man could swim. Stuck rocks in his flight suit, held him under and put ice in the water. They didn't care if he died in that pool, but every time Brown made it out. He would be dead if he did what people told him to do. That's what he was trying to teach Mohring.They dock in Caan. The pilots go ashore and sight-see. Brown runs into a store for Daisy's gift and sees a crowd of sailors. He goes to see what's up, and it's actress Elizabeth Taylor. One of the sailors makes a derogatory comment about not being with Brown. Elizabeth Taylor invites Brown to a casino party later that night. The pilots show up but are denied access to the french casino. But Brown starts speaking French, and they reluctantly let them in.After dancing and drinking, they thank Elizabeth and head to another spot. Hudner spots a beautiful woman and flirts with her by doing a magic trick. The army guys from the carrier show up, and a fight starts because the guy thinks he had a shot with Elizabeth back at the casino, and Brown messed that up for him.Cevoli briefs the team. The North Koreans have taken Seoul. If they take the rest of the southern peninsula, they could take Japan, and then America can't contain Communism.The ship sets sail for Korea. There may be one hundred thousand Chinese already in North Korea. The mission is to take out two bridges over a major river along the border, hoping to slow the Chinese from sending in more troops.This time Cevoli flies with the team. But Hudner confirms that Cevoli's plane has a mechanical issue with his landing gear and passes the command to Hudner. They fly over and are met with enemy fire. They cannot completely destroy the bridges, but Brown disobeys orders and returns to finish the job.In Korea, the army guys are now on the ground, freezing their behinds off and waiting for the Chinese to attack. They do, and it's an uneven fight.Hudner hands in his mission report to Cevoli. He stated exactly what happened. Brown confronts him about it and says discipline for Brown is different than discipline for anyone else. Hudner understands and asks the team to write their accounts to clear Brown. Hudner walks in on Brown, repeating to himself in the mirror every hateful word anyone has ever said to him. Hudner tells him that he got the other guys to give testimony that the mission was complicated and Brown did the right thing. But Brown knows a piece of paper won't help him. Hudner asks him what he wants him to do and Brown replies, ""just be my wing-man. Forget the lifesaver and get in the damn water.""On deck, Brown gets some fresh air. He's joined by a Black crew member. He tells Brown that they all heard he had some good flying the other day and wanted to let Brown know they saw him. They all pitched in and bought him a watch in Caan. Engraved on the back is ""Above All Others."" Brown is touched by this gesture.On the runway, Brown runs into a friend from the past who he calls Alabama. Alabama is with the search and rescue unit.Daisy receives a letter from Brown. He hid her birthday gift and gave clues for her to find it. She finds the gift, earrings, in Pam's closet. He closes his letter with ""lovingly and completely yours. I'll love you forever.""Cevoli and the team are briefed. The army is fighting in an unspeakable hell. For every marine, there are six Chinese hiding in the woods. Gets below minus thirty at night. The boys are holding on by their fingernails, and air support would greatly help, but it is a dangerous mission.On the ground, the marines pray and finally advance their vantage point when the pilots arrive. They give them hell, but once they leave the area, Hudner notices Brown's plane is leaking fuel. Brown states that it's oil. He needs to take the plane down easily because he won't last much longer. Cevoli calls in search and rescue. Brown releases all of his missiles so they won't end up in the enemy's hands. Brown lands hard. Hudner can't see him moving. He decides to crash land his plane to be with Brown. The other pilots try to talk him out of it, but he takes his plane down after releasing his missiles.He runs to Brown, who is wedged between his seat and the control panel. Both men try to lift it off him, but they can't.Search and rescue gets Cevoli's mayday call, but it's too dark to land. Alabama overhears and tells them he's on his way.In the freezing cold, Hudner gives Brown his beanie cap to keep him warm. Hudner tries to extinguish the fire on Brown's engine with snow. Brown is still stuck when Alabama arrives. They try to get him free, but he's still wedged. Brown becomes weaker and weaker and asks Hudner to tell Daisy he'll always love her. Hudner starts beating the plane with all his might to free Brown but stops once he realizes that Brown has passed away.They leave, and Hudner promises to come back for Brown. Hudner begs his commanders to let him go back for Brown's body, but they deny him. Brown's body was never recovered.Back on the carrier, Hudner is checked out by the doctor. Cevoli leads the other pilots on a funeral flight to say goodbye to Brown.Daisy receives a letter from the war department. She is overcome with emotion. Time passes, and Daisy flies to Washington, where President Truman gives the Medal of Honor to Jesse Brown and Tom Hudner. After the ceremony, Hudner speaks to Daisy about being afraid of this day. Daisy tells him she appreciates what he did. Hudner says Brown's last words were for her, ""just tell Daisy I love her."" Hudner apologizes for not saving him. Daisy says that wasn't his job. She wanted him to be there for him, and he was.The Hudner and Brown families remained friends for the rest of their lives, and their descendants remained close. The film closes with Brown reading his last letters to Daisy with his signature sign off ""Your devoted husband, lovingly and completely yours. Jesse."""

But when he accidentally pisses off a vengeful spirit, his big comeback event becomes a real-time fight for his life. The film centers on Shawn, a disgraced YouTube personality known for videos featuring him performing stunts to ""overcome his fears."" Prior to the start of the film, one of Shawn's videos resulted in a serious controversy that lost him his sponsors and much of his fanbase. Desperate to regain his popularity and retain his new sole sponsor, Shawn plans to livestream himself spending the night in Death Manor, a purportedly haunted house where several people have died.As part of the deal with the sponsor, if Shawn leaves or doesn't fully explore the house, he forfeits the sponsorship. Throughout the stream Shawn periodically opens the chat screen to react to his viewers' comments. As the livestream begins, Shawn throws his car's sparkplugs into the woods, then locks the door behind him and throws the key down a grate. While setting up his cameras, he narrates Death Manor's history: It is haunted by the ghost of Mildred Pratt, a wealthy Mormon heiress and failed poet, who died by suicide after her publisher and paramour's sudden death. Subsequent occupants of the house died mysteriously and the place was eventually abandoned. Shawn speculates that the various deaths over the years were Mildred trying to build a family she was unable to have in life. Shawn tours the house and introduces each room, including one with no history of paranormal activity. He declares it the safe room and sets up his equipment there. He discovers a strange symbol hanging in a closet, removes it and later destroys it in a panic.Afterwards, Shawn attempts to provoke the spirits via a séance. After experiencing some strange noises, he fearfully shuts himself up in his room. It turns out to be Chrissy, a super fan who has traveled to Death Manor to meet him. Shawn, reluctant to share his spotlight, begrudgingly allows her stay to please his viewers. They investigate more of the house, finding Mildred's poetry book, which Shawn dismisses as mediocre as it ""doesn't even rhyme"". As the two attempt to speak to the spirit of Mildred through a spirit board, Chrissy convinces Shawn to recite a Latin phase to put the ghosts to rest.As Chrissy repeatedly tries to scare Shawn, he suddenly recalls that he locked the door to the Manor, meaning Chrissy had to have waited there for Shawn. He accuses her of being a stalker and tells her to leave. She attacks him, biting his neck. In self defense he stabs her in the neck. Believing he's killed her, Shawn intends to leave and turn himself in, but finds her body gone. Shawn searches the grate he had thrown his key down, but only finds the key to a box containing a severed finger and a picture revealing that Chrissy is actually Mildred Pratt. Knowledgeable viewers discover that the symbol he destroyed earlier was a hamsa meant to protect against evil. Also, the Latin phrase he recited was a soul offering that Mildred had used to bind the souls of the previous occupants to herself. After being terrorized by the grotesque ghouls of the previous occupants, Shawn makes several attempts to flee the house and eventually jumps out the second floor window.Shawn finds the spark plugs, but comes across more ghouls. After fighting one off with a potato gun, his iPad is damaged. Cut off from his viewers and resigned to his fate, Shawn takes shelter in his car and reads from Mildred's book of poetry. He discovers the incantation that Mildred used to gain her satanic powers, and the phrase repeated by the ghostly voices is actually in one of the poems. Putting the pieces together, he realizes Mildred never wanted a family, but an audience for her poetry. He becomes inspired to complete the ritual to circumvent her power through his own audience and send her back to hell.Shawn arms himself, returns to the house to challenge Mildred. Fighting his way back to the saferoom, he retrieves a spare iPad and reads the comments that translate the incantation. While setting up the ritual, Shawn awkwardly apologizes for his insensitive stunts, racism, and poor apology, vowing to be better.After a grueling fight with Mildred, Shawn gets the upper hand and reads the incantation, which didn't work. Spotting her severed finger, he remembers the ritual requires a ""sacrifice of flesh"". He cuts off one of his fingers, which completes the ritual, with Mildred being dragged into a blood-filled basement by an unseen force. Shawn celebrates, thanking his now massive viewer count for helping him survive the night. However, as he exits, he is surrounded by Mildred's surviving ghoul audience and his livestream cuts out.

Troll,2022,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11116912/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Deep in the Dovre mountain, something gigantic wakes up after a thousand years in captivity. The creature destroys everything in its path and quickly approaches Oslo. Deep inside the mountain of Dovre, Norway, something gigantic awakens after being trapped for a thousand years. Destroying everything in its path, the creature is fast approaching the capital of Norway, with city-dweller struggling to stop something they thought existed only in Norwegian folklore. As a young girl, Nora Tidemann's father, Tobias, teaches her the mythology of Trolls and the origin of their local mountains. During one story, Nora almost ""sees"" the faces of trolls turned to stone in the rock face.Years later, a drilling operation tunneling through the mountains of Dovre results in an eruption and the deaths of several workers and protestors. Desperate for answers, the Norwegian government recruits a diverse array of scientists, including Nora, who is now a paleontologist on her first major find. While the collected scientists initially believe that the eruption was caused by the miners hitting a pocket of Methane, only Nora and the prime minister's advisor, Andreas Isaksan, point out that the region is surrounded by large impressions that appear to be footprints. The prime minister permits them to investigate the possibility further with Norwegian military soldier, Captain Kris Holm, when a second incident miles away tears apart the home of an elderly couple near Lesja.Nora begins to believe that a Troll may be responsible and the three seek assistance from Tobias, who has since lost his professorship for his belief in the existence of a real basis for mythical creatures. After a quick search of the mountains, Tobias identifies a topographical anomaly and the four accidentally awaken the slumbering Troll, having camouflaged itself on the mountainside. They escape, capturing the first tangible video proof of Nora's theory. The prime minister arranges a military operation led by Kris; however, conventional weapons only annoy the troll. Tobias tries communicating with the troll but is killed when the creature is startled by more gunfire. Researching the mythology, Nora recommends a sonic attack using church bells, but it enrages instead of incapacitates the creature, causing immense collateral damage. Following the rampage, international news outlets pick up the story and broadcast it globally.As the troll heads to Norway's capital Oslo, the prime minister orders a complete evacuation of the city. After learning of the government's plan to destroy the troll with a nuclear bomb on Oslo, Nora and Andreas object, but are dismissed from the task force. Nora makes a last attempt to find out the truth about the creature. Tobias' notes lead them to the Royal Palace, where they meet Chief of Court Rikard Sinding, who reveals the truth about trolls in Norway. Tobias had been right all along; Trolls had been living in Norway until they were wiped out by Christian settlers and the truth buried in folklore. When Nora's father got too close to the truth, Sinding had him discredited and committed to a mental health hospital. The Royal palace was built on top of the Troll King's palace after the Christians massacred his family and left him for dead inside a cavern in the Dovre mountains. Nora concludes that the creature is heading for Oslo in an attempt to return home.Discovering that trolls are vulnerable to direct sunlight, Nora and Kris plan to expose the troll to UV light from a number of tanning beds. While Kris calls on fellow soldiers to make the troll trap, Andreas asks his friend Sigrid at the secret government facility to delay the bombing of Oslo. Sigrid hacks into the military's system to halt the nuclear strike. Nora and Andreas place the skull of one of the troll's babies in the back of the Queen's truck and lure him to the UV light trap. Nora has a last-minute change of heart, turns off the lights, and tries to save the creature's life. However, the sun then rises into a clear sky and kills the troll. While everyone else rejoices, Andreas and Nora wonder if more trolls are still alive deep inside Norway's mountains.In the aftermath, something seems to emerge with a roar from the rubble inside the Dovre mountain cave."

This is set in the near future, when convicts are offered the chance to volunteer as medical subjects in hopes of shortening their sentences. When one prisoner finds himself the test patient for a new pharmaceutical capable of generating feelings of love, he begins questioning the reality of his emotions and sets out to discover the truth.

The test subjects, technically prisoners of the state, are volunteers for the project aiming to reduce their sentence time. The program is overseen by the sympathetic and hospitable Steve Abnesti, along with his assistant Mark. The prisoners have their own rooms, do chores, and are free to roam without guard supervision. The subjects go through daily test runs of various drugs, all of which alter their emotions and their perceptions of their surroundings.Inmate Jeff, still reeling from having killed his friend whilst drunk driving, is given N-40, a ""love drug"", which distorts his senses and drives him to have sex with two of his fellow inmates.

The drugs were named from a bingo card.Steve and Jeff get high together on a laughing drug, as Steve also has a MobiPak installed. Steve tells Jeff that his father abandoned him as a child. Jeff confesses to Lizzy, an inmate he is close with, that he not only killed his friend in the car accident but his girlfriend as well. Lizzy hugs him and they kiss. Steve notices Jeff's feelings for Lizzy. Mark becomes doubtful of Steve's motives, and he breaks down when Jeff confronts him.When Steve asks Jeff to administer Darkenfloxx to Lizzy, Jeff takes control of Steve's MobiPak, reveals that Mark has spiked his Mobipak with Darkenfloxx, and forces him to admit the true goal of the program: testing a compliance drug, B-6. The other drugs are merely side projects being used to put B-6 to the ultimate test: whether or not they would harm their love when commanded to. The entire time inmates had been consenting to the various tests, they had really been under the influence of the obedience drug. In addition, Steve informs Jeff that he had in fact finished his sentence seven months previously, while Lizzy's appeal for release had passed the previous week. Jeff forces Steve to open the door of the main entrance to free Lizzy and then tries to order him to hand over the pocket knife. Steve resists the order (as complying would be killing the project, ""the only thing he has ever loved""), and instead takes his phone and enables all four vials of Darkenfloxx in Lizzy's MobiPak, causing her to behave hysterically and attempt suicide. The two fight for control and Jeff is able to disarm Steve, damaging his MobiPak in the process. Jeff rushes to save Lizzy, successfully removes the vials of Darkenfloxx and tells her he loves her, but Steve gets up and orders the other inmates to apprehend Jeff and Lizzy. They are able to escape from Spiderhead after overpowering some of the other inmates and locking the main door behind them. Mark and the police are now approaching the island as Steve escapes on his float-plane, but he joyously crashes into a mountain as he is now high off of his damaged MobiPak. Meanwhile, Jeff and Lizzy take the remaining motorboat and escape.In a voice-over, Jeff comments that no drug can bestow self-forgiveness, instead it must be worked on and chosen.

Spirited,2022,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10999120/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A musical version of Charles Dickens's story of a miserly misanthrope who is taken on a magical journey. A musical version of the classic Christmas story by Charles Dickens. A miserly man who treats everyone around him with terrible selfishness finds himself on a fantastical adventure into the three phases of time: past, present, and future, in order to discover how he ended up so miserable and alone. Each Christmas Eve, the Ghost of Christmas Present (Will Ferrell) selects one dark soul to be reformed by a visit from three spirits. But this season, he picked the wrong Scrooge. Clint Briggs (Ryan Reynolds) turns the tables on his ghostly host until Present finds himself reexamining his own past, present and future. For the first time, ""A Christmas Carol"" is told from the perspective of the ghosts in this hilarious musical twist on the classic Dickens tale. From Director Sean Anders (""Daddy's Home,"" ""Instant Family""), written by Sean Anders and John Morris, with original songs by Oscar winners Benj Pasek and Justin Paul (""La La Land"") and production numbers choreographed by Chloe Arnold (""The Late Late Show with James Corden""), this modern retelling is a sweet and spicy holiday treat.—Official Synopsis Convinced that people can change, the benevolent Ghost of Christmas Present takes on a challenging mission: help heartless media consultant Clint Briggs see the error of his ways and become a force for good in the world. Instead, as the Ghosts of Christmas Past and Yet-To-Come pitch in and do their part, the Ghost of Christmas Present finds himself faced with an unforeseen complication. What happens if the irredeemable manipulator is incapable of change?—Nick Riganas But not really. This isn't Christmas Carol, it's a movie about the ability to stay redeemed long term. And doing it everyday, and then doing it again even if you fail occasionally. It's about the consequences of the choices we make and being aware of those before we hit ""send"". And it's a fun musical. All the haters out there, like movie critics, will wake up tomorrow and still be awful because some people really are unredeemable. I mean it, movie critics on this site really are unredeemable. Merry Christmas?
The movie starts with the Christnas Carol theme. BUT this version is about the spirit of Christmas Present, CP. Christmas Present, CP, wants a challenge, a chance to impact a life where a change will make real differences, big ripples in kindness. The ""office"" wants him to consider retirement and get a life.
Christmas Present finds his target, in the reprehensible character, played by Ryan Reynolds, Clint Briggs. Clint's firm makes its wealth by creating negative attack adds and running offensive click bait on social media. But Clint's real theme is his belief that people never really change. Christmas Present wants to prove Clint wrong. But not to save Clint. Turns out Christmas Present (spoiler alert) is the original unredeemable Scrooge himself, who, it turns out died just three weeks after being redeemed. Christmas Present is hiding a fear, that he isn't really changed.
While leading Clint thru the spirits, Christmas Present falls for a Clint employee, a truly wonderful women, Kimberly, who hates the she has become helping Clint get rich and climbing the corporate ladder. She hits all time low by doing opposition research on a child to help Clint's niece win class President.The series of events past, present and future unfold for Clint, interrupted by Clint avoidance, and CPs self-awareness. All this filled with song and dance as back stage heaven actors make the flash backs work.
Not unexpectedly people do change. CP decides to try retirement. CP doesn't think he has changed, not really, but he has a friend now in CP. There is great songs, great fun, a nice twist on human doubt and failure and the idea that redemption doesn't happen over night. It's a tear jerker, yes a dieing sister, but lots of human weakness and a slam at HR. Enjoy."

Toby Nealey (George MacKay) is a politically-minded, 23-year-old graffiti artist who breaks into the homes of upper-class individuals and leaves behind the message ""I CAME BY"" on the walls. His latest target is retired judge Hector Blake (Hugh Bonneville). Despite the judge appearing socially progressive in public (he would take on cases pro-Bono on behalf of immigrants), Toby believes he's a hypocrite (Blake's father was a colonialist and Blake still has ivory pieces of antiques in his house). When Toby enters Blake's house, he discovers a pottery studio and an imprisoned man in the basement. But Toby has to leave when Blake returns unexpected (he had received an alarm about his wireless alarm system being disabled at his house).Toby tries to tell his friend and former accomplice, Jameel ""Jay"" Agassi (Percelle Ascott), about what he found. However, Jay's distracted by personal troubles with his pregnant girlfriend, Naserine ""Naz"" Raheem (Varada Sethu). Naz is thrown out of her house by her parents and Jay has to take her in and provide for her. Jay says he cant do anymore missions with Toby. He refuses to listen to Toby, when he seeks help with what he saw at Blake's house. Toby anonymously calls the police, but they find nothing in Blake's house and leave. There are noises coming from the basement, but Blake makes it look like they are coming from the washing machine.Lizzie (Kelly Macdonald), Toby's widowed mother, has grown increasingly worried about her son's lack of direction. When she and Toby get into a shouting match, she throws him out of the house. Toby insults Lizzie by saying that his dad bought the house and she has done nothing to earn it. To top it, he demands that he be given the money that his dad left him, but Lizzie says he is not ready to handle that kind of cash.
Toby returns to Blake's residence to free the prisoner, but Blake again returns unexpectedly & murders Toby with a cricket bat. He then uses the kiln in his studio to cremate Toby's body, and flushes the ashes down the toilet.Jay is reluctant to disclose his graffiti activities with Toby to the police or to Lizzie, but plants a letter addressed to Blake in Toby's room. The letter spurs the police to visit Blake's home again (Since the last known location of Toby's mobile was also the same street as Blake's house) and they find the basement prison, which Blake claims is a ""panic room.""

Vesper,2022,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt20225374/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Struggling to survive with her father after the collapse of Earth's ecosystem, 13-year-old Vesper must use her wits, strength and bio-hacking abilities to fight for the future. After the collapse of Earth's ecosystem, Vesper, a 13-year-old girl struggling to survive with her paralyzed father, meets a woman with a secret who will force her to use her wits, strengths and bio-hacking abilities to fight for the possibility of having a future. After an ecological catastrophe of apocalyptic proportions renders the Earth an inhospitable planet, 13-year-old Vesper finds herself burdened with a nearly impossible task. But there is no hope for the future when home is a strange world. And then, the young scavenger makes an eye-opening discovery while foraging for food in the hostile forest. Now, as Vesper puts her razor-sharp skills to good use to unearth a well-hidden secret, a pressing question emerges. Is this unexpected breakthrough humankind's last chance of survival?—Nick Riganas Humanity tried to prevent the impending ecological crisis by investing massively in genetic technology. It failed. Engineered viruses and organisms escaped into the wild. They wiped out edible plants, animals and large populations of humans. An oligarchy now thrives in enclosed cities called 'citadels' while everyone else struggles to survive. For food, people rely on seeds traded by the citadels. However, these are coded to produce only one harvest.The people outside of the citadel must find food and resources on their own. The citadel gives them modified seeds that require a special process to be made fertile. Only the scientists of the citadels know the details of this process.
Vesper (Raffiella Chapman) is a 13-year old girl who lives in a house in the forest with her father Darius (Richard Brake) who is paralyzed. Darius can only communicate by using a drone that looks like a floating robot head. He uses the drone to accompany Vesper in her daily routine while his real body stays in bed. Vesper conducts experiments in an abandoned lab on bio-hacking the seeds to make them grow without the process from the citadels.A year ago Vesper's mother left to be part of a group of people called The Pilgrims. They are scavengers and drag the junk they collect (they never real their face and they wander alone till they die). Vesper's uncle Jonas (Eddie Marsan) lives not far away. He manages a sort of orphanage that he uses to extract blood from the children and sell it to the citadel. Jonas also owns beings called Jugs (Melanie Gaydos), artificial humans made with the sole purpose of being a slave-work force.
Vesper sells her own blood to Jonas to get supplies and parts for her generator that keeps Darius alive. Jonas wants Vesper to become a breeder, but she refuses. Jonas tries to stiff Vesper by refusing her the bacteria promised for the blood, so Vesper breaks into Jonas's sheds and steals some bacteria (as fuel for the generators) and also some seeds.One day a citadel ship crashes nearby and Vesper finds a young woman survivor, Camellia (Rosy McEwen). Vesper takes her home and heals her wounds. Camellia promises to take Vesper and her father to the citadel if they can find the other passenger of the ship, a man named Elias (Edmund Dehn). However, when Vesper goes to check she finds that Jonas is also there. Jonas kills Elias and suspects that there was another passenger on the ship. Vesper does not reveal Camelia's presence in her home.
Vesper decides to communicate with the citadel so that they can come and pick up Camellia but the only transmitter is with Jonas. She shows Camelia her greenhouse, where she conducts her bio-genetic experiments to breed plants. Camelia reveals that Elias is the head of synthetic biology at the citadel and would love Vesper's work.
Vesper sneaks into Jonas's farm, but this time she is caught. She lies and says that she came for what Jonas owed her. Jonas lets her go. On her way back, Vesper finds the body of one of Jonas's orphans who helped her steal the seeds the last time around.
When Vesper reveals to Camellia that Elias is dead, the woman mourns him deeply. Vesper realizes that Camellia isn't human, she is a very advanced Jug (she has a cut on her back, just like all other jugs), one who looks exactly like a human and has emotions. Elias is her creator, but making a sentient Jug is a crime, and so he and Camellia needed to escape. They were going to another citadel where Elias had negotiated a refugee status. This is why Elias never sent an SOS before his ship crashed.
Vesper uses the seeds stolen from her uncle Jonas' farm for an experiment involving samples from the synthetic Camellia. Camellia plays a tune from a musical instrument that causes the ""locked"" bacteria in the seeds to unlock. Vesper assumes she found a way to ""unlock"" the Citadel seeds and make them fertile so they will never starve again. Camellia says that Elias did this intentionally to end the hegemony of the citadels over the food supply.Jonas comes to the house and finds out about Camellia and that she is a jug. Vesper and Camellia manage to overpower him. Vesper makes a deal: If he leaves them alone he can have the seeds and enough food. Jonas goes back to his place and calls the citadel, revealing to them about Camellia. Soldiers from the citadel arrive and kill Jonas before going to Vesper's house.
Camellia and Vesper run while Darius stays behind and holds off the soldiers by blowing up the house's reactor. Camellia and Vesper fight off a few Citadel soldiers and Camellia realizes that they will never stop until they get her. Camellia leaves Vesper unconscious and allows the soldiers to take her. Before that, she tells Vesper that she has the seeds and that she can change the world with them.Deeply saddened, Vesper buries the altered seeds, believing there's no use for them in a world without her loved ones. But when a group of Jonas' kids find her, Vesper changes her mind. Vesper and the children journey to a makeshift tower built by the Pilgrims. There she finally takes the seeds out and lets the wind spread them."

In another flashback, a young Andy and his girlfriend Victoria ""Vicky"" Tomlinson talk to a doctor in a clinical trial, who explains to them that they will be injected with the experimental chemical drug Lot-6, which secretly gives them supernatural powers: Andy gains telepathy, and Vicky obtains telekinesis.In the present day, Charlie is sitting at the kitchen table after having a nightmare. Her parents join her and Charlie explains that she has been repressing something bad, her powers becoming more unstable. She unintentionally causes a ruckus at her school after exploding a bathroom stall due to anger at being bullied. Andy is shown using his power, ""the push"", to influence a client to stop smoking, although the strain causes his eyes to bleed.Meanwhile, in a secret facility, Captain Jane Hollister, leader of the Department of Scientific Intelligence (DSI), is monitoring thermal signatures caused by Charlie's outbursts. She visits Doctor Joseph Wanless, creator of Lot-6 and the resulting superhumans, who implores Hollister to terminate Charlie before her powers become uncontrollable. Hollister enlists fellow superhuman John Rainbird to assist her. Rainbird visits the McGee home, confronting Vicky, who attempts to counterattack with her repressed telekinetic powers. Rainbird kills her, holding Charlie at knifepoint as she and Andy enter the home. Charlie's powers overwhelm him and she sends a concussive burst of flames throughout the house.

After using the push to convince Irv to take them to Boston, they hitch a ride with him, stopping off at his house. After Charlie accidentally stumbles upon his paralyzed wife, Irv flies into a rage before conceding that he occasionally overreacts. Irv sits up all night watching a news report of the incident at the McGee home, which is being framed as murder by Andy. Irv and Andy argue before Andy explains to Irv that he is just trying to protect his daughter. Charlie tells Irv, after speaking telepathically with his wife, that she forgives him for the accident that left her paralyzed, causing him to relent and attempt to protect Andy and Charlie when the police appear due to his prior emergency call. Rainbird appears in the bushes, kills the policemen, and then shoots Irv in the knee before black trucks roll in to pick up Charlie and Andy. Andy uses his push to trick Rainbird so Charlie can escape to a forest. Charlie spends time honing her fire powers before stealing a bike and clothes to follow her father's telepathic message to her from his cell at DSI.Charlie finds DSI and takes an agent's pass card from him, then kills him after he draws his gun to attack her. She follows a large staircase down to the restricted area where her father is being kept. She reaches her father's glass-fronted cell, from inside which Hollister tells her not to try and burn her, lest she burn her father in the process. Andy tells Charlie that Rainbird, not he, telepathically called for her. Seeing no other way out, and knowing that he will die soon, he apologizes to her and then pushes her to burn the entire place down, starting with Hollister and himself. The now-rogue Charlie sets both on fire, mentally unlocks all the security doors, and walks through the facility killing all of the DSI agents. Rainbird is released when his holding cell is unlocked. Charlie is surrounded by men in hazmat suits, unable to harm them. The men are about to subdue her when Rainbird shoots them from behind. He surrenders to Charlie and kneels for her judgment. Charlie starts to kill him but sees herself in the mirror and, realizing that he is just as much of a pawn as her, she spares him, before finally burning the rest of the building down. Later, Charlie is seen walking onto a beach with Rainbird following behind. With nowhere to go, Charlie allows Rainbird to carry her, and they walk off together into the night. (thanks to Wikipedia)"

God's Crooked Lines,2022,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt13229894/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Follows a woman checking into a psychiatric ward to investigate a homicide. Alice, a private investigator, checks into a psychiatric hospital feigning paranoia with the goal of collecting evidence for the case she is working on: the death of an inmate in unclear circumstances. But the reality she faces in her confinement will exceed her expectations and cast doubt on her own sanity. An unknown and exciting world will open before her eyes.—Filmaffinity In 1979, Alice Gould De Almenara (Bárbara Lennie) enters a psychiatric ward. Left at the gates by a man, she is interrogated by Dr. Ruipérez (Federico Aguado), who reads a letter by Dr. Donadío (Lluís Soler). Donadío states that Alice has a penchant for telling lies and make them sound very convincing. Dr Alvar is the head of the institution and is on vacation.
Alice insists that she has been ""legally abducted"" by her husband Heliodoro (David Selvas) so he could seize her riches. Alice says that she has been married for 16 years. Heliodoro only plays poker and polo. Ruipérez claims that as per her file, she attempted to kill Heliodoro 3 times using a poison. She was caught by Heliodoro and Donadio sent her to the hospital. Alice refutes the charges, even though she has an advanced degree in chemistry and can prepare the poison.
Alice says that if she was reported to the police, the court would have appointed a guardian for her fortune, which is why Heliodoro conspired with Donadio to incarcerate Alice.Dr. Castell introduces the facility to Alice, who begins to do investigative fieldwork on the death of Dr. Raimundo García Del Olmo's (Joan Crosas) son Damián. Damian was at the mental institution and somebody killed him.
Alice (or Alicia) gets acquainted with Ignacio Urquieta (Pablo Derqui) and the twins (Rómulo (Samuel Soler) and Remo (Samuel Soler)) as well as the Gnome (Luis Sacristán), a sexual molester protected by the Elephant Man (Francisco Javier Pastor), who shows animosity towards Rómulo. Romulo imitates everyone at the facility and Remo doesn't speak at all.
Alice attends sessions by Dr. Arellano (Javier Beltrán). Alice claims that she has never been unfaithful to her husband. She is very fluent and erudite in her answers.
Alice uses one of her sessions to gain access to the bathroom, where she causes a leak of the toilet. This distracts the caretaker and Alice gain access to the archives room. She gets access to a list of patients on a particular day at the hospital. Urquieta's name is on the list and he was given permission to leave the hospital on the day Damian was murdered.Running along the primary time-line, a secondary time-line starts in a rainy night, in which a fire and riot take place and a corpse is found in one of the cells. A forensic doctor also comes into action and tries to recreate the steps leading up to the murder. Murder was performed using a shard of glass, but the glass came from the door of Alvar's office, which was many blocks away and has several locked doors in between. It seems the murderer caused the fire to auto-open the locks and divert everyone's attention while he performed the murder.
In this time-line Urquieta is incriminated by the cops as his hands are found smeared with blood. He is the only patient allowed to carry a lighter which could be used to start the fire. He is later cleared from suspicions as Urquieta fears water and the path to the shard of glass required passing through open passages exposed to the rain.In the main time-line, Urquieta is interrogated by Alicia whether if he suffers from schizophrenia, the condition Alice believes Damián's killer suffers from. It starts raining and it becomes evident that Urquieta suffers from an irrational fear of water.
Alice tells Urquieta that she is not paranoid and is a private detective who came to investigate Damian's death. Damian was at the hospital over a year ago and the doctors say he committed suicide. She suspects Damian's father's former patient, who wanted revenge in the worst possible way. According to Alice, Dr. Raimundo García Del Olmo was a doctor at the same facility earlier. Dr Alvar knows about Alice's mission at the facility, as Alvar was a friend of Dr. Raimundo García Del Olmo.
Urquieta later reveals that Damián was at odds with the Gnome.Alice follows Gnome into the forest after she sees him molesting a female patient. In the forest Alice finds Romulus, who says that Alice is their mother and will never leave them. Romulus is really protective of Alice.
Alicia is hit in the forest by the Gnome, waking up tied to a bed with Arellano telling her she is the presumed killer of the Gnome although she has trouble remembering what happened after the hit. She has memories of Gnome trying to molest her and then being attacked by someone.Alice personally meets Director Samuel Alvar (Eduard Fernández), claiming that she has already exchanged letters with him upon guidance from García Del Olmo so she could know how to enter the institution. Alvar denies this. Alicia attacks Alvar and tries to escape, only to be sedated.Alicia tells Castell her suspicions about Damián's murder and asks for a meeting of the medical council. Dr. Raimundo García Del Olmo himself Alice to the hospital on the day of her incarceration. Alvar claims that Alice has been interned upon recommendation by Donadío on behalf of Heliodoro.
She claims that she tricked Ruipérez at her first interview and feigned a mental illness to enter the facility. She had met Olmo at the new year gala and had seen news of Damian's death on TV. Heliodoro had told Olmo about Alice private investigative work. Olmo shows Alice a note addressed to Olmo which said ""You killed him, not me"". It was written by someone suffering from schizophrenia and was sent 2 days after Damian died. The patient who posted the latter had access to leave the facility as the letter from posted from a nearby town.How García Del Olmo gave her instructions that she should feign a condition of paranoia to be able to enter the facility and how they managed to get Donadío to attest her condition (which she did by talking to him) and Heliodoro to sign the permission to withhold her (she stacked the letter among a bunch of bank papers that he had to sign). She then told Heliodoro that she had to go to Argentina for work.
Alice blames Alvar for his liberal policies that led to a sexual predator like Gnome roaming freely and the death of Damian. Which is Why Alvar is afraid of calling the police.Alvar tells that Alice, offended because the man she chose to marry only wanted her money, tried to kill him by poisoning; Heliodoro, after recovering from a seizure, found Alice hiding poison; and knowing herself caught, she decided to fabricate a private investigator persona.
The other doctors insist that Alvar contact Donadio, Olmo and Heliodoro for confirmation of the facts.
Urquieta comes forward and says that in the forest Gnome was trying to force himself on Alice. When Urquieta reached there, Gnome tried to run away and tripped and cracked his head open.Heliodoro is not contactable and Alvar says that maybe Alice killed him before getting her admitted. Donadio is in a conference in Zurich.
After failing to identify a man whom Alvar identifies as García Del Olmo, Alice is Electro-shocked, and taken to the Cage, where she becomes convinced that she has been framed by Heliodoro, who hired someone to impersonate García Del Olmo.
She tells Arellano and Castell that in case her bank accounts are emptied there can be a plausible explanation for the behavior of Heliodoro, Donadío and Alvar. Castell says that Donadio would have received their telegram by now but has not responded.Castell confirms that Alvar has been overpaid by Heliodoro for Alice's internment. The amount paid for Alice is 20 times more than the regular fee for the other patients of the hospital. Alvar says that Heliodoro made a generous donation to the hospital. Alvar finds Castell snooping in his office and fires her.
Castell finds that Heliodoro's house has been empty for a long time.
Alicia escapes from her cell and develops a plan to light a fire while Urquieta frees the rest of patients. Urquieta finds one of the twins dead in a cell, it is becoming evident that the events of the secondary time-line pertain to the aftermath of Alice's plan.
Alicia crosses paths with the forensic doctor, who tells her about Rómulo's death. Alicia was at the gate of the facility and about to escape, but decides to go back in.
Alicia knocks her down and impersonates her. She cracks the identity of the twin's killer (the Elephant Man). Alicia says that Romulo killed Gnome and Urquieta was lying when he said Gnome died by accident. Elephant Man witnessed it. He killed Romulo for revenge.
Elephant man is found with his hands cut from the shard and bloodied. He is arrested.Cops confirm that Alice's account was emptied.
Castell convenes a meeting of the council to discharge Alice. Alice meets with the living twin and reveals that the dead one is actually Remo. Alvar renounces his vote, while the other four doctors clear Alice.
Alvar lets Donadío into the room. After the conference he went on vacation with his wife. He simply didn't receive any telegrams from the hospital.
To Alice's dismay, Donadío turns out to be the man she identified as García Del Olmo."

Mr. Harrigan's Phone,2022,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt12908110/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"When Mr. Harrigan dies, Craig, the teen who befriended and did odd jobs for him, puts his smart phone in his pocket before burial. When the lonely youth sends his dead friend a message, he is shocked to get a return text. Craig, a young boy living in a small town, befriends older, reclusive billionaire, Mr. Harrigan. The two form a bond over books and an iPhone, but when the man passes away, the boy discovers that not everything dead is gone, and finds himself able to communicate with his friend from the grave through the iPhone that was buried with him. In 2003, young Craig becomes acquainted with retired businessman John Harrigan following the death of his mother, with instructions to simply read to him three times a week. Five years later, a teenage Craig and elderly Harrigan have become friends.During this time, Craig starts high school and becomes close to Ms. Hart, a teacher who comes to his aid when Kenny Yankovich, a school bully, attempts to intimidate him. After winning $3,000 from a lottery ticket that Harrigan gave him and receiving his first iPhone for Christmas, Craig buys Harrigan one too. Despite initial resistance to new technology, he greatly enjoys the phone.The elderly Harrigan dies, leaving Craig heartbroken at the loss of his friend. At the funeral, Craig sneaks Harrigan's phone into the coffin. He is then informed by Harrigan's associate that he was left a bequest in Harrigan's will. Craig will receive $800,000 in a trust fund, to support his future studies and pursuit of a writing career, which he had told Harrigan about.Craig calls Harrigan's phone as a gesture of thanks. The next morning, he discovers that Harrigan sent him an odd text message, though his father chalks it up to being a bug within the iPhone itself.Life goes on for Craig, who goes to a dance with his crush, only to be attacked by Kenny, who accuses him of ratting out his drug-dealing activities on school grounds, getting him expelled. Later that night, Craig calls Harrigan's phone in a fit of frustration and sadness; he tells him what Kenny did and he is ""afraid that this won't end, and I wish that you were here just to give me some advice.""Kenny is found dead the next day, having apparently fallen from his bedroom window while attempting to sneak out. Scared by what happened, Craig goes to an Apple store, upgrades his phone to a newer model, and puts away his old one.Craig eventually graduates from high school and departs for college in Boston, to study journalism. While there, his father calls to tell him Ms. Hart was killed in a car accident involving a drunk driver, leaving her fiancé hospitalized. The driver, Dean Whitmore, is sent to rehab instead of prison for the accident although he'd been caught for drunk driving on other occasions, his license was suspended and he had an open container.Infuriated by the verdict, Craig returns to his room and uses his old phone to call Harrigan, explicitly wishing death on Whitmore. Craig later learns Whitmore was found dead in his shower. He drives to the rehab center and bribes a worker there to give him details about the suicide. He is told that Whitmore swallowed shampoo and a piece of broken soap bar. Craig is disturbed to learn that the soap is the same brand used by Ms. Hart, and Whitmore's suicide note is actually a lyric from the song ""Stand by Your Man"" by Tammy Wynette; Harrigan's ringtone.Craig breaks down and returns to his hometown. While there, he remembers opening Harrigan's ""secret closet"" (which he had refused to let Craig enter) after he passed, that it was actually a shrine to his deceased mother, so visits his gravestone, apologizing for his messages. He theorizes that Harrigan's odd text messages to him are his way of begging Craig to let his spirit rest in peace and for him to move forward in the here and now.As he leaves Harrigan's grave, Craig visits his own mother's and collapses in tears, begging for forgiveness. He then rushes to the town quarry, contemplating the water while standing very near the edge before throwing his phone into the water. As Craig walks away, he quietly narrates that when he himself passes on and is buried, he wants his pockets to be empty. (thanks to Wikipedia)"

Narvik: Hitler's First Defeat,2022,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9737876/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"April 1940. The eyes of the world are on Narvik, a small town in northern Norway, source of the iron ore needed for Hitler's war machinery. Through two months of fierce winter warfare, Hitler is dealt his first defeat. Norway had declared its neutrality during World War II, but it was ignored. The iron ore bought by the Germans from Sweden (85% of the total German consumption) for making weapons was transported by train to Narvik and shipped out of its port to Germany. Stopping the German ships before they could transport the ore from the port became crucial for Great Britain. They firmly believed that would weaken their enemy.
The enemy countries started attacking each other's ships (Britain lays ship mines all around the Norwegian waters in 1940), and Norway was dragged into the mess. The Norwegian army was poorly armed when the Germans entered their land. Since they were not equipped with high-end machine guns like the Germans, they aimed to defeat them by cutting off the iron ore supply.Corporel Gunnar Tofte (Carl Martin Eggesbø) looked forward to returning to Narvik to celebrate his son's birthday. Upon returning, he was told that all the leaves were canceled, and he needed to head to the base. Disheartened, Gunnar tried to convince Major Sigurd Omdal (Henrik Mestad) to allow him to return home. He was permitted to leave, but on the condition that he would get back to the base by midnight. Gunnar was elated. He handed over his belongings to his friends and headed home with a gift in his hand. His wife, Ingrid (Kristine Hartgen), worked at a hotel as a staff member and translator. She translated the meeting held by the mayor of Narvik for the German representatives. He demanded respect for Norway's neutral stance from both Germany and Great Britain. While translating the mayor's speech, Ingrid's eyes caught a glimpse of her husband. She could not contain her happiness and rushed to the kitchen when the meeting ended. Gunnar and Ingrid were overjoyed to be finally together, and even though he had to leave by midnight, she felt comforted knowing he was going to be around.Their house was located just beyond the hotel's backyard, where Gunnar found his little boy spending time with his grandfather. The sight of a toy train cheered little Ole (Christoph Gelfert Mathiesen), and his father Aslak was pleased to see him return home safe. While Ingrid worked at the hotel, Gunnar helped Ole build a little town for his toy train. After making love, Ingrid and Gunnar woke up to the noise of explosions. Gunnar rushed to the base and learned that the Germans had started to invade the town. The Norwegian soldiers backed off from attacking the German troops at Major Omdal's command. He refused to engage with them, knowing that it would lead to a massive bloodbath and loss of the entire town to bomb shells. Instead, he asked his soldiers to follow him to plan an attack that would be effective in driving the Germans out of Narvik.Meanwhile, Ingrid continued to maintain her calm at her job. She had reasons to hate the Germans, but she continued providing her hospitable service to them. She believed it was her job to cater to the guests of the hotel. The Germans want to arrest the British staying at the hotel. While she maintained a pleasant relationship with the Germans, she helped the English representatives escape safely. She could not offer to have them stay at her place, so she instead asked them to hide in the forest cabin. She knew that the Englishmen could help their country defeat Germany, and she wanted to do her part in assisting them. Since the situation was getting out of hand, she decided to escape from Norway with her son. Aslak (Stig Henrik Hoff) helped them safely board a train to Sweden. While Gunnar planned to bomb the railway bridge, he was unaware that his own family would be traveling through the Nordal bridge.The Norwegian company, under the leadership of Major Omdal, intended to destroy the Nordal bridge. The rail line was used to bring iron ore from Sweden to Narvik, and the only way to stop the Germans from occupying Narvik was by destroying the entire link. Gunnar had worked on the Ofoten lines, and he was called upon to find the dynamite located in them. The bridge was built to be blown up, and finding the dynamite was crucial for the success of their plan. He sought Aslak's help to locate the dynamite, and during their conversation, he informed Gunnar that Ingrid and Ole were traveling in a train that would pass through the bridge. After receiving the information, Gunnar was hesitant to go ahead with the plan. Soon he noticed civilians walking on the bridge, and he found Ingrid and Ole among the crowd. He learned that the Germans forced the Norwegians to evacuate the train, and they were compelled to walk the remaining path. Gunnar encouraged Ingrid and Ole to walk through the tunnel to cross the border while he completed the mission. He worked around the bridge to set the dynamite. When the Germans started firing, the dynamite was ignited, but Gunnar did not have time to escape. He hurriedly jumped off the bridge into the snow but was soon captured by the Germans. The soldiers were successful in blowing off the bridge, though Gunnar's future seemed uncertain.Ingrid and Ole were directed back to their house by the German soldiers who had managed to cross the bridge before it blew up. Ingrid's ability to speak the language helped her build a friendly relationship with the enemy. She was personally called by Consul Wessow (Christoph Bach) to help him with translation during his discussion with the Narvik mayor. The Germans were confident that the English would not set foot in Narvik since they had invaded the land. While the mayor was worried about the fate of his people, the Germans wanted him to continue running the town as usual. After the mayor and the German officials left, Consul Wessow inquired about the reason behind Ingrid's tense face. She expressed that her husband was involved in bombing the bridge and was captured by the Germans. Wessow promised to have a word with the director to emphasize the importance of Ingrid's contribution.
While Ingrid showed her vulnerability to the Germans, she continued to meet with the English consul. The English consul wanted to use Ingrid's relationship with the German consul to find out the maps of German artillery positions hidden in the town. They needed it to plan their defense against Germany. Ingrid was caught between the two countries. As a wife and a mother, she only cared about saving her family, and she was ready to win favors on both ends. She noticed the place where the maps were kept, but before she could take any steps, the English bombed the German fleets. She escaped with her family and moved to the secret tunnel with the rest of the town. She later went to the hotel to continue with her duties and asked Consul Wessow about Gunnar. He refused to help her, considering the Germans were under immense pressure after the fleet attack. Ingrid now had even more reasons to risk her life in order to obtain the maps. She got hold of the maps and brought them to the Englishmen. The Englishmen couldn't thank her enough for her bravery. The town was bombed when she returned home. Her house was completely destroyed. Aslak lost his life in the bombing. Ingrid was relieved when she found her son under the ruin and took him to the tunnel.Meanwhile, the French and Polish troops attacked from the north and south, weakening the grip of the Germans. Gunnar (who was being used as a human mule to transport supplies to the German troops entrenched in the mountains around Narvik), with the help of the French troops, managed to murder the Germans who kidnapped him. He was united with his company, though the thought of losing his son made him restless. He was desperate to return to Narvik, to his home, and to his family. Ingrid and Ole now lived in the tunnel. The Germans were aware that someone had helped the English with intelligence on which buildings to bomb exactly in the city, and Wessow was searching for the English consul. He explained that the only way to stop Narvik from destroying the country further was by pushing the English out of it. Ole was injured during the bombing, and his wound had not healed. One night, when Ole's body temperature was extremely high, and he had stopped responding, Ingrid took him to the hotel to seek help from the German consul. He refused to call the doctor since there were several wounded German soldiers who needed his attention. Desperate to win the consul's favor, Ingrid disclosed the location of the English consul. Ole was operated on, and his life was saved. In order to save Ole's life, Ingrid becomes a traitor to her people. Every Norwegian in Narvik looked down upon her.The French and Norwegian armies proceeded to reclaim Narvik, and Gunnar was assigned the task of destroying the cannon. Even though the Norwegian army was terrified by the Germans' massive use of machine guns, their major encouraged them to keep fighting. Gunnar found another route to attack the Germans, and it turned out to be a success. The French and Norwegian troops took over the hill and pulled down the Nazi flag. While Gunnar celebrated the win with fellow army men, Consul Wessow informed Ingrid that her husband had passed away. He showed her the list of prisoners of war, and Gunnar's name was scratched off. The German consul wanted to take Ingrid along with him to Berlin since he knew that his country was preparing to air raid Narvik, but she was too consumed by the news to process his request. She was advised by her colleague Polly to leave Narvik with her son.Ingrid and Ole went to their ruined home to collect whatever little remained. Ingrid was startled when she saw Gunnar standing at the door. It was the most unexpected reunion, and Gunnar had many doubts to clear. After reaching Narvik, he learns about Ingrid's betrayal of the nation, and he wants her to explain to him the truth. Ingrid had no remorse for what she did; after all, she did what she had to do to protect her son. She could not let Ole die when she knew there was a way to save him, even if that meant going against the interests of her country. Gunnar looked down at Ingrid just like the rest of the town. The Germans started air raiding the town, and Ingrid decided to leave with her son. Gunnar joined his troop while he watched his family leave. He was moved when Major Omdal asked the soldiers to fight for everything they held dear. Watching his family leave, Gunnar had lost all motivation to fight anymore. The English had left, the French were heading to defend their country, and the Norwegian army was left alone to defend themselves. Gunnar did not care about heroism; all he wanted was to be with his family. He headed to the ferry and joined his family as they left the country.Norway's strategic geographic location piqued the interest of both Great Britain and Germany. They pressured Norway's strict neutrality and aimed at invading the land. Germany and Britain headed to Norway to occupy it, but Germany managed to get there first. Because Narvik was a port town and the primary outlet for Swedish ore, controlling it became critical. While the Germans were successful on land, the British Naval Force took command at sea. The Norwegian troops further posed a danger to the Germans as they destroyed the Nordal bridge. But even after all the setbacks, the Germans held on. The British and French troops retracted since the events in France gained precedence. On June 8th, 1940, the Norwegian army was forced to lay down their weapons. The English and the French withdrew from Narvik without consulting the Norwegian government. The war of Narvik is considered Hitler's first defeat, even though it was for a brief period of time."

A 12 year old boy grows up in an American neighbourhood with dreams of becoming an artist. His father does not approve but he finds solace in the encouraging words of his grandfather and the friendship with his classmate keeps him happy. As time moves on in his life's journey the good, bad and indifferent experiences continue to educate and fascinate him.—madanmarwah From Wikipedia:In 1980 Queens, New York City, on his first day in sixth grade, Jewish-American Paul Graff becomes friends with a rebellious African-American classmate named Johnny. Johnny was held back by a year and gets harsher treatment from their teacher when they both joke around in class. Paul often disassociates from his schoolwork and draws pictures instead.Paul lives with his financially stable family of Jewish heritage. He is close with his maternal grandfather Aaron Rabinowitz, who encourages him to pursue his aspirations of becoming an artist. His well-meaning but strict parents, Esther and Irving, are less convinced by Paul's career prospects to be an artist. At night, Aaron tells Paul the story of how Aaron's mother escaped antisemitic persecution in Ukraine, fleeing to London before eventually immigrating to the United States with Aaron and her British husband.One day, Paul and Johnny are caught smoking a joint in the restrooms, unaware that it's an illegal drug. Furious, Esther allows Irving to beat Paul as punishment. In the hope that he becomes more disciplined, Paul is sent to the Forest Manor Prep private school by his parents,[5] where his older brother Ted is studying. Meanwhile, Johnny stops going to public school following Paul's expulsion.Forest Manor is financially supported by famous businessman Fred Trump, who also supports Ronald Reagan in the upcoming US presidential election. Many of the students are also Reagan supporters. On Paul's first day, Fred's daughter Maryanne, one of the school's famous alumni, delivers a speech to the students about working to earn their success. Paul sees the school's advantages over his previous schooling but still doesn't feel welcome at the school. Paul is also unnerved by racist comments from other students when Johnny meets with him during playtime outdoors. Johnny also begins living in secret at Paul's clubhouse, having nowhere to go other than living with his sick grandmother, where foster system workers searching for Johnny have begun to visit regularly.While playing at the park on the weekend, Paul tells Aaron of his struggles at school and how he does nothing when he witnesses racism from the other students. Aaron encourages Paul to stand up against prejudice when he sees it; reminding Paul that while antisemitism still covertly persists, he and his family still have the privilege of being white. Shortly after, Aaron dies of bone cancer, with the family mourning his loss.Tired of living under high expectations from family and school, as well as the unfair treatment of Johnny, Paul convinces Johnny of his plan to steal a computer from school and sell it for money, so they can run away together. Although they successfully steal the computer, they are arrested by the police for trying to sell it. While being interrogated, Paul confesses that it was all his plan, to protect Johnny. However, knowing that he has no options in life, Johnny takes the blame to let Paul go, much to Paul's dismay. Paul and Johnny bid farewell, as Irving arrives to take him home with no consequences due to an officer being an old friend of Irving's. At home, Irving confesses to Paul that he is sympathetic to his frustration with America's unfair racial inequality, but tells him that they need to survive to have a good life. The two agree to not tell Esther what happened, as she is still mourning the loss of her father.Days later, the Graff family are disappointed by Reagan's victory in the election, while Paul is focused on schoolwork. During a Thanksgiving dance at school, Fred Trump addresses the students, expressing hope that they'll become the next successful elite. A disillusioned Paul leaves the event during the speech"

He throws Teddy off the ledge, but he catches onto a decoration. Toronto and Miami fight as Teddy attempts to get himself down.

Toronto explains that he was supposed to kill a man who owed gambling debts to the wrong people, but he stopped himself when he saw the man's kid. Toronto later regretted it because the man went on to commit a rampage. He says that when he finishes this job, he wants to open up his own restaurant and not kill anymore.At the hotel, Marin and Daniela meet with The Handler and Miami.

Entergalactic,2022,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10687116/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Jabari, a charming, streetwear-clad artist on the cusp of real success. After a chance run-in with his cool new photographer neighbor, Meadow, Jabari has to figure out whether he can make space for love in his life. Jabari (Kid Cudi). He has recently moved into a swanky apartment in Manhattan after being hired by Cosmic Comics to turn his original character, Mr. Rager (Keith David), into a comic book series. Soon after that, he runs into his ex-girlfriend, Carmen (Laura Harrier). And despite being warned against hooking up with her by his friends, Ky (Ty Dolla $ign) and Jimmy (Timothée Chalamet), he goes ahead with it. Stush is a dating app. And Jabari makes fun of Carmen for being on Stush.
The following day, he realizes that he doesn't have any space for a steady relationship in this new life yet and requests Carmen to just be friends with him. That said, when he runs into his neighbor, Meadow (Jessica Williams), after being awoken by her loud music, he experiences what's known as ""love at first sight."" Meadow is a photographer.
Mr Rager is a dark character and Jabari is struggling to find inspiration to create an entire comic book series around the character. Jabari's coworker Len (Arturo Castro) suggests that Jabari considers a lighter and whiter look for the Mr Rager character.Although it's evident from the get-go that Jabari and Meadow are madly in love with each other, they take their merry time, cementing the fact that they are, in fact, a couple. Meadow takes Jabari to her secret spot, a little restaurant with a great burger. Meadow's work will be showcased at a museum in a month from now.
Ky warns Jabari not to date his neighbor. Ky dated his neighbor once, and she turned out to be a Russian hacker and was pursued by the ICE agents.
Reed (Christopher Abbott) is Meadow's agent and is rumored to be ""well endowed"".After their first date, they accidentally meet at a human reproductive system-themed party and bail out of there. Reed had taken Meadow there as she would meet her prospective clients.
Going by the magical nature of their bike ride back home, that's when Meadow realizes that she's in love with Jabari. But it's only after some persuasion from Karina (Vanessa Hudgens), i.e., Meadow's best friend, and from Ky and Jimmy, that the neighbors finally take the plunge into a whirlwind romance. Things go rather smoothly because it's the ""honeymoon period."" They go on vacation together. The sex is good. They meet each other's friends. However, one night, a little misunderstanding in the form of Carmen creeps into Jabari and Meadow's lives.Upon noticing that Jabari's phone is buzzing, Meadow unlocks it and sees that Carmen has sent a photo of herself wearing nothing but Jabari's red hoodie, along with the messages ""you left this here yesterday"" and ""some things always fit."" We get a flashback that Jabari went to Carmen to get rid of a rat in her house. While dealing with it, he took off his hoodie. But after running out of the house due to the enormity of the rat, Jabari never came back to retrieve the hoodie. Hence the picture.
As Meadow starts to cold shoulder Jabari, he goes back to Carmen's to not only get the hoodie, but also to clear it out that they aren't ""friends with benefits."" They are strictly friends because Jabari is in a relationship with Meadow. With that out of the way, Jabari heads over to Meadow's to clear things up with her. However, since she isn't in the mood to listen and Jabari isn't very good at explaining, they end up putting a pause on their relationship.Post their breakup, both Jabari and Meadow dive headfirst into their work. While Meadow prepares for her art presentation, Jabari prepares his demonstration for the Mr. Rager comic. But their personal lives begin to suck. They even avoid running into each other.
When Jabari's comic gets green-lit, he types in the message to inform Meadow but doesn't hit ""send."" One of the artists who is co-presenting with Meadow, Nadia (070 Shake), lauds her for the picture of Jabari she had snapped. However, Meadow says that that portrait isn't going to be in the presentation because it doesn't have a place there. That's literal and metaphorical in nature because Meadow isn't sure if she can accommodate Jabari, someone who she doesn't trust right now, in her life anymore. And it's literal because, subconsciously, Meadow has composed her presentation in a way that the picture of Jabari just won't fit anywhere.Jabari's sister Ellie (Maisha Mescudi) pays him a visit to knock some sense into him. She tells him that he shouldn't let his pride get in the way of trying hard enough to win Meadow's trust back. Then, she basically spells out the ethos of ""Entergalactic"" by saying: ""Love is the easiest thing in the world when it happens by accident, but it doesn't get real until you do it on purpose."" Jabari and Meadow live beside each other by chance. They ran into each other by chance. And their personalities match with each other by chance. But the moment they have to put some real effort into ensuring they've got a future together, they are cutting and running. Yes, you can say that Meadow isn't as much at fault as Jabari is because his inability to draw lines caused this whole misunderstanding. Jabari should've realized that and made more of an effort to make amends.Ellie manages to motivate Jabari to not only attend Meadow's presentation but also make a grand gesture by turning the nearby McDonald's poster into a Mr. Rager street art. Meadow sees that and understands that Jabari is telling her to meet him at her secret spot, The Greasy Spoon. Jabari cycles to the restaurant while Meadow takes a cab. After reaching there, they make out and become a couple again. A news reporter informs us that the dating app, Stush, which looms heavily over the movie, has been accused of defrauding its customers by acquiring their credit card details."

When an injured player from the A-team is selected to play with the Bs as part of his recovery, tensions are already high. Initial suspicion turns to physical lust for two of the team members and personal loyalties are stretched as they try to conceal the affair, not only from their own partners but also their teammates.

Hard drinking and macho antics are par for the course amongst the team, but these bulky athletes soon reveal their vulnerabilities.

Prepare yourself for a muddy, sweat-drenched emotional thrill ride.—Brian Robinson Minute for minute, you won't find a more handsome-packed film this year than British rugby drama In from the Side, a surprisingly moving sports-team story slathered in sweat, streaked with mud, and dripping with sexuality.

While hiding behind a police station that is under construction, he sees Vijay emerging from it. David later attempts to escape town with his wife and son but gets arrested.Seven years later, Vijay, Nandini, Anju, and Anu are living contentedly. Vijay is now a prosperous businessman who owns a movie theatre and still operates a cable company. He aspires to make a film of his own and is in frequent contact with screenwriter Murad Ali to develop the script. Anju, on the other hand, is a PTSD patient and has recurring episodes of epilepsy, as a result of her involvement in Sam's death. Jealous of the family's rise in wealth, a number of locals have resorted to spreading rumors about Anju being in a relationship with Sam, much to Nandini's distress. Her only confidante is her friendly neighbor, Jenny, who is often abused by her alcoholic husband, Shiv.On Sam's death anniversary, Vijay has an encounter with Sam's father Mahesh, who vainly begs him to disclose the location of his son's remains. Meanwhile, Nandini spends more time with Jenny and inadvertently discloses that Anju killed Sam. Unknown to her, Jenny and Shiv are married undercover cops, assigned by Inspector-general of police Tarun Ahlawat, who is a close friend and colleague of Meera.At the same time, David is released from prison. After struggling to reconcile with his now-estranged wife, he yearns to find employment. While coming to know that Vijay's case is still ongoing, he recalls the latter's presence at the then-under-construction police station and realizes that Vijay was indeed complicit in the murder. He tips Tarun, who summons Meera and Mahesh from London. After the trio bribes him, David divulges what he saw, leading to the newly-built police station being excavated. The police eventually find a skeleton. Vijay, having noticed this through his CCTV cameras which he had installed around the police station, seemingly gives up.Tarun summons Vijay's for questioning. While Vijay, Nandini, Anu, and Anju manage to maintain their alibi; Meera reveals a voice recording of Nandini's earlier confession to Jenny; the police bugged the family residence earlier, exposing the family. Gaitonde thrashes Vijay's family, causing Anju to have one of her fits. A distraught Vijay falsely confesses that he killed Sam. With the police satisfied, the family are let go, and Vijay gets arrested and placed on trial for Sam's murder, although Meera isn't satisfied and demands that Vijay's family be punished as well.Having learnt of Vijay's arrest, Murad visits Tarun, Meera, and Mahesh. He reveals that during one of his encounters with Vijay, the latter had fabricated a script for a future crime thriller, loosely based on Sam's murder. He says that the script had been turned into a novel titled Drishyam, although it was published under Murad's name for copyright protection. Vijay pleads not guilty, with his lawyer claiming that the police used Drishyam's plot as a means to frame him. Furthermore, the judge reveals that the DNA tests conducted on the skeleton do not match Sam's DNA, much to everyone's shock. Murad reveals that Vijay had fabricated an alternate climax for his film in which the hero, knowing his initial plan might fail, would procure the remains of another person of the same age and sex who had died of similar injuries to those of the villain, by befriending the gravedigger at the local cemetery. The hero would keep the skeletal remains with him for three years before befriending the security guard of the district medical college morgue under the pretext of promising him a role in his film. The same night they were excavated from the police station and arrived at the morgue, the hero would swap the bodies before the DNA analysis takes place.Vijay is released on bail due to a lack of evidence, and the police are prohibited from investigating the family. The judge calls Tarun to his chambers and tells him to end all investigations against Vijay and his family, as he believes both families deserve justice, but the legal system is unable to provide it to them. The judge also tells him that such cases are not new to the system. Outside the courthouse, Murad discloses to Meera and Mahesh that Vijay's alternative climax had a twist in which the hero would hand over the villain's cremated remains to the bereaved parents. Simultaneously, Vijay has Sam's cremated remains anonymously handed over to Meera and Mahesh.Mahesh immerses Sam's remains and persuades Meera to let go of her enmity towards Vijay, as he believes they have found closure and believes Vijay would do anything to protect his family. Vijay, who was watching from afar, solemnly leaves."

The Bubble,2022,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt13610562/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A group of actors and actresses stuck inside a pandemic bubble at a hotel attempt to complete a film. Following a problematic film role that nearly destroyed her career, actress Carol Cobb (Karen Gillan) is given the opportunity to revive her reputation by reluctantly reprising her role as the heroic Dr. Lacey Nightingale in the sixth installment of the wildly popular Cliff Beasts franchise: Cliff Beasts 6: Battle for Everest: Memories of a Requiem. Carol had turned down appearing in the fifth film in favor of doing the aforementioned panned role, and she fears that her former Cliff Beasts cast-mates may hold a grudge against her for abandoning them and the franchise. She is forced to take the role as her previous film bombed, where she played a half Israeli, half Palestinian, fighting aliens.Paula (Kate McKinnon), the studio executive overseeing the Cliff Beasts franchise (who is holidaying at a ski resort, while the shoot is on). Gavin (Peter Serafinowicz), executive producer of the Cliff Beasts franchise. Scott Dawson (Nick Kocher), the behind-the-scenes stills photographer. Bola (Samson Kayo), the cast coordinator. Gunther (Harry Trevaldwyn), the awkward COVID safety officer. Gavin reports to Paula, who reports to Tom (John Lithgow), the studio chairman.
Ronjon (Vir Das), the owner of the hotel playing host to the Cliff Beasts 6 cast and crew.One of the first major film productions to begin shooting in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Cliff Beasts cast arrive at a swanky English hotel and must self-quarantine for two weeks prior to the shoot. During these two weeks, Carol slowly loses her sanity being stuck in her room. After this period is over, a welcome back party is organized for the cast and crew. Here, Carol happily reunites with co-stars Dustin (David Duchovny) (the workaholic lead of the Cliff Beasts franchise who portrays the character Dr. Hal Packard), Howie (Guz Khan) (an actor who portrays Jarrar, the comic relief character) and Sean (Keegan-Michael Key) (an actor who portrays the Cliff Beasts character Colt Rockwell and promotes himself as a wellness guru when not on-camera) but has an awkward meeting with Lauren (Leslie Mann) (an actress who portrays a Cliff Beasts fan favorite character named Dolly), the only Cliff Beasts co-star that appears bitter after Carol's abandonment.The party also welcomes two series newcomers, Dieter ((Pedro Pascal) a serious veteran actor portraying a new character and tragic villain named Gio), a respected, but indifferent veteran actor, and Krysta (Iris Apatow) (a TikTok superstar who joins the Cliff Beasts 6 cast as the character Vivian Joy), a young TikTok sensation brought in to attract a younger demographic. The latter quickly forms an alliance with Carla (Galen Hopper) (the daughter of the stunt coordinator and Gavin's production assistant), a deadpan on-set production assistant who's around her age.Director Darren Eigan (Fred Armisen) (a former indie filmmaker hired to direct Cliff Beasts 6), an enthusiastic, but frazzled indie filmmaker tries to boost team morale and make the shoot something special but comes off as pretentious. Darren clashes with leading man Dustin, who constantly bombards Darren with revised versions of the film's script to fit his own vision. Dieter harbors a crush on Anika (Maria Bakalova), the hotel's sweet front desk clerk, and hits on her. She responds that she's interested but wants to build a proper relationship with him first before jumping into sex.
As Dieter gets more and more starved for sex, he proceeds to have intercourse with Kate (Daisy Ridley), an exercise AI after a drug binge.Shooting begins and for the first few days, everything appears to be going according to plan. Sean humorously learns to fly a helicopter up and down. However, a rocky series of events occur that repeatedly delay the production even further. During a group meditation session, Howie succumbs to paranoia and quits the film in a panic. As a result, Howie's Cliff Beasts character is killed off in a gruesome display. Bored in the hotel, Krystal and Carla sneak out and go partying in the city. This gains traction online and gets Krystal canceled for her behavior, losing her a large portion of followers.Later the cast tests positive for influenza, linked to a delivery girl who had brought them all their coffee. Despite their sicknesses, the studio forces them to film, leading to them all violently vomiting during an intense shoot. The cast is told to self-quarantine yet again. Introduced is the mysterious Mr. Best (Ross Lee), who claims to be the head of a new security team sent by the studio to watch over the cast and the film's production. Best installs location detectors on all crew to keep an eye on their movements.Day 61. While in the hotel, Carol's boyfriend breaks up with her over the phone. A dejected Carol ends up encountering a handsome member of a football team who's residing at the hotel. Carol nearly has a fling with him before he reveals he's married and that he already has multiple girlfriends and mistresses. Infuriated, Carol tries to rally together her cast-mates and fight for their rights as workers, as they are being forced to work during illness.
Day 94. When the shoot starts back up again, Carol realizes that almost all of her character's dialogue and actions have been either given to Krystal or omitted. Humiliated after shooting a scene where Dr. Lacey urinates in fear, Carol suspects this is the studio's way of getting back at her for leaving the franchise, and for complaining to the studio. Carol has a heart-to-heart with Darren (in the swimming pool, where he tries to come on to her) and tells him of her concerns, Darren promises to talk to the higher-ups about giving Carol her dialogue back but this backfires.Lauren tries to escape from the hotel in a frenzy one night, after a fight with Dustin. Mr. Best's men graphically shoot one of her hands off, leaving her in the hospital for the remainder of the shoot. Mr. Best claims that his men thought Lauren was a crazed fan that had wandered onto the premises, but the cast theorizes that Mr. Best himself is the crazed fan who wants them to complete the movie by any means necessary.
Carol speaks to her agent Marti (Rob Delaney), and says that the studio is mistreating the actors and this way they would be shooting the movie forever. Marti counters that as per contract she needs to complete the movie or she would owe the studio 114 MM dollars.
Darren announces that after completing Cliff Beasts 6, the cast will roll right into shooting Cliff Beast 7. Krystal helps Carol shoot a video message to all her fans on TikTok, but Carla intervenes and deletes the video, saying that Carol sounds like a whining celebrity, which is not what the world wants.One night, the remaining cast take drugs together and bond over the grievances they've been having not only with the shoot but also with themselves. Shortly afterwards, they film an elaborate dancing TikTok with Krystal. During this Dieter collapses due to the drugs. The cast quickly works together in an attempt to revive him but to no avail. However, Anika manages to revive him, cementing their relationship. This event inspires Carol, noticing the cast's long-forgotten effective teamwork. The reinvigorated friendship proves strong and they organize a getaway plan. As they shoot the climax, Dustin creates a distraction by clashing with Darren about the script revisions while the rest of the cast members leave the set and try to avoid getting caught by Mr. Best and his men.Carla reveals she was a studio mole put in place to befriend Krystal and spy on the cast, leading to a live-streamed fistfight between the two girls. Meanwhile, Carol is chased down and nearly caught by a relentless Mr. Best but is saved at the last moment when Howie returns and incapacitates Mr. Best with a bow. The cast meets up at the helipad, calling upon an unsure Sean to fly them out. A furious Darren tries to stop them from leaving, only to be knocked out by Dustin. Inside the helicopter, they find Anika, who hopes to run away with Dieter, an offer he happily accepts. Sean is able to get the helicopter up off the ground but doesn't know how to fly it forward. With encouragement from the rest of the crew ( a YouTube video from Krystal), Sean successfully flies the helicopter away from the hotel as the Cliff Beasts cast celebrate their victory.Two years later, a behind the scenes documentary detailing the troubled production and crazy antics on the set entitled Beasts of the Bubble is released to rave reviews and praise from the public. While Carol is described as ""the villain"" of the film, she's proud of the project. Dieter and Anika's relationship is still strong. Lauren is seen to be in good spirits, having been fitted with a robotic hand. Meanwhile, Darren is signed on to direct a movie based on Skittles candy."

""Some things are beyond repair."" The In Between (2022) by writer, Marc Klein, is a supernatural Love Story about an aspiring photographer, ""Tessa"" (Joey King) desperately trying to make contact with ""Skylar"" (Kyle Allen), the boyfriend who died in a car accident (and seems to be trying to get her attention). Via poignant time-line clips, the story follows the grief-stricken Tessa on a backwards journey of reflection from waking up in the hospital (after the accident) to replaying memories of their sweet summer romance. Throughout all this, Skylar's persistent and obvious attempts to let Tessa know he's near, gradually succeed in crossing the line between heaven and earth and into a desperate embrace with the woman he loves and misses. It's a little scary and intense, but this is the moment Tessa has been hoping for. She and Skylar are once again together-Tessa being in a coma--and she must now choose between life on earth and spending eternity with Skylar. What we also see in this heartfelt and suspenseful romance is a masterful execution of romance-film conventions that pull us into the intimate bonding stages of this believable and budding relationship, while subtly tugging at our own emotions and beliefs of the afterlife. It's clever how Tessa's photography-which she never thinks is good enough for others to see--is cleverly woven as both the film's romantic motif as well as Tessa's other passion for living. And though the ending may seem predictable, the narrative has enough emotional twists and turns to make you guess otherwise.—T.B.

The burden weighs heavy on his conscience.While he goes to a press conference about Janine's murder, he meets her sister - Vanessa (Eloise Smyth), who comes there from England to get to the bottom of the case. She asks David to help her with the same when he is left with no other option but to give empty promises. On the other side, David and Robert become more and more distant due to their different viewpoints. David feels that the truth will come out sooner or later, and Robert suggests lying about the night when they left the pub and returned by tram. He also advises claiming his car (that has a bump due to the incident) was stolen, while he sinks into a water body.During the emotional drift between these two neighbors, Vanessa and David get emotionally closer. Their romantic interest enrages Robert, thinking that it would make it difficult for them to hide their crime. Meanwhile, Grant speaks with David about Robert, who he always considered to be a bit strange. While that opinion impacts his judgment about this neighbor, his violent acts out of jealousy about Vanessa being closer to him, make him despise the person. When the couple decides to go kayaking, he shows up there as a surprise and tries to kill her.Sometime later, the police officers show up at David's house when he was with Vanessa. They mention a call by him which he notes to be a mistake. It makes Vanessa realize that he knew Janine from before but did not utter a word about it. While she becomes enraged, he mentions not knowing that he did not know that it was Janine who got killed that day. Her suspicion of David's involvement gets even bigger when she finds out that he lied about his return journey. While he mentioned returning by tram late at night, the last one is at 10:30 PM.She then goes back to David's place to confront him about it. He is not home, and she meets Robert. During their conversation, he realizes that she knows their secret, and he strangles her. When David returns home, Robert welcomes him and shares a tour ticket for him to leave the place for a while. He calls it a friendly gesture, but it ends up making him more frustrated. Right after Robert returns to his place, David calls Vanessa's number wanting to tell her about her sister. However, Robert, who strangled Vanessa earlier, has her phone and cuts that call. He realizes that David is eventually going to convict himself of the crime.When David goes to his office, a colleague informs him that their meeting is canceled since she could not get hold of Grant on the phone. He goes to Grant's office, sees a gift basket on his basket, and realizes Robert giving it to him. He rushes out to Vanessa's place but cannot get in touch with her. That's when he receives a call from her, and Robert starts speaking. He mentions that she is with him. He mentions planning to take her fishing. So, David realizes Robert's ill intentions and drives back to his home as fast as he can.Meanwhile, Robert tells Vanessa that it was he who convinced David that Janine was dead that night and made him run away. The reason why he went through all this trouble is that he saw David as a brother he never had and did not want to lose the bond they had built. By the time David reaches home, Robert already hits her so hard that she dies. While David confronts him, Robert keeps mentioning doing everything for him. He keeps asking for forgiveness when David walks out with a weapon in his hand.That is when the police show up at this place and arrest David. They convict him in all these crimes and Robert shows himself as an innocent person. The police then tell him that Vanessa's alive. The police reached there at the time because Robert called them before. So, it was his plan to save himself from conviction. However, upon learning of Vanessa, he realizes that she would tell the truth about him.When the ambulance takes her away, David overhears her pulse is stable. He smiles taking it as a sign of him being proven not guilty. On the other side, Robert sinks himself in the same lake, tied to the anchor - the same image that we see in the opening shot. Unlike David, who had a conflict of conscience, Robert does not show an iota of remorse, and his psychopathic tendencies are revealed slowly over the period. (thanks to highonfilms)"

Interceptor,2022,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14174940/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"One Army captain must use her years of tactical training and military expertise when a simultaneous coordinated attack threatens the remote missile interceptor station she is in command of. The tough and reality-bruised Captain JJ Collins (Elsa Pataky) finds herself in charge of a lone nuclear missile interceptor base in the middle of the Pacific Ocean after she is wrongfully drummed out of her dream job at the Pentagon. When a simultaneous coordinated attack then threatens the base itself, Collins comes face-to-face with the charismatic yet crooked Alexander Kessel (Luke Bracey), a former US military intelligence officer intent on carrying out an unthinkable plan. With only minutes on the clock, Collins must utilize her years of tactical training and military expertise to determine who she can trust and stop Kessel and his covert mercenaries from completing their twisted and terrible mission. The United States has two interceptor launch sites aimed at intercepting any nuclear warhead launches; the first, Fort Greely in Alaska, is attacked by unknown assailants presumably affiliated with a terrorist faction, while 16 nuclear warheads are simultaneously seized from Russian territory. The second site is a remote platform in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. U.S. Army Captain J. J. Collins is recently reassigned to the latter of the two interceptor missile launch sites. Following the conclusion of a high-profile case where she reported sexual misconduct by one of her superiors, she experienced hazing, bullying and threats from her peers in the military as revenge, hence her new deployment to this remote station.Under the command of Lt. Colonel Marshall, and working alongside Cpl. Beaver Baker and Cpl. Rahul Shah in the station's command center, Collins finds herself as part of the last line of defense after the hostile takeover of Fort Greely. The station is infiltrated by a small group of operatives led by ex-military intelligence soldier Kessel, who promptly kill Marshall and the other occupants of the base, leaving only Collins, Shah, and an unconscious Beaver (who was grazed by a stray bullet) holed up in the command center. The infiltrators attempt to negotiate entry into the command center, by which they can disarm the interceptor system and leave the continental U.S. open to nuclear attack from the sixteen stolen warheads. However, they are rebuffed and attempt to forcibly enter instead with blowtorches. An operative launches a surprise attack after entering via a floor hatch, but is defeated and killed by Collins and Shah. Beaver regains consciousness and reveals himself to be an inside man for the infiltrators and motivated by a big pay day and xenophobia, holding both Collins and Shah at gunpoint while allowing Kessel and the remaining operatives to enter and assume control.Kessel hijacks a live feed and streams his manifesto about the failures in the history of the United States online, naming the sixteen American cities to be destroyed, and instructing the terrorist faction to launch the nukes immediately. Collins breaks free of her restraints and locks Kessel, Beaver, and a henchman back out of the command center, while defeating and killing Kira, the lone enemy operative still in the room, and another henchman. Kessel attempts to force Collins to surrender, torturing her father, but she refuses and her father is apparently killed when the transmission is cut. Kessel turns to plan B, initiating the station's scuttling protocol, hoping to sink the station if he cannot take control of it. As the station begins to sink, Shah volunteers to drop through the floor hatch to the ocean below and manually re-engage the station's hatches, in order to slow down the station from sinking, such that the interceptors are still able to launch and destroy the warheads when they eventually pass through the airspace overhead. Shah succeeds, but he is killed by Beaver.Collins decides to make a risky gamble, hiding in the command center and letting Kessel, Beaver, and the remaining henchman take over and disable the seemingly empty center. Her ruse works, with Beaver going to check up on the station's roof to find and eliminate her. Collins is able to stealthily dispatch the remaining henchman while Kessel flees the room. Grabbing a laptop, Collins ascends to the roof and plugs the device in, hoping to manually launch the interceptor missiles using this method. She is found by Beaver however, and the two engage in hand to hand combat, with Collins emerging victorious after using razor wire to decapitate Beaver. Kessel, who had called in a Russian submarine to pick up the team of operatives earlier, finds Collins just as she successfully launches the interceptor missiles with a fraction of a second left before the nukes would have crossed the point of interception. His plan failed, he engages in combat with Collins, who manages to defeat and subdue him, just as the Russian submarine ascends from the sea. A pair of Russians emerge from the submarine tower, but rather than shooting Collins, they fire at Kessel instead, and the Russian Captain salutes Collins before departing.Collins later recovers from her ordeal in the hospital, and she is personally given a promotion by the U.S. president for her efforts. She also receives a visit of her father who had been rescued by friends who had witnessed his plight on the live broadcast, and he comforts her over her grief for Shah's death. (thanks to Wikipedia)"

No Limit,2022,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14995258/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Roxana Aubrey decides to drop her studies and escape her life in Paris for a free diving course in the south of France. She is quickly pulled into a life that reaches new depths brought by the weight of an ocean's descent. When Roxana meets world champion freediver, Pascal Gauthier, she falls head over heels in love. She becomes both lover and student as Pascal initiates her into an extreme sport that's as enthralling as it is death defying. Moving from one competition to the next, in dive locations across the world, Roxana begins to push limit after limit, wholly consumed in the throws of this passionate affair... but where will it end? As a little girl, Roxana (Camille Rowe) used to go to the beach with her grandfather, who taught her to dive. The peace and tranquility that she experienced underwater were incomparable to worldly pleasures. She studied to be a marine biologist at college. One day, she noticed a poster of the world-famous free-diver, Pascal Gautier (Sofiane Zermani), who would be giving diving lessons to those interested. Without giving it a second thought, Roxana paid the course fee and reached the location on time.
She met Tom (César Domboy) there, a diving instructor who worked with Pascal. The two shared unmissable chemistry on the first day of class, but the moment Roxana had set her eyes on Pascal, she knew whom she wanted. There are 3 golden rules: 1. Always dive with a partner. 2. Dont try to dive as deep as possible 3. stay calmed and relaxed.
Pascal had an incredible pain tolerance capacity, which was why he could endure the pressure and dive deep into the water. His calmness and capability impressed Roxana, and she could not take her eyes off him during the dinner party after the practice session. Pascal was a womanizer. Even with his girlfriend by his side, he continued to flirt with Roxana. They passionately made out in the washroom, and upon returning, his girlfriend broke up with him.Pascal taught Roxana the techniques to stay under water. Their shared passion for diving brought them closer to each other. Roxana felt at peace in Pascal's presence, and she would not trade it for the world. She soon joined Pascal's team in a practice session. On the first day itself, she understood how risky the profession was. While Pascal was aiming to set a world record by diving 172 meters underwater, his team was spread across several levels (at every 40 ms, with oxygen tanks) to monitor him. The dive is set up with a sled that takes Pascal very deep and whenever he is ready to come back up, he activates an gas cylinder which provides the thrust to quickly shoot him back up to the surface. Only submarines have gone below 172 meters ever. at that depth, the lungs are the size of an orange and a person cannot be given oxygen as their lungs would explode.
Even though Pascal managed to complete the dive safely, one of his team members lost his life. Stephane (Laurent Fernandez), a team member, blamed Pascal for sending the rookie 40 meters down.The team needed a new member, and Roxana stepped in to fill the position. Stephane was against it, knowing how risky it could be for her, but Pascal trusted Roxana's capability. He believed she was a natural and could adapt easily. Roxana learned the safety protocol and was prepared to assist Pascal. On the day of the event, Pascal successfully dived 172 m, and the team celebrated the new world record. Roxana was on top of the world.
She had never felt so alive. She informed her mother that she would leave her studies to accompany Pascal on his journey. Her mother was not supportive of her decision, but she refused to listen to her advice. A few days after setting a new world record, another free-diver managed to go 174m down. Pascal had to compete now, and he was aiming for 176m. But this time, luck was not on his side. He suffered from a blackout, and the doctor advised him to stop diving. Pascal was not ready to give up, and Roxana could not change his mind, knowing how passionate he was about his profession. As he took a break, he introduced Roxana to the world of free-diving. She soon set a new record for French women by going 56m deep in the CWF (constant weight with fins) category. She was celebrated by the media for her achievement, and Pascal watched her from a distance.Pascal could not accept defeat when a US woman Naomi (Natalie Mitson) created another new world record (beating the men's record of 174 m by diving till 178 m). He was determined to dive 180m and create a new record, but his team and the organizers knew that he was not fit enough to do so. As Roxana rose to fame (she consistently continued to shatter more world records and was celebrated as a sex symbol), Pascal could feel his importance fading away. Roxana looked up to him; he was her lover and her mentor, but he could not stand the celebration anymore. He was proud of Roxana but disappointed in himself. He went as far as to state that he would be happy to watch her set the new world record rather than allow any other person to do so. It was important for him to be involved either as a participant or as a coach.Roxana could sense the growing distance between her and Pascal. He would often leave her at night, and she would be left alone. Roxana's childhood was not easy. Her father committed suicide as a result of depression when she was 12. She always wondered why her father left her, and gradually she became obsessed with the idea of death. She attempted suicide, hoping to join her father, but her grandfather saved her life.
We get a sense of how Roxana had been searching for the meaning of her existence, and it was only after meeting Pascal that she realized who she was meant to be. She emphasized how important Pascal was in her life and how the trophies and titles did not hold any value without him in her life. But he did not feel the same way. He was not ready to give up. For him, the competition mattered more than what he shared with Roxana.
He decided Roxana would compete in the no-limit category even though his entire team thought it was a bad idea, but Roxana took up the challenge. She ends the argument by saying that she is doing the dive for herself.
As she trained to prove Pascal right, he cheated on her.Pascal attempts the dive at 180 m and blacks out again. Roxana wants to quit, but Pascal wont let her. Roxana soon found out about his affair (when she follows Pascal one night and sees him kissing another girl), and she sought comfort in Tom. She tells TOm that her next dive (the record attempt) will be her last. She and Tom have sex.
Roxana wants to leave Pascal, but he smashes his hand into a mirror and guilt her into staying. Roxana continues to train with Pascal. Pascal finds out that ROxana cheated on him with Tom.On the day of the competition, Roxana is thrown off by the appearance of the girl with whom Pascal cheated on her. Tom finds Pascal tinkering with the ballast tank, after he and Stephane did the final check on all the equipment. The dive starts and at the bottom, the ballast tank fails to open. Roxana is stuck. She runs out of air and her body gradually floats back up, where Stephane fishes her out of the water.
Tom knows Pascal killed Roxana, but doesn't say anything to the police. The death is deemed accidental."

However, when the objects around him begin to interact with the game, he realizes it is something more, and his family is harmed as a result.Three months later, college student Kayla is working as a cleaner to pay for her studies. She provides new and old technology to her computer-geek friend, Isaac, who in return helps her learn to code so that she can gain sufficient skills for her classes. Kayla's mother, Thea, has become a drug addict after the death of her son Ricky, and also suffers psychological and sexual abuse from her rent collector, Lance, who supplies her with drugs and forces her into prostitution in exchange for not being evicted from her apartment.One day while visiting Isaac after work, Kayla discovers the CURS>R game in his apartment, along with a phone number offering a $125,000 prize.

Isaac and Kayla hack the prize number to a storage facility where the game was created. In recording sessions of the making of CURS>R, they discover that the creator of the game, Beck, found a curse in different symbols and embedded the codes into the game to gain more benefits by using the suffering of gamers. When they discover the code needed, the game traps Isaac and forces Kayla to choose in order to save him, but ends up killing him.The game orders Kayla to ""beat the boss"" and gives her a set of coordinates to follow that lead her to Hal's house, now a cruel man who tortures his wife Laura and son Gabe. Hal explains that he never ended the game and after two levels, it promised to leave them alone if he made more copies of it. The game then orders both Kayla and Hal to fight while reversing the pain that each experiences; i.e., if Hal is hurt, Kayla feels it and if Kayla is hurt, Hal feels it. An intense fight ensues, during which Hal is drowned and Kayla barely manages to survive. Kayla receives the game prize, which enables her to take total control of the curse. She uses this ability to kill Lance, which heals both herself and her mother. It is then revealed that the building in which Kayla worked is owned by Beck, who asks her who is next to suffer.

Charlie is set to go to Jack's house for his birthday, but he has also felt a distance from his father due to his constant excuses for missing out on his life. However, Charlie is also a big fan of The Guard. Meanwhile, CEO Ansel Argon (Michael Pena) of Argon Tactical has been wanting to use the source of The Guard's power for his own sinister schemes.Lily drives Charlie to Jack's house, where he gives him a baseball mitt as a birthday gift...except it's for the wrong hand, as Charlie is a lefty. Jack makes a save with a Nintendo Switch, and the two spend the night playing together until Jack is called away for work. Charlie calls Jack out on his excuses and accepts that his dad will always disappoint him. Charlie pretends to call Lily to pick him up, but he is actually calling Berger so they can hang out.Berger brings Lizzie and Maya over, to Charlie's surprise (and horror). While talking to Maya, Charlie accidentally opens a secret passageway that leads to Jack's basement. The kids head downstairs and discover what appears to be a lab filled with gadgets and a mission log of all of The Guard's heroic activities, leading Charlie to realize that his father is The Guard. The kids begin playing around with the gadgets. At the same time, it's shown that Irons has been working for Argon, trying and failing to locate The Guard's power source. Argon gives Irons until the end of the week to shut the project down and take his team with him.The kids bring some gadgets to school to use to cheat on a test, and Charlie uses a wristband during his next baseball game to beat Forrest this time. However, their usage of gadgets, as well as Jack's G-Mobile, causes Irons and his team to pick up a signal and track the power source. The cops soon chase after the kids, but they manage to shake them off using more gadgets before they make it back to Jack's house. Jack leaves Charlie a message that he will be gone a little longer than expected.The kids continue to hang out in Jack's lair. Here, Maya recalls the incident between herself and Charlie - when they were five and at a birthday party, they nearly kissed until Charlie chickened out and told the kids that Maya had bad breath, leading to her getting the nickname ""Moldy Mouth Maya"". Charlie thinks this is why she left school, but she clarifies that her mom had gotten a job transfer. Soon, Irons and his team show up at the house. They manage to make it into the secret headquarters and contact Argon to head over before Irons locks the place down. Charlie manages to grab the power source before the villains find it. While Charlie, Berger, and Maya hide, the bad guys find Lizzie, as well as Big Mac (who turns out to be Lizzie's boyfriend) since he was there to pick her up. The two are held hostage and order Charlie to give up the power source. Charlie puts his hand on the source and sees visions of war and destruction if he gives it to Argon.Argon rigs the place with bombs before the rest of the kids come up with a plan. Berger uses a magnetic wand to hit Argon with a chair and throw him against the wall. They tie him up, and he explains how the power source works to them, as it is an alien artifact that adapts to the environment it inhabits. He wants to use the source to supposedly create weapons to solve the worlds problems, claiming that The Guard is selfish for keeping the power to himself. Charlie gives Argon the power source, but it turns out to be a fake that the kids made with a 3D printer. They cause a diversion by shutting off the power. Meanwhile, Jack sees security camera footage showing that Charlie and his friends are in danger, so he makes his way back home.The kids fight the villains for the power source until Irons gets his hands on it, which also allows him to see similar visions to what Charlie saw, and he realizes Argon cannot be trusted, since he is fully prepared to kill the kids and leave no witnesses. Berger uses the wand to grab the power source and throw it into a portal connected to his locker at school. Jack shows up, and he begins to defend the kids. Argon gets hold of one of Jack's gadgets and forms his own suit, while Jack cannot suit up because he is not fully powered. Argon kidnaps Berger and forces him to show him where the source is at the school. Charlie leads everyone, including Irons, to work together to stop Argon.The gang tries to 3D print jetpacks to head to the school. Lizzie tries to crack the system code while Charlie and Maya get trapped and nearly crushed by falling debris, at which point Charlie admits his feelings to Maya. Lizzie saves them, and they use jetpacks to fly together to head to the school, just as Argon's bombs go off and destroy the lair.As a dance goes on at school, Argon brings Berger to his locker, but one of his teachers took it out of the locker and realizes Argon is a bad guy, so she helps Berger run. Argon forces the other kids in the gym to clear out as he tries to get Berger and the source. Charlie, Jack, and the others arrive for the showdown. Jack suits up and fights Argon, leading to the final confrontation in the gym. Just as Argon tries to grab the power source, Charlie throws a grenade at it, which blows up and sends Argon through a portal. After everyone turns out to be okay, Charlie dances with Maya, and they have their first kiss.Charlie and Jack are later shown finally spending more time together. Charlie gets a distress signal, and Jack shows a new G-Mobile that Charlie can drive when he is older. They then head out on a heroic mission.The ending text/clips show that Irons now works as the head of Mission Control for The Guard, and he continues his podcast on alien things. Lizzie and Big Mac are still dating, and are planning for their own first kiss. Berger uses the portal device to become a DJ. Maya is supposedly interning for the CIA (but it is not confirmed). The Kincaids are now a crime-fighting family. Also, Argon is alive but trapped in another dimension, still stuck in his power suit. (thanks to themoviespoiler)"

Kath leaves in disgust.Cut to the time when Max meets Greta and Al in the liquor store. Greta flirts with Max and invites him to a house party. There she flirts with him more and invites him to that cabin.Max returns two hours later. They argue, and Max blames Kath for being too old-fashioned and not spontaneous enough. He invites her to the cabin.Cut to Max and Kath driving to the cabin, but this time from Al and Greta's POV. They are expecting Max to be alone, and Al freaks out when he finds out he's not. In the morning, after Kath leaves, Al runs back to the cabin. Greta shows a drugged Max sleeping inside a plastic chemical barrel. She leans in to lick his face and takes a selfie. Before that, it is shown that Greta finds a letter in the cabin (important later).Kath and Nicholas are hitting it off. Nicholas says his cure is a transfusion treatment. Later, Kath drives to the cabin to give him a tiny avocado plant as a present. (He lives there and ""rented"" out the cabin.) He leaves to get wood to heat up water for tea and leaves a bundle of keys on the table. Kath riffs through his books and finds a photo of a younger Nicholas holding a baby. She turns the photo over, and it's a photo of Nicholas and Al! Al is his son.
.
Horrified, Kath grabs the keys and explores the cabin. She sees a shipping container in the woods. She walks to the container and unlocks it. Inside the containers are medical equipment and monitors, and Max is in a hospital bed hooked to a transfusion machine.In the woods, Nicholas meets Al and Greta, who are hiding out. (They were in the cabin when Kath arrived.) Deciding to confront Kath, they find her in the shipping container. Al and Greta are scientists (They were wearing the green lab coat to prepare to harvest Max that night.) Greta is the one who wants to use Max for harvesting, but she lets out a big secret: Nicholas is negative for having the degenerative neuron disease (the letter says negative test result), so Nicholas's motive for getting transfusion is to not age. Nicholas explains: he doesn't want to grow old and weak like his father and wants to spend more time with Al. He helps Kath out to keep tabs on her investigation but grew close to her. Hearing this, Kath plays to Nicholas's sympathy and says that she wants the transfusion too. She says she's dating Max to stay young, and every day of getting old scares her. That means Greta is to be harvested. Al and Nick subdue Greta with a sedative. But this is all a ruse as Kath tries to walk out with Max. A disoriented Max rips a tube out from his neck and promptly bleeds out. Kath runs out of the container and locks Al, Greta, and Nicholas inside. She sits in her car to collect herself and walks into the cabin, opens a window, and stares out. (thanks to themoviespoiler)"

Fire Island,2022,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt15218000/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A group of queer best friends gather in Fire Island Pines for their annual week of love and laughter, but a sudden change of events might make this their last summer in gay paradise. Set in the iconic Pines, Andrew Ahn's FIRE ISLAND is an unapologetic, modern day rom-com showcasing a diverse, multicultural examination of queerness and romance. Inspired by the timeless pursuits from Jane Austen's classic Pride and Prejudice, the story centers around two best friends (Joel Kim Booster and Bowen Yang) who set out to have a legendary summer adventure with the help of cheap rosé and their cadre of eclectic friends. The film opens with Noah (Joel Kim Booster), a young gay man, waking up after a one-night stand with some guy he met the night before. He finds a bunch of unanswered texts and calls from his gay best friend group, as they are set to take off for their annual holiday summer weekend to Fire Island located off Long Island, New York. Noah makes it to a boat where he joins his ""sisters"" - Keegan (Tomas Matos), Luke (Matt Rogers), Max (Torian Miller), and Howie (Bowen Yang), who has the closest bond with Noah.The guys arrive at the island where they meet with their mother figure, Erin (Margaret Cho), whose house they stay at all the time. After unpacking, Noah and Howie drink beers and share a joint as they talk about where they are now in life, and how Howie hasn't been around since getting a better job in New York City. The guys make it their goal to get laid while they are there which they dub Fire Island as the 'Gay Disneyland'. Not long after, Max accidentally shoves Noah and causes him to drop his phone in the swimming pool. After putting it in rice, Erin admits to the guys that she is broke and that this will be the last year that they can spend the summer at that house, but they all are determined to make the most out of this holiday.The group goes out to dancing with other island visitors. Howie is checked out by a doctor named Charlie (James Scully), while Noah's attention is caught by a lawyer named Will (Conrad Ricamora). Before Noah can talk to Will, another guy tries hitting on Noah, prompting Will to walk away. Charlie and his friends start to leave, so Howie's friends push him (literally) to stage a meet-cute. It works, and Charlie chats up Howie as they and their friends watch the sunset. While Charlie and Howie get along, Noah puts his foot in his mouth when he makes a comment about lawyers and finds out Will is one. Charlie then invites the guys to a party at the house he and his friends are staying at later that night.The group shows up for the party, where they are surprised at how big the house is. They also stand out as seeming like the ""trashiest"" bunch compared to the wealthier crowd at the party. Charlie's snooty friend Braden (Aidan Wharton) ""greets"" them, but Charlie comes to be more hospitable to the guys. Howie talks to Charlie, but Charlie later notes to Will that Howie hasn't asked Charlie what his interests are. Noah overhears the conversation since he was using their bathroom, and he hears Will refer to him as ""annoying"". The guys have to leave after Keegan and Luke get too drunk and rowdy, and Luke vomits into an urn in front of everyone.The next morning, Noah notices Howie stayed at Charlie and Will's house, thinking he might have hooked up with Charlie. He goes over to the house and just finds Howie passed out in the bathtub because he was very drunk. Noah and Howie then invite Charlie and his friends to their house later that night for dinner. Despite Erin not being thrilled about having to cook and entertain guests, she sends the guys out for groceries. There, they meet a guy named Dex (Zane Phillips), who hits it off with Noah and his friends. When they find out that Will knows Dex, Noah invites Dex to the house as well.During the dinner party, Noah and Will continue to act confrontational and belligerent toward each other. Noah and Dex talk about how Will thinks he's better than most people because he comes from money, and he also looks down on Dex for making an OnlyFans page. Noah and Dex start to kiss before they are interrupted. When everyone is gathered for dinner, Charlie tells the guys that they are unlike anyone he has met before.Howie spends more time with Charlie and they eventually kiss. The guys do drugs (snorting cocaine and drinking scotch) and later go to an underwear party, where Noah is told by Charlie's friend Cooper (Nick Adams) that Charlie brought Will along so that they could hook up, seemingly to get in Noah's head due to an obvious attraction between him and Will. Noah finds Dex, and they go to hook up, but just as Noah starts to go down on Dex, he sees Will in the corner looking uncomfortable. Noah jumps up too fast and accidentally slams his head into Dex's nose, causing it to bleed. As Dex goes to the bathroom, Will pulls Noah aside and tells him that Dex is not who he pretends to be. The guys also spot Charlie kissing his ex, Chad (Jonathon Timpanelli), whom Cooper says was flown in for Charlie. This leaves Howie feeling depressed.Noah's friends end up leaving on a water taxi to go to another party, leaving him to walk home alone with Will as it starts raining. They continue arguing over Noah's perception of Will as being a snob, leading to Noah falling into the mud. Will helps him up and nearly kisses Noah, but he pulls back from Will because he thinks they don't like each other. Will explains that part of his behavior comes from the fact that he thinks people take advantage of Charlie's kindness and Will doesn't want to see him get hurt. Noah manages to find Howie, but they just end up getting into an argument because Howie isn't enjoying the trip the way that Noah thought he would. Noah goes back to the house and feels like he messed up.Noah is woken up the next day by Erin, Keegan, and Max, as they deliver him a letter written and left by Will. He explains himself further and apologizes for the impression he gave off, and says that Dex hurt someone close to Will, which is why he doesn't trust him and was warning Noah about him. After he reads the letter, he sees Charlie has come over to talk to Howie. Charlie leaves, and Howie throws himself into the pool. He explains to the group that Charlie was told that Chad has Lyme disease and he wants to be there for Chad, so he will be leaving the island sooner than expected.Noah goes to a drag bar where he runs into Will. He shows Noah Dex's Instagram profile, showing that he posts a lot of sexy pics with activism tags (""Black Lives Matter"" and ""Stop Asian Hate"") to get attention. Noah and Will talk more, and Will ends up getting on the stage to dance. The two continue to hang out into the morning.Later on, the group goes to another spot where Howie does karaoke. Things take a downward turn when Erin receives a video of Luke having sex with Dex being posted online. Noah prepares to confront Dex but gets help from Will, who uses his lawyer skills to convince Dex that he will serve jail time if he doesn't remove the video since it was posted without Luke's consent. Dex agrees. Noah is impressed and walks along the beach with Will. The spark between them becomes clearer.The next day, Howie tells Noah he is leaving because, despite his denial, he cannot get over seeing Charlie with Chad. Noah runs to Charlie's house to tell him what the deal is, as Charlie acknowledges that he and Howie like each other the same way. With the help of Noah's friends, the group hijacks a water taxi to catch up to Howie since his boat already left. Charlie manages to catch up to him and express his feelings to Howie, leading them to kiss again.In the final scene, the group goes to watch the sunset again. Noah and Will dance together and finally kiss. The friends run over to cheer them on."

A Disney+ Original movie, ""Cheaper by the Dozen"" is a reimagining of the 2003 hit family comedy. It is the story of the raucous exploits of a blended family of 12, the Bakers, as they navigate a hectic home life while simultaneously managing their family business.—Walt Disney Studios Without a doubt, raising twelve children while juggling a career and a hectic home life can be a challenging task. Indeed, Paul and Zoey Baker, who already struggle to bring order to their lovely blended family, have their plate full. And, as if that weren't enough, a tempting, lucrative business proposition comes out of the blue, ushering in a new lifestyle, extra responsibilities, and unforeseen complications. Can the Bakers survive the side effects of success?—Nick Riganas The Bakers are a blended family that began with Paul Baker (Zach Braff) and his wife Kate (Erika Christensen) (who dreams about expanding her yoga studio) who together had daughters Ella (Kylie Rogers) (Wants to be a social media Influencer) and Harley (Caylee Blosenski) (wants her punk band to go viral) and their adopted son Haresh (Aryan Simhadri) (who wants to be a music player) after their friends died in a car accident. Kate and Paul got married after she got pregnant in college. As time went on, Kate felt suffocated in the relationship with Paul. Kate eventually divorced Paul, but they remained friends with Kate acting as an occasional, though slightly inattentive, babysitter.Zoey (Gabrielle Union) married football player Dominic ""Dom"" Clayton (Timon Durrett) and had daughter Deja (Journee Brown) (wants to play basketball) and son DJ (Andre Robinson) (who wants to be a Lego designer and a comic book artist). Due to Dom's celebrity life, Zoey divorced him and took custody of the kids.
Paul met Zoey after she visited his small restaurant and suggested that he make the entire menu breakfast themed all day. The two eventually got married, expanded the restaurant, renamed it Baker's Breakfast and had two sets of twins: Luca (Leo Abelo Perry) and Luna (Mykal-Michelle Harris), and Bronx (Sebastian Cote) and Bailey (Christian Cote).Dom continues to be active in Deja and DJ's lives which slightly intimidates Paul as he was rarely there to begin with. While Deja prepares for her basketball scholarship, DJ feels that he connects with Paul more than Dom and would rather speak with him. Deja has a successful game in front of a scout and when Paul offers to celebrate, she decides to go for a 1:1 lunch with Dom instead.
Paul gets a meeting with a large company to expand his restaurant. He succeeds and has his famous sauce (that tastes Sweet, Salty and Savory depending on what you put it on) sold on shelves. The investors Melanie and Michelle buy out the company name and brand in exchange for the funding. He decides to use the money to move the family and their pet dogs Bark Obama and Joe Bitin' from Los Angeles to Calabasas, in a bigger house in a gated community. Deja is not happy as she would have to move to a new team.
As the sauce gets popular, the investors propose an expansion plan, which means more work for Paul.Upon arrival, Zoey begins to feel the effects of racial profiling, especially after meeting her neighbor Anne (June Diane Raphael). Paul suddenly gets a call informing him that his sister Rachel (Cynthia Murell) has checked into rehab, forcing him to take in his nephew Seth (Luke Prael), who has had a habit of being a thief. The kids are not happy about this decision, but they are not given a choice. Seth bonds with Haresh when he discovers that he is being picked on at the new school because of his ethnicity and teaches him to defend himself. Deja begins seeing a boy named Chris (Simeon Daise) and sneaks out of the house to see him.Paul finds himself having to travel to look for new places to expand his restaurant. The investors Melanie (Brittany Daniel) and Michele (Cynthia Daniel Hauser) also insist on altering some of his business ideals to cut costs. They also insist that Paul changes the brand name, as it is confusing with chains with a similar sounding name. He starts to miss out on being with his family which upsets Zoey as this was the reason she divorced Dom. Deja doesn't get game time, as the new coach keeps benching her in favor of other white kids on the team.
On DJ's birthday, Paul rushes to get home. During the party, things start to get out of hand as DJ changes his look to impress a girl, Haresh and Seth are suspended from school for a week after starting a fight with the kids who bullied Haresh, and Anne profiles Zoey's family for a series of recent break-ins. Upon Paul arriving, Deja reveals that she quit the basketball team and that the entire family has been unhappy since arriving in Calabasas. Feeling that Zoey can no longer handle their kids, Dom announces that he wants full custody of Deja and DJ.Harley and Ella accuse Seth of the break-ins after Haresh pointed out that he saw him stealing from the restaurant cash register, though he returned it and he angrily leaves. Upon realizing their mistake, the Bakers, Kate, and Dom all go out and find Seth. They apologize and admit that he is part of the family and he rejoins them.Back at home, Paul and Dom discuss their different upbringings; while Paul will never know what it is like to be at a disadvantage, Dom has to understand that being away from his kids has made him distant and that he needs to be more attentive. Realizing how much his family means to him, Paul breaks his deal with the company so that he can run the restaurant himself. The Bakers move back to Los Angeles and buy a new house. While having dinner, or rather breakfast, at the newly named Baker's Dozen Breakfast, Paul reveals the design of the sauce bottle has changed to reflect the family, Seth included.The end credits show Dom, Paul, and Zoey were able to invest their sauce and went National. Kate invented bird yoga. Seth moved back in with his mom after she got out of rehab, but still spends lots of time with his cousins. Deja and Chris soon started their freshman years at USC. Ella became the social manager for Harley's punk band and a video of her band playing at her school talent show broke the internet.

Mike Fallon, aka The Accident Man, is back and this time he must best the top assassins in the world, to protect the ungrateful son of a mafia boss, save the life of his only friend and rekindle his relationship with his maniacal father figure.—Anon. Still dealing with his guilt after being forced to kill his assassin co-workers, assassin Mike Fallon (Scott Adkins) moves to the island of Malta to decompress and get away from London, finding work as a hit-man for hire in nearby countries and keeping martial artist Wong Siu-ling (Sarah Chang) (a descendant of Kung-Fu master Wong Fei-Hung who ultimately becomes Mike's sidekick) on his payroll to fight him at random times and keep his skills sharp.One night, Mike runs into old friend Finicky Fred (Perry Benson) (Mike's colleague from the first film who specializes in unorthodox weapon), who informs him that their former boss Big Ray (Ray Stevenson) (Mike's maniacal father figure and mentor from the first film) lost his assassin's bar after Mike's vengeful rampage. Big Ray lost all his clients after word got out that he had lost all his assassins.
Fred is out of money due to giving a large sum to a woman he fell in love with online. Mike says that Fred has been scammed, but Fred is sure that his girl Leylo is real and lives in Malta. Fred is in Malta to meet her.
Mike takes pity on Fred and allows him to stay in his house and assist him on hits. Fred is really useful in the field with his devices and business is booming. Mike is happy for the first time in a long while. He and Fred put together a secret headquarters to test out Fred's gadgets and plan jobs. Fred has designed a set of explosive suits, that look just like a normal suit, that Mike thinks won't work.
On Mike's advice, Fred rejects a contract put out on Dante Zuuzer (George Fouracres), the spoiled heir to a Cosa Nostra organization that even Mike fears.
Siu-Ling promises to help Fred find Leylo.After carrying out another hit, Mike and Fred are abducted and taken to meet with Mrs. Zuuzer (Flaminia Cinque), who asks Mike to hunt down and kill whoever accepted the contract on Dante in exchange for sparing Fred's life; an attempted hit on Dante had been carried out using Mike's Modus Operandi. Dante snorts cocaine all day and has dreams of becoming a pop singer, even though his voice is terrible. She knows that the contract on Dante was put out by a corporate CEO out of Scandinavia.The Zuuzers release Mike, who encounters Big Ray in his local pub - Fred had sent Ray a letter explaining their new business operation against Mike's advice. Ray vows revenge on Mike, revealing he's in Malta for a job, and Mike deduces he was behind the attempt on Dante's life.
Ray explains that the client has raised the bounty to Euros 9 million and opened the contract to any takers, as well as hacked into the tracking device in Dante's watch to broadcast his location. Mike resolves to protect Dante in order to keep Fred alive.Mike arrives at the karaoke bar where Dante sings, but Dante refuses to destroy his watch and swallows it. Assassin Freya Du Preeze (Zara Phythian) (a highly skilled assassin claimed to have been trained in the dark arts by those who viewed James Bond as a ""muppet"") arrives first and kills Dante's team of bodyguards before Mike fights her and kills her with a barbecue skewer.
It is clear that Dante doesn't like Mike, who keeps pushing him around. Dante orders Mike to take him back to his mother, but Mike talks to Mrs. Zuuzers and agrees to keep Dante alive in exchange for Fred's life.He then forces Dante to take a laxative in order to pass the watch, but the two are accosted by blood-drinking assassin Yendi the Vampire (Faisal Muhammed) (an assassin from Ghana who enjoys consuming blood), who Mike kills with his own machete.
They travel to Mike's headquarters, hoping to keep Dante secure, where Mike meets Siu-ling. Siu-Ling says she knows that Mike is an assassin and wants to join him.
Mike fights Poco the Killer Clown (Beau Fowler) (a highly durable killer clown who carries a giant hammer as his main weapon) and kills him with one of Fred's previously broken gadgets, while Siu-ling fights rival assassin Silas the Strangler (Peter Lee Thomas) (an assassin who prefers to strangle his victims to death) and strangles him to death with a heavy chain.Dante manages to pass the watch before nearly being killed by swordsman Oyumi (Andreas Nguyen) (an assassin with Japanese origins whose fighting style is based on Ninjutsu); Mike challenges him to a hand-to-hand fight for Dante's life, but receives a beating before Big Ray arrives and kills Oyumi with a shotgun.
Ray attempts to kill Dante, but Mike convinces him to stand down for Fred and destroy the tracking device. Mike says that Ray brought him up, and so Ray is responsible for the way he turned out. Mike says that Fred is the only real friend he has in life and tells Ray that even killers need friends.
Ray relents and asks Dante to clean up and change into one of Fred's suits.Mike, Ray, and Siu-ling transport Dante to Mrs. Zuuzer to exchange him for Fred; Mrs. Zuuzer orders Mike and Fred to leave the island, but Ray detonates an explosive that Fred had planted in Dante's suit, killing Dante and Mrs. Zuuzer and earning them the 9-million-euro bounty.Fred meets the woman he fell in love with online, but Mike explains that she left him after learning he was an assassin. In an ending voiceover, Mike tells the audience that the bounty allowed him, Fred, and Ray to set up a new assassins' organization and move on to the next chapter of their lives, which he promises to be ""a f**king Belter""."

The Takedown,2022,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt13822738/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Diakité and Monge are police officers who are complete opposites, and get paired together to uncover an unexpectedly big criminal case. Ousmane Diakité (Omar Sy) and François Monge (Laurent Lafitte) are two cops with very different styles, backgrounds and careers. Many years ago they worked together but life took them apart. The unlikely pair is reunited once again for a new investigation that takes them all the way up to the French Alps. What seemed to be a simple drug deal turns out to be a high scale criminal case wrapped in danger and unexpected comedy.—Netflix The film follows Ousmane Diakhité (Omar Sy), a rebel chief of the Paris crime division, and his old friend, François Monge (Laurent Lafitte), a narcissist and self-absorbed deputy chief of the district judicial police, who cross paths again after the events of the original film, ""On the Other Side of the Tracks,"" that came out in 2012. Together, they go on a two-man mission to solve a murder case in Valergnes.Chief Ousmane Diakhité is a rebel police officer who doesn't abide by the laws and can go to any lengths to finish the mission. His recklessness and overconfidence is depicted in the opening sequence of the film, where Ousmane and his partner, Djimo, walk into an underground boxing arena to arrest Europe's most wanted criminal, Jordan Diaz. Ousmane acts all heroic and tries to arrest bulky Jordan without waiting for the backup team, which in turn leads to a ruckus that is recorded on camera. After Jordan's arrest, Ousmane's superior calls him unmanageable and obsessive, yet doesn't take any action against him because of his recent social media popularity. Instead, the department wants to wash off their sins and make him the poster boy of the police department because of his skin color. However, Ousmane has no interest in promoting anyone's agenda and thus declines the offer without a second thought.In the other part of the story, François Monge, deputy chief of the 12th district Judicial Police, is sitting in front of his therapist for evaluation after his colleagues reported his severe superiority complex and called him a liability for the department. Monge charmingly defends himself and woes his therapist while the scene also establishes the fact that Monge has taken the police chief's exam three times and has failed miserably each time. He even requested a transfer to the criminal division five times, but his application was rejected every time.While receiving his affluent parents at Lyon station, Monge spots a severed half-body and decides to investigate further. Ousmane, from the crime division, arrives at the scene and is surprised to see his old partner. It is suggested that the two fell apart after Ousmane cracked the police chief's exam and Monge failed to clear it, even after having affluent and well-connected parents.Ousmane is informed that the other half of the severed body that belongs to Kevin Marchal has been found by the Saint-Julien-en-Genevois station on a train track outside Valergnes. He decides to travel to Valergnes, and as soon as Monge hears about it, he requests Ousmane to take him with him. After Ousmane refuses, Monge uses his parents' connection and the two cops land in Valergnes to solve the mystery surrounding Kevin's brutal murder.In Valergnes, Monge and Ousmane met Deputy Captain, Alice Gauthier (Izïa Higelin), who took the cops to the morgue where they learned that Kevin Marchal was shot twice and his body was bisected using a sharp metal object that left cauterized wounds near the edges. The cops went straight to the Saint-Julien-en-Genevois station and Ousmane surmised that someone was chasing Kevin and, after they shot him in the leg, he lost balance on his bike and crashed into a bridge and fell onto the high-voltage cables that cut his body into two halves. One part of his body fell into a train passing at the same moment that carried it to Lyon station, where Monge found it. Ousmane believed that someone took away Kevin's bike to erase the tracks, so he decided to investigate Kevin's house to find any clues in there.At Kevin's place, Ousmane found a secret lab where he was producing a methamphetamine called Pervitin that was used by the Nazis during the war. However, Kevin's mother had no idea about her son's secret lab, and thus Ousmane decided to interrogate his friend/girlfriend, Jessica, who worked at a bar called ""Le Cherry."" While Monge tried to investigate Jessica, Ousmane came across a racist hulk in the bar named Carl Muller, who attacked Ousmane without warning. Monge and Ousmane tried to stop Carl, and finally Monge used a taser gun on him, killing Carl on the spot. He had a plethora of drugs in his system that resulted in a sudden cardiac arrest. Ousmane also found a tattoo on Carl's neck that led the cops to a security company called Securitec, which ran a white supremacist society called Sons of Clovis. At the HQ of Securitec, Ousmane met their leader, Goran Jurdik, who told him that Carl was a member and even had a locker inside the facility. Coincidentally, Monge found a Tokarev inside Carl's locker that established the fact that Carl killed Kevin.Chief Mercier hurriedly closed the case as soon as the murder weapon was recovered and asked the Paris cops to go home, but Ousmane found everything too easy, probably a well planned conspiracy to send them back. He decided to stay back and plunge into the mystery further. Jessica had told them about a guy named Nader that Kevin used to hang out with. Ousmane and Monge track down Nader, who tells them that the Sons of Clovis are psychos and Kevin had even called the police chief Mercier about their activities. Ousmane and Monge are intrigued that Mercier never mentioned that Kevin had called him on multiple occasions before he died.
They followed police Chief Mercier and kept a close eye on Antoine Brunner (Dimitri Storoge), the racist mayor of the province and leader of the France Vive Party. Brunner confronts Ousmane and racially insults him. When Ousmane and Monge follow Mercier, a car tries to run them off the road, but they survive by throwing a smoke grenade inside their car, which then falls over the ledge
Inside Brunner's house, Ousmane and Monge found a secret basement from where Brunner had been planning a coordinated attack on various religious spots that belonged to people whom he considered outsiders. His main target was an immigrant center, as Brunner and his fellow white supremacists wanted to inflict fear among the immigrants and drive them out of their country. Kevin found out about Brunner's grand plan that scared him and decided to inform Chief Mercier about it, unaware of the fact that Mercier was working for Brunner too and passionately shared his racist beliefs. Probably, Brunner asked Goran Jurdik to send his best man, Carl, to kill Kevin Marchal so as to erase the evidence of their plan.As soon as Ousmane and Monge found out about Brunner's coordinated attacks, they shared the locations with Alice Gauthier and decided to stop Brunner before it was too late. They arrived at Brunner's secret hideout, where he was motivating his fellow patriots with a hate speech. Ousmane asked Monge to divert their attention while Ousmane threw away their weapons into the river to sabotage their mission. However, suddenly Alice arrived at the scene and attacked Ousmane, thus establishing the fact that she was working with Brunner from the beginning and had been only helping Ousmane and Monge to keep an eye on their actions so that they wouldn't sabotage Brunner's plan. Ousmane handcuffed Alice to a car and tried to save Monge, who was surrounded by Brunner's goons. As soon as Brunner found out that Ousmane had thrown away all their weapons, he decided to travel to the immigrant center to explode it. Alice removed the cuffs from herself and drove Brunner to the immigrant center while Ousmane and Monge followed them.At the location, Ousmane rammed his vehicle into Alice's car to stop them. Brunner crawled out of the crushed car and armed the bomb manually, and Ousmane and Monge had only 3 minutes to save the immigrants. Fortunately, they evacuated the premise in time and avoided any human casualties, and as soon as the bomb exploded, a part of the debris fell near Brunner. During the final face-off, Ousmane and Monge knocked down Brunner, who was later indicted for his ties to a domestic terrorist group.The case helped Ousmane and Monge bridge their differences and finally cherish their friendship. At this point, Ousmane wanted to help Monge get the recognition that he yearned for, as all the credit for Brunner's case was taken away by Ousmane's senior. He called Benoit Meaux, the communications director, who eagerly wanted to make Ousmane the poster boy for the police force. At the end of ""The Takedown,"" Ousmane requested Benoit to cast Monge instead of him, and probably the department complied to his wishes, which is why at the end of ""The Takedown,"" we saw Monge shooting for the promotional video. Well, Monge finally got some limelight and a clip to show off after years of failure and rejection to join the crime division."

The film quickly establishes that Kosta has married Rina, though he uses his wife to physically please his potential investors so that they will hand him the money without going too much into the details. Kosta has arranged a party to get some investors for a new project, and the FBI, hiding inside a van parked outside Kosta's villa, instructs Rina to use the distraction in their favor. The government authorities want some confidential information on Kosta; therefore, Rina walks into Kosta's office and opens his safe in order to transfer the files. However, at this point, she intentionally drops her hidden camera given to her by the FBI and quickly takes out an electronic wallet and some codes from two different shelves. She quickly closes the safe and tries to sneak away when Kosta confronts her and tries to assault her. Rina kicks Kosta out of the window, which leads to his sudden death. Kosta's associate, Marco Sari, who is in love with Rina, tries to stop her, but she runs away and sits in the FBI van, suggesting to Marco that she has been working for the FBI for a long time.Earlier, the Marshalls had promised Rina that they would give her a new identity and a new passport to leave the country in exchange for gathering evidence against Kosta and his Syndicate. But after Kosta's death, they changed their conditions and now want Rina to testify at trial, which means she cannot have her passport and her freedom until she fulfills their demands. The head of the department, Keisha Rhodes, suggests Rina take federal protection until the trial and assigns deputy Mason Pollard to her for the same. However, Rina refuses to become a prisoner of the state and walks out of the office.In the meantime, Marco, who replaces Kosta, swears to take revenge on Rina for tricking them both and killing one of his own. The Syndicate has also instructed Marco to recover ""the cold wallet"" that Rina had stolen from Kosta's safe, as the wallet holds some very crucial information. Later that night, Marco assembles a team of masked assassins and raids Rina's attorney's house, where Rina is hiding. Fortunately, Mason, who had been keeping an eye on the apartment, quickly arrived at the scene and helped Rina fake her death in order to escape Marco and his men. After rescuing Rina, Mason once again gives her an offer to become a state witness and take federal protection. Rina steps out of Mason's car to think for a moment, when she discreetly disposes of the seedcodes required to access the cold wallet. She then sits in the car and agrees to testify.Mason takes Rina to Cape Town, South Africa, where he arranges a new life for her. She starts living in a new country under a new identity named Rachel Madison. However, Mason soon finds out that Rina is hiding something from him, yet he ignores the fact and doesn't confront it because he doesn't want Rina to feel like a prisoner. Soon, Mason learns from Keisha Rhodes about a breach in the system because of which the covers of all their witnesses have been compromised, and thus they need to create a new cover for each one of them as soon as possible. Paul Whitlock, Mason's senior, arrives in Cape Town to protect one of his clients, but soon, Mason discovers that Whitlock has been working for Marco and the Syndicate, and thus the entire breach thing was a setup to find out Rina's location. The film from here on follows Mason's pursuit to protect Rina from his own people until the trial.The cold wallet that Rina had stolen from Kosta's safe was a polycarbonate crypto drive used to store some cryptocurrencies that Kosta used for bribes. It could only be opened by the seedcodes that consisted of 24 words that Kosta had engraved on a golden sheet. It was the same sheet that Rina had gotten rid of because she had mugged up all the 24 words. It also made her the only person who knew the seedcodes, therefore acting as an insurance policy for her safety. However, the cold wallet had a tracking code attached to it, and as soon as Rina tried to transfer the money into her account, Whitlock hacked Rina's DAX fiat account and transferred all the money to Ocean Trace International, which was a shipping company that used to sell endangered animals on the black market. Whitlock had been on the task force that was investigating Ocean Trace and probably cracked a deal with them as well to get the money. The seedcodes and the cold wallet were the only things that were protecting Rina so far, and hence, as soon as Marco and Whitlock got the money, they opened fire on Mason and Rina. Marco finally kidnaps Rina from the bank and takes her to the dockyard, from where he had planned to sell Rina on the black market along with a rhinoceros that they had captured.The climax fight takes place between Mason and his mentor, Paul Whitlock, at the dockyard, where Mason is able to get rid of Whitlock forever. He arrived at the docks and, with the help of the two misfits, was able to take down an entire gang of thugs. During the fight, Marco was shot dead by Rina while the rhino took care of Whitlock. It attacked him from behind, pierced his guts with its sharp horn, and took him for a ride. Soon after, Keisha Rhodes arrived at the docks with the team, but it was obvious there was no one important left alive to arrest.Some six months later, Rina appeared at the trial and testified against the Syndicate. After the hearing, Mason gave her a crypto drive that contained 644,000 dollars, probably a part of her cut from the money the authorities had recovered from the account of Ocean Trace International. And as promised, Mason also handed her a new passport with the name Robyn Nhi Nguyen written on it, which was probably her birth name. Mason tells Rina that her new resume will inform the world that she is a financial planner, which was something that Rina always wanted to be, and probably with a huge amount of money in her account, she would be able to plan her finances well. Before finally taking a leave, Rina asks Mason about the ""bud"" tattoo on his body, which, according to Mason, was a homage to all the people he wasn't able to protect and, thus, they had to die a real death. His brother was one such person. As soon as Mason walks Rina to a vehicle, the vehicle blows up. No, Rina doesn't die at this moment. Instead, it was another cover-up so that the Syndicate would not hunt for her, and she could live a peaceful life away from their threats.At the end of ""Eraser: Reborn,"" we see Rina, walking inside a sewer line with Sugar Jax, who has now become Mason's permanent sidekick. The car that blew up was probably parked above a manhole through which Rina and Sugar escaped and blew up the car later to orchestrate their fake deaths. While walking in the sewer line, Rina and Sugar spot a person coming toward them, and soon it is revealed that it is none other than deputy Mason Pollard, who has fallen in love with a witness and is ready to cross the line to be with her.

Blackout,2022,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8363392/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A man wakes in a hospital with no memory, and quickly finds himself on the run in a locked down hospital with the Cartel on his tail. He scrambles to find his true identity in the most vicious way. Ethan McCoy (Nick Nolte) of the DEA is carrying out a search inside a burned-down house and is looking for Cain (Josh Duhamel). Unable to find any evidence, he orders his DEA men to track Cain wherever he is. Cain was shown escaping the house a few minutes before it blew up. He was pursued by armed assailants and his car was blown up.
Meanwhile, John Cain wakes up in a Mexican hospital without having any idea of who he is or how he got there. A woman by his side, Anna (Abbie Cornish), claims to be his wife. There is also a guy named Eddie (Omar Chaparro) who is supposed to be his friend. Eddie promises to help him bring his memory back. He then makes his way to the doctor, under whose care Cain is, and threatens to kill his family unless he brings back Cain's memory by any means necessary.Anna says that Cain was born on Dec 2nd, 1972, in Boulder Colorado.
With time, as Cain's memory comes back to him in bits and pieces, he finds that those around him aren't what they seem. Cain knows that Anna is not his wife. Cain realizes that every time he remembers something, the Doctor gives him a sedative. Cain attacks the doctor and tries to escape the hospital with Anna.
Eddie and his men attack Cain and force him to hide inside the hospital. Anna tells Cain that he is very close to Eddie and Eddie is a drug dealer. Eddie and Cain did all kinds of deals together. Cain believes that he is a drug dealer.
Cain doesn't believe Anna and ties her to a chair in the utilities area. Cain starts attacking Cain's men inside the hospital.The doctor finds Cain and takes him to a cabin. Cain finds out that they are looking for a case he had in his possession before he landed in the hospital. He stole it from General Mondejo, head of the army, someone to whom all the cartels report, and then went off-grid. And since he arrived at the hospital, Eddie has been trying to administer memory drugs to bring his memory back so that he can remember the location of the case. The Doctor was giving him B12 to counter the effects of the memory drugs. The doctor is helping Cain, as he has been terrorized by Eddie for many years.
Cain calls a number that he found inside his wallet. He is connected to McCoy. McCoy tells him that he is DEA and has been undercover in Eddie's organization for the last 5 years. Cain finds evidence of Eddie's drugs operation inside the hospital.
Cain returns to Anna. Anna tells him that he was recruited by the CIA. John Cain knows he is in a ""Blackout.""One of Eddie's men finds Cain. Cain learns that Montejo paid money $20 million for the case, but Cain double crossed him by taking the money and the case. Cain talks to Eddie.
Eddie tells Cain that he knew Cain was DEA (McCoy told Cain earlier that he was DEA), and they both decided to ""play"" DEA by stealing the case and bringing it to General Montejo.
Cain escapes from Eddie when his men open fire on him and meets Anna again inside the hospital. McCoy calls and says that the cavalry is on the way to rescue Cain.
Later on, it is Anna who confirms that John Cain is indeed DEA, but he was recruited by the CIA to recover the case. So, we do not really know what Cain intended to do with the case. Cain is confused about whether he is the good guy or the bad guy.Anna recovers the case from the doctor's chamber. We also find out that the doctor actually helped Cain by making him forget his memories so that the bad guys (Eddie and the others) couldn't kill him.
It is revealed that the case has ""the names and addresses of the Illuminati"" ... ""the puppeteers and the puppets..."" [that run the world]. McCoy turns out to be another bad guy trying to get his hands on the case.""It's about order,"" says Anna to Cain, addressing the importance of the case. Keeping in mind how information is power during present times, any one person with all that intel (that can ""destroy the government,"" according to Anna) can certainly become an international threat, compromising relations among nations and causing disorder and chaos. When Cain went off the grid, he compromised the order. Perhaps because he realized how dangerous it could be in the hands of the wrong person. It was Cain's good fortune that his doctor hid it somewhere where no one could find it unless they looked hard. Anna did.
Cain remembers that he was in a romantic relationship with Anna.Cain attacks the remainder of Eddie's men and kills them all, just as McCoy arrives with his troops. Cain gets into McCoy's car with Anna. Turns out McCoy is crooked as well and wants his own hands on the case. McCoy believes that Anna was working for him, but Anna ends up attacking all of McCoy's men.Anna and Cain run away with the case after killing all of McCoy's men. Cain shoots McCoy as well, but it's only a flesh wound. No single organization should have the case in its possession. Such things should be destroyed unless there is a place where they can be locked away until the time comes to bring them out again."

Lullaby,2022,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11891246/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A new mother discovers a lullaby in an ancient book and soon regards the song as a blessing, but her world transforms into a nightmare when the lullaby brings forth the ancient demon Lilith. Rachel and John have just welcomed their newborn son, Eli, and get settled into their new apartment along with John's beloved childhood pet cockatoo.Prior to Eli's birth, Rachel's sister Vivian was hospitalized after the death of her own infant son Zachary, so their mother sent Zachary's old things for use by Rachel's new baby. While going through the boxes, Rachel discovers an old Hebrew children's book, and explores it with John (who has learned Hebrew following his religious conversion), and after finding the tune, Rachel sings it to Eli to put him to sleep.Shortly after, Rachel and John both begin to experience vivid hallucinations of an old hag. At one point, the apartment loses power, and Rachel runs out of the apartment following disturbances by the hag, insisting there is an intruder, and John investigates. Armed in the dark with a fireplace poker, John is startled by his cockatoo flying past him, and strikes it out of the air, killing it. John grieves, as it is a pet he has had since he was 11 years old. The incident culminates a series of small frustrations that begins to drive a wedge between Rachel and John.Finally, Rachel elects to visit Vivian in the hospital to try to get an explanation for the book. Vivian is shaken to hear Rachel has discovered the book, as she instructed her mother to discard it. Vivian explains to Rachel that the lullaby is a conjure song for Lilith, a demon in Jewish folklore who is said to be Adam's first wife in the Bible. According to the lore, Lilith was cast out of the Garden of Eden for her unwillingness to submit as Adam's wife. Wandering the earth alone, she gave birth to flawed and grotesque babies, as Adam and his new wife Eve gave birth to perfect ones - humans. In vengeance and jealousy, she becomes a demon, and spirits away the human babies of all those who sing her lullaby - a song initially sung to her by Adam, which she twisted into a summoning spell. Vivian tells Rachel that her son Zachary was not killed, but taken by Lilith, and they urgently must return to the apartment to protect Eli.Meanwhile, John visits the synagogue to receives help from the Rabbi. She informs him that Vivian came to her with the same concerns, but there is nothing she can do to help. Shortly after, John receives a mysterious phone call instructing him to come to a local address, where he will receive the answers he seeks. John arrives at the sequestered practice of Rabbi Cohen, who is known for performing Jewish services that will not be honored by the greater church, due to their taboo or unorthodox nature. John brings the book to Rabbi Cohen, and hears the story of Lilith. Rabbi Cohen explains that the hag haunting John and Rachel is a minion of Lilith known as the Crone. She is the first in a series of agents dispatched by Lilith to claim Eli. The next set of agents will be Lilith's own young, the Lilim - the grotesque, distorted babies birthed after her banishment. John is also informed that the accidental killing of his cockatoo was a deliberate part of Lilith's summoning ritual, which is the slaughter of a beast considered ""unclean"" to Judaism. This leaves the final ritual, which is the spilling of the blood of the infant to be taken by Lilith. If Eli sustains a bloody injury, the ritual will finalize, and he will be abducted and replaced with a dead golem.Rabbi Cohen sends John home with instructions on dispelling Lilith's agents, but does not allow him to leave with the lullaby book.Rachel and Vivian are the first to return to the apartment. Vivian covers the mirrors, warning that they are portals. Overwhelmed, Rachel hands Eli off to Vivian to step to the bathroom and recuperate. While there, she overhears Vivian singing Lilith's lullaby to Eli.Rachel carefully steps back into the room, finding Vivian in a chair cradling Eli, happily singing the lullaby. Vivian tells her that her plan is to prick Eli's finger to summon Lilith, and will follow behind Lilith to her realm to reclaim Zachary. She also reveals she never instructed her mother to discard the book, as she fully intended it to be found by Rachel. Vivian urges Rachel's trust, as this will ensure both Eli and Zachary are returned safely. Rachel feigns cooperation long enough to retrieve Eli from Vivian's arms and return him to his cradle. Rachel then attacks Vivian, and the two struggle in the hallway. Ultimately, an agent of Lilith arrives to cut Eli, and he is taken through a nearby standing mirror and replaced with a golem. Rachel stares down hopelessly at the golem in Eli's crib, until she turns to face the mirror and is pulled through by Vivian, who has already walked through.Rachel arrives in the first area of Lilith's realm, on the other side of the mirror, where she is able to see into Eli's room as though a window.

One night, the maniac chases driving a van and rams her, sending her crashing into another car. She awakens in the hospital, shrouded in darkness. The diagnosis is final: she lost her sight in the crash. Rita, a young woman from the Blind Society, helps Diana with her first steps in the darkness and in her new life; in the meantime, the police investigate, unsuccessfully. But it won't stop there. The Cellist must finish his work. Diana, helped by Chinese orphan Chin, can only try to escape. The cat and mouse game has just begun.—Urania Pictures In an almost deserted, summery Rome in the midst of a hypnotic solar eclipse, a mysterious serial killer starts targeting high-end prostitutes. Diana is one of them. In a desperate attempt to escape him, she becomes the victim of a serious car accident that leaves her blind. After a long period of rehabilitation, Diana learns that the only other survivor of the crash is a now-orphaned child of Chinese descent named Chin, and she decides to take care of him. Coming from different cultural backgrounds, the two connect via a special bond that allows them to defend themselves from the serial killer's thirst for revenge. Dario Argento returns to directing after a ten-year hiatus with a film that mixes the mood of Italian ""giallo"" pulp fiction in his early work with his legendary touch of horror, albeit this time with a dose of sharp irony thrown into the mix. Occhiali neri is a headlong dash between city and countryside that explores the social conflict between rich neighbourhoods and Rome's so-called Chinatown. The maestro's gaze transforms this nightmare into pure geometry, and the class war into the kind of metaphysical architecture reminiscent of Antonioni.—RobertUK"

They work hard and don't discriminate against anyone. All customers are welcome regardless of income, caste or any other parameter. Yet, prostitutes are discriminated against. She says that if brothels are removed, the city forced sex cases will rise and families will fall apart. She insists that brothel kids are also humans and have the right to education. She is applauded by the entire audience.
Gangu wants the local MLA to help her squash the court case, but the MLA says that matter is with the Supreme Court and only the PM Jawaharlal Nehru (Rahul Vohra) can now dispose of the petition. Gangu arranges for a meeting with the PM.PM grants her 15 mins. Gangu argues for legalization of prostitution. She says that when a girl is sold, the buyer and the seller go unpunished, only the girl is punished. She has no rights, no school no hospital, no bank, nothing. The PM agrees to not let them be homeless, but refuses to grant legal protection to prostitution as a profession.
Gangu returns to Kamathipura a hero and even Raziabai bows to her in respect."

As their sulky teenage daughter Ellie and her younger brother Steven wander around the cold rooms of their eerily-vacant new home, an intriguing wind-up gramophone in the living room suddenly catches their attention. And, without a doubt, there must be more treasures hidden in plain sight. But who knows what lies behind the kids' peculiar behaviour? What dark, hair-raising wonders lurk in the cellar?—Nick Riganas Brian and Kiera Woods move into an old decadent house with their two children Ellie(a teen) and Steven(an elementary child). Ellie immediately voices opposition from the beginning wishing to be back with her friends.The first night they are there, Kiera and Brian must go into the office for work, and leave Ellie to watch Steven, much to her dismay. Steven finds a secret room that contains older items, and has Ellie play the sonographe they found. It begins with a man reciting formulas and then counting up slowly. Ellie shuts it off before it reaches seven and tells Steven to go to bed.While Steven is sleeping and Ellie is watching TV, the power goes out and Ellie frantically calls her mother. Kiera has Ellie count up to 10, the number of the stairs down to the cellar where the breaker is located. Kiera notices that when Ellie gets to 10, she continues to count in a dreamlike manner. Brian and Kiera rush home to find Ellie missing and a search is sent out for her.The next day, unable to find Ellie the local police deem she has run away and will turn up in a few days, seeing as how she has a history of running away. Keira knows something is wrong and investigates herself.In the cellar she finds mysterious equations etched into the floor, and plant-based paint on the far wall in the forms of red haunted faces. After having the police look at it, they determine its from the 1950s and question who owned the house previously. Brian responds by saying they bought it for almost nothing at auction from an elderly woman.Later that night while Brian and Kiera are sleeping, Steven wakes Kiera up to tell her he has wet the bed. After helping and sending him back to bed, she hears whispering from the upstairs bathroom sink in the form of a girl counting up. As the counting continues she makes her way down to the cellar door. She opens the door and turns the light on before going down the steps to find nothing.The next day Kiera asks Brian what the different symbols above all the doors in the house mean. Kiera takes pictures of the symbols and goes into the office and has her coworker Erica find out what they mean. She tells her they are Hebrew glyphs that spell out ""Leviathen"", a sea creature of Jewish mythology.Later at the house Kiera plays the sonographe from earlier and Steven begins to count with it while walking towards the secret room. Kiera snaps him out of it. While researching the man in the portrait that hangs in the house, John Fetherston, the cellar door opens and the lights slowly go out. Steven calls for help from the cellar and Kiera goes to get him out of the closed Cellar, while looking through the keyhole she sees a monstrous eye only for Steven to ask her from behind who she's talking to as he's been asleep the whole time. The door opens slightly and the lights return. Kiera goes into the cellar, the lights off and the door swings shut. A growling is heard slowly ascending the steps after Kiera drops her phone down the stairs. She becomes frightened until Brian shows up and opens the door.Kiera tells Brian that something is down there, her phone disappeared and the people who used to own the house, the Fetherstons, all went missing except their daughter. Brian believes she's overreacting and goes down to look for her phone, finding animal hair instead, the phone gone.The next day Kiera goes to the National College of Mathematics to meet with Dr. Remi Fournet. She gives him the paper with the equation on it and he says it's ""Delta point vector sum epsilon partial I equals 1N DY by DX"", the same words from the sonographe. He tells her Fetherston was a colleague of Erwin Schroödinger at the college on a unity theory until his son became ill and then he completely disappeared. He tells her at first glance the equation is a representation of dimension(s) and is incredibly complicated. Kiera gets home with her new phone and Remi calls her asking if she's okay as he called and heard someone pick up who was counting. He then tells her a colleague of his stated the equation was created in the 12th century by alchemists, it was like an unfinished incantation. He also says there is a similar case of a house in Belgium with similar markings and everyone had disappeared as well.Brian gets upset with Kieras theories and so she takes him into the cellar to show him the symbols. While there, Steven walks toward the mysterious secret room. Brian tells Kiera she's being delusional and refuses to help her. He attempts to destroy the bottom step, unsuccessfully, and the sonographe turns on to count while Steven sees a cruel form of Ellie with symbols carved on her face and she counts in unison. Kiera and Brian run upstairs after he screams and Brian finds Ellies phone in the room.Kiera goes to visit Rose Fetherston at St Antonys private nursing home. Rose tells her it was her father who brought the dark entity into this world, to save her sick brother Jack. She tells Kiera it is Leviathen, one of the seven princes of hell who has gone by many names and is an ancient evil. She also tells her its not just the cellar, but the whole house.When Kiera gets home, Brian shows her the research he's done, that the shapes and symbols over the doors make a pentagon, which combined with Leviathen means ""Baphomet"", a goat-human with black wings, a demon worshipped by the occults Knight Templar. As they are talking, Steven follows his drone into the cellar as the sonographe plays. Baphomet appears and takes Steven as he reaches the bottom and the lights go out. They search for Steven with the lights out, the breaker not working, and find him in the secret room with a carving on his chest. Both he and Brian begin counting down from 48 and Kiera runs from Baphomet when they reach one, with the chase leading down the cellar stairs which are now very long leading to a lone door at the end.Kiera hides behind the door, and after Baphomet has gone, she continues walking down the passage way and finds what seems to be an endless crowd of people, all counting different numbers as they shuffle forward in a lifeless dimension. She finds Ellie after losing hope and brings her back, escaping Baphomet and yelling at him that he cannot take her family. She reunites with Brian and Steven.Together again she leads her family to the front door and opens it, revealing they never left the demons dimension and Ellie, Steven and Brian begin to count up turning away and walking into the cellar, and as the credits roll, Kiera joins in the counting.

Sofia also has a boyfriend named Hakim (Isnaba Na Montche), and Santo is fine with this, too, as long as the boy does not ever hurt his daughter. After the match, as a result of their win, Sofia is taken out by Santo for an off-road adventure in their car, as the girl has wanted to learn to drive on such terrain for a long time. During this day out, Sofia dearly wishes to take a picture of herself with her father to put up on social media, but Santo strictly tells her not to take any pictures of him. It has always been like this with Santo; he does not like or allow any of his family members to take any pictures of him. But Sofia is, of course, a teenager living in the Instagram world, and so she sneakily takes a photo of her father and puts it up on the internet. This photo seems to start a chain reaction somewhere in Milan as a group of menacing-looking men take a close look at the photograph.The very next day, Santo stays back for a while at his wood-sawing factory to look after the machinery and instead sends his brother-in-law Patrick (Luca Zamperoni) to pick Sofia up from practice. Patrick does so and takes the girl home, where he also spends some warm time with his sister Ingrid. However, this scene is quickly turned upside down when two armed men break into the house and kill Patrick and Ingrid. The attackers also take close pictures of Patrick's face and then realize that there is a third person in the house as well-young Sofia. While they spend some time looking for the girl, Sofia manages to stay hidden until the evening, when Santo also returns home. Stumbling upon the gruesome scene at his house, though, Santo spends no time mourning or trying to help his dead wife and instead takes his daughter away from the place. It seems the man has realized that the ghosts from his past are back for revenge.As Santo and Sofia get away from their house to a string of safe houses in an effort to evade their attackers, the man initially stays silent about what is going on and just keeps instructing his daughter around. But Sofia, after all, is her father's daughter, and soon she manages to throw a fit of rage enough for Santo to open up to her. It is now that Santo reveals that his name is not really Santo Romeo but Domenico Franze, and he was once part of the dangerous Sicilian mafia called the ""Ndrangheta.""
It was actually his family, the Franzes, who were part of the mafia syndicate. As part of his familial duties, which were in terms of the mafia rules, Santo, or Domenico, had stirred up trouble with their rival mafia family, the Lo Biancos. Santo had killed the eldest son of mafia don Angelo Lo Bianco (Remo Girone). Ever since then, Angelo Lo Bianco has been looking for Domenico Franze in order to exact revenge for the murder of his son.
But by that time, Santo had already seemingly fallen in love with a woman named Ingrid and had wanted to settle down and start a new life with her. He did not care much for all the violence and bloodshed and just wanted a way to get away from it all. It was due to this that he had fled from Milan and settled down in a remote town on the northern fringes of the country; he had also given up his given name of Domenico Franze and had instead taken on the identity of Santo Romeo. After the couple had their only child, Sofia, Santo was all the more determined to keep his wife and daughter safe from any harm and was resolute to never be found by the mafia again. This was precisely why he always kept insisting that nobody took pictures of him, for Santo is a man aware of the easy data breaches of the digital world.Don Angelo had gotten himself a new right-hand man, a tech expert by the name of Rudi Crisara (Francesco Villano). Before opening his own company, Crisara had worked with the government, and his expertise seems to be facial recognition technology. He had searched the internet with an old image of Domenico Franze and been led to the recent Instagram post by Sofia. The Lo Biancos sent their men to murder him and his family. However, the goons mistakenly killed the brother-in-law, Patrick, thinking that he was Santo, but Don Angelo could easily understand that they had missed their actual target. Since that first attack, the mafia keeps sending more men to track down and kill Santo and Sofia. While the two manage to escape each time, Sofia's boyfriend, Hakim, is killed by the criminals.As news of the double murder breaks out on television, the police identify the missing Santo as the notorious mafia henchman Domenico Franze, whom they, too, had been looking for all these years. With the police, as well as the mafia goons, all chasing him and his daughter, Santo decides to go to Milan to seek revenge himself.
Santo was stabbed in one of the attacks and loses consciousness. Sofia drives him to Milan and gets medical help from an warehouse that is a front for illegal abortions. Santo is operated on and bandaged. Dan Angelo's men track down Santo to the warehouse and attack. But Santo manages to evade them and shoots them down.
Since there is nobody else, he can entrust Sofia with, he decides to take the girl along with him as well and gradually give her training too. It just seems like Santo had been living a different life for all these years, but the brutal murder of his loved ones had sent him back to his old vicious self. In the knife-yielding training that he gives to Sofia, he ensures that the girl learns to use the knife, not in a way to kill her victim too quickly but instead in a way that would make her victim remember her face before dying.Moving on from such horrible parenting, Santo makes a marvelous plan for seeking revenge-while his whole situation was due to the fact that he had murdered the elder Lo Bianco son, he now plans to kidnap the younger son and hold him hostage. This younger son, Michele (Alessio Praticò), had also been introduced earlier, and the man is more invested in his duties as a businessman than those of a member of the mafia family. He is seen to have disagreements with his father as well but is not strong enough to overrule the Don's decisions. Michele says that this vendetta against Santo will cause harm to the family's business interests.Meanwhile, Don Angelo employs Rudi Crisara to now track down Santo and Sofia from the public traffic and security cameras in the city of Milan. Despite such measures, though, the ex-mafia henchman makes his way to the city and, together with the help of his daughter, kidnaps Michele Lo Bianco from his office. He then leaves a message for Don Angelo-the mafia boss is to confess to the police about all his crimes over the last thirty years and also to provide proper evidence about all his accomplices and network of funds, or else Santo will kill his younger son as well, just like he had killed his elder child.
Santo believes that Don Angelo might negotiate with him in order to save his son, but the mafia boss is more determined to save his reputation and business than to protect his often-disagreeable son. He sends more men to Santo and Sofia's location, and Santo has to fight them off alone to protect themselves from murder.Meanwhile, Sofia and Michele have been alone in the safe-house where Santo had kept Lo Bianco hostage, and Michele now tries to convince the girl that both of them are in a similar situation. Just like Sofia had been forced into this life of hiding and evading all of a sudden, Michele says, he too has been forced to be a part of his family's blood-thirsty violence. He also tells the girl that her father had killed his elder brother, and Sofia seems to question her father's actions, at least for a brief second. Just then, she receives a call from Santo, who explains that he has gone on a mission with no return.
Realizing that Don Angelo Lo Bianco would not stop at anything, Santo goes over to his lavish house, which also seems to be the mafia headquarters, and wipes out all the security all by himself. He then enters Angelo's room and strangles him to death. But Santo was very aware that such an action would very quickly draw the police onto him.
Knowing that his and his daughter's lives were too damaged anyway, Santo makes it seem like he is about to pull out a gun, and the police immediately shoot him dead. The authorities then also find out about the safe-house and rescue Michele and Sofia from there, with the latter being put up at a Catholic orphanage.As time goes by, Michele Lo Bianco visits the orphanage and meets with Sofia. He promises her that he wants to stop the unnecessary blood feud between the families of Lo Bianco and Franze and asks her to meet him once she leaves the orphanage. A few years seem to pass, and Sofia leaves the orphanage as soon as she turns eighteen. Still holding memories of her father very dear to her heart, she goes over to Michele's office to meet him. It becomes clear that Michele actually wanted to kill her, for he now wanted revenge for the death of his father and had sent Crisara to look for her at the orphanage. But Sofia herself is driven by the same intention, for she identifies herself as a Franze, as the member of the family that her father had fought for and given his life for as well. She now stabs Michele to his death and ensures that he remembers who killed him as he suffocates in his own blood for thirty seconds. With her revenge mission now complete, Sofia walks out into the city and blends in with the crowd, just like her father had tried to do. She will perhaps never again put up any pictures of herself on Instagram after all this."

My Son Hunter,2022,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt15481952/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Fictional retelling of the lifestyle and scandals of Hunter Biden, son of US President Joe Biden. ""This is not a true story ... except for all the facts.""This is the opening lines of the movie, voiced by an omniscient narrator, played out by a Secret Service agent who appears through the movie. In this setup, the movie starts off.Next a series of news snippets are inter played as the media is shown portraying the 2019 protests by BLM and Antifa in a manner that satirizes the situation, juxtaposing actual scenes of arson against the news anchor's statements of peaceful protests. Two protesters are then shown discussing the suppression of information for ""the good of the people.""This morphs into the first scene of Hunter Biden, and one of his many parties that throw around cash, sex, and drugs. At the end of this first scene, with the revelers mostly asleep and strung out, there is a humorous presentation of a small dog, using dialog bubbles to tell Biden he's being used by freeloaders who don't really care about him. Agreeing with the dog, Biden orders everyone out of his apartment.We then see Hunter meet up with another recurring character in the movie, named Grace Anderson, who spends much of the movie as a combination of Hunter's girlfriend, savant, and moral conscience. Her first interactions show Hunter entering a drug purchase, followed by the first of many intimate conversations about their lives and troubles.Next enters Joe Biden into the movie, meeting with his son Hunter in the back of a Vice-Presidential motorcade, discussing the laptop that Hunter Biden abandoned at a computer repair store. They discuss how the laptop became the property of the store owner. They discuss how the FBI now has the laptop and how Joe Biden needs to know what's on the laptop so he can work to create cover stories in the media.This limo scene is interrupted by scenes of Grace meeting with one of Hunter's personal assistants. This assistant then works with Grace to try to find web articles to discuss what Hunter had previously told her took place. Being unable to find any information that matched what Hunter had told her took place, Grace is told she must find other websites to find the background information she seeks. Grace then consults those other websites and finds her corroborating information.The Secret Service agent then provides a brief summary of the convictions these Biden associates received, while describing some of their most significant criminal actions, as well as the financial details of the Hunter Biden business deals. This is when the movie first portrays Joe Biden telling an audience how he forced the resignation of a Ukrainian prosecutor, who was investigating Hunter, in return for a $1 billion loan guarantee by the Obama administration.The story then returns to the limo, where Hunter and Joe Biden end their conversation with the mention of removal of travel bans against Ukrainian and Russian oligarchs in return for Hunter no longer being prosecuted, along with revealing a smear campaign against the computer store owner by portraying him as a Russian agent.Following this, is another extended scene between Hunter Biden and Grace Anderson, where the two discuss the Peoples Republic of China. In this exchange, details of Hunter's business deals with Chinese business leaders are played out in character. It is during this scene where the apartment manager evicts Biden due to the salacious nature of his many parties. This extended scene concludes with Anderson speaking about Chinese human rights violations, as well as confronting Hunter on the true roots of his actions and self-destructive behavior.Hunter Biden's personal assistant then gives to Grace a recording of her many conversations with Hunter Biden, a recording she tries to give to a freelance journalist named Bob, who is working at the time for the Washington Post. This journalist is shown as refusing to accept the story and urging Grace to forget all about it. Grace then posts the information she has online, and is shown immediately suffering social media cancellation and attacks.The final scenes play out showing Rudy Giuliani accepting Grace's invitation to meet, releasing the recordings. The movie concludes by showing the aftermath of the public release of these conversations, prior to the 2020 election, that force the FBI to accelerate their criminal investigation of Hunter Biden, as well as force mainstream media to retract their previous denials of the laptop information. This culminates in a revisionist outcome of the 2020 election in which Donald Trump is re-elected by a wide margin, presumably due to the controversy created after the media reports the details of the Biden business deals and Hunter Biden's personal lifestyle, as well as other media reports of Hunter Biden being arrested by the FBI for various charges.These revisionist narratives are then stopped, showing a concluding scene of Grace refusing to release the recordings, and lamenting what could have been if she had done so. She reconciles with her estranged father in an embrace and final statement that perhaps, ""in the end, the truth itself has become the fairy tale.""The movie fades out with several real world media clips as well as actual video of Joe and Hunter Biden and their activities. These clips show 2020 efforts by mainstream media to castigate the New York Posts' laptop articles as being Russian disinformation, followed by reports they made in 2021 and 2022 that the laptop information is genuine."

They struggle to find a way home with a badly injured friend while from the waters below predators lurk. Five friends (Nat, her boyfriend Tom, Milly, Tyler and Greg) are partying in Mexico for Spring Break on their last night. Nat goes to buy more beers and a beggar asks her for money. Noticing her noticing his legs, he tells her a great white chomped down on them. Her friends arrive and despite the man not being scary, they treat him poorly and he tells them to be careful.The next morning, to recover, they steal some jet skis and head out to sea. After a lot of mucking about, Greg and Nat's ski crashes into the other. Greg's leg gets broken and both jet skis are damaged with one sinking. After congregating on the remaining dead jet ski, they set Greg's leg and ponder their next move. When Nat tries to get phone signal on Milly's phone, she finds pictures of Milly and Tom among messages discussing an affair. In a bad mood, she fights Tom over it and loses the phone. Tom goes to recover it and somehow finds it on the sea bed.They realize they're drifting further from land and begin to panic. Tyler decides, as the strongest swimmer, that he'll go off in search of help. Shortly after he leaves, the group spot a great white fin heading towards them. The ski is knocked and they all go flying into the water. Nat's hair gets caught in Greg's watch and the remaining two watch in horror as Greg is attacked by the shark, dragging Nat down into the deep alongside him. Finally, she's able to break the watch and escape while Greg becomes shark food.Tyler is seen swimming and spies a boat. He begins yelling and trying to get the attention of the fisherman whose music is (naturally) too loud. Not too loud, though, to drown out Tyler's screams after the shark bites him. However, the fisherman is obviously dumb and takes his time looking for the source of the yells because by the time he looks in Tyler's direction, he's dead.Milly begins wondering what they'll do if Tyler gets eaten by a shark and Tom tells her to shut up.Nightfalls and they spot a red light in the distance. Realising it's a beacon, Nat goes to find help. However, instead she finds a mauled man in a life-jacket.The next morning, driftwood from the unfortunate victim's boat reaches them and they use wood to fashion ores and begin paddling. As Milly can't swim, Nat gets the life-jacket off the corpse and gives it to her. Inexplicably, the shark attacks and bites Tom. Bad CGI follows. Nat manages to stab it in the eye and it goes away. They realize they can't out paddle the shark and their only hope is to get the engine started. Unfortunately, it's under the seat and they'd need to get off the ski to open up. They devise a plan to stay safe while fixing the engine but the shark attacks again, sending all three in different directions. As Milly shrieks for help, Nat swims to her, but Tom, in the jaw of the great white comes between them and is launched into the air. Nat ops to save Tom first and gets him back to the ski. She attempts to save Milly but the shark gets her first, chomping her in half. Nat drops what's left of Milly into the ocean.Nat again sets about getting to the engine and snaps some rusty metal off the guard before getting into the engine box. Tom, from blood loss and dehydration is fading fast so Nat keeps him talking to keep him present. She notices a broken cable that needs some plastic tubing and sets about swimming to Milly's corpse to get the life-jacket back. As she's on her way back, the shark attacks and Nat uses the broken metal to defend herself.She appears before Tom and manages to get the tubing connected and the engine running. But the shark is faster than the ski and takes a bite out of the ski's hind quarters. As it starts to slow down, Tom slips off into the water and unwraps his wounds to draw the shark. Nat makes a half hearted plea to get him back on but she recognizes she's better off without him and leaves him to die, as she should.As she approaches land, shallow rocks begin giving her grief and tear into the ski, eventually throwing her off. In a final chase, she manages to escape the shark.and makes it to the shore where she cries and enjoys the sand. Somehow after two days without protection she's still milky white! Good for her."

Arctic Void,2022,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9183978/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"When the power mysteriously fails, and almost everyone vanishes from a small tourist vessel in the Arctic, fear becomes the master for the three who remain. Forced ashore, the men deteriorate in body and mind until a dark truth emerges that compels them to ally or perish. TV host Ray Marsh (Michael Weaver) and his director/producer Alan Meursault (Tim Griffin) get their trip to Norway off on a bad start from the beginning when they arrive at a small Norwegian airport with no transportation arranged to take them to the boat where they need to be. They get lucky and find a ride through a local that Ray chats up outside, but this proves to be perhaps the last plot development that breaks their way.Just before boarding, the two manage to link up with their cameraman Sean Tibbets (Justin Huen), a local they find on eerily short notice to come shoot the series for them. Something about Sean seems a little bit off, and those suspicions are confirmed when Ray opens a lunchbox that their third wheel carts around ... only to find a sound system and a set of headphones. They each take a listen, Ray for a bit longer, to hear the odd whale sounds emitted by the device.Sean does his job well enough on board, capturing footage of the charismatic captain Jim (Rune Temte) as well as the various contingents of Swedish tourists, Germans, and Norwegian scientists on board. Alan chats up the latter and learns they are on board to study the region's auroras. As they explain, these are powerful geostorms with the hypothetical power to disable electronic technology - perhaps even the human brain.Not long after the passengers witness a large seal with some conspicuous open wounds brutally mauling a younger animal of its own kind on an ice flow, Sean begins to notice a few other things off on the deck. A man seems to be bleeding out of his ear, and a flock of birds begins to circle ominously. Then, in a moment ... everyone disappears. Everyone, that is, except Sean, Ray, and Alan.The core duo emerges from below deck and tries to figure out where everyone went; Sean lies and says he was in the bathroom when it all went down. None of the electronics work, including the boat itself. Alan begins bleeding from strange gashes. They soon piece together that their fellow passengers did not just disembark so much as they completely disappeared.The trio takes a raft ashore to Svalbard, their original destination, to find no signs of life. Inside an abandoned building, odd and ominous harbingers of abandoned humanity abound like a flickering TV and a skipping Russian record. Alan's condition further deteriorates, as does his trust in Sean. That confidence completely evaporates when he turns on the digital camera from one of the Germans as they videoed each other just prior to their disappearance ... and he spots Sean filming from the deck, thus exposing his dishonesty.When Ray confronts Sean, their shady cameraman finally admits that he is an ex-military operative assigned to document the effects of the exposure to a sonic weapon. Humans are supposed to be merely disoriented by it, not entirely vaporized. His lunchbox headphones provide a countering vibration to the weapon's frequency, inoculating the listener but not saving them entirely.Alan becomes too weak to leave on the raft, and Ray asks him to film a video on his phone for the family he'll be leaving behind. Sensing a threat, Ray puts the phone and camera inside a waterproof pouch and chunks it out to sea. Walking and talking with Sean, his walkie-talkie lights up with a message: ""We have your location. Extraction in 30 minutes.""They transport Alan out of the building in a wheelbarrow, and Ray stays behind with him as Sean goes outside to meet the people who make eye contact. Alan continues to teeter on the verge of death. Shortly after he expires, Ray presses his necklace with a jack on it - a totem expressing his anguish over the loss of a sibling he couldn't save at the age of 10 - into his friend's hands.In the throes of his grief, Ray hears a gunshot ring out. Sean takes a sniper's bullet to the back of the head. Inside the room with Ray, an old phone begins to ring ... and rings ... and rings.After the credits, the camera bag continues to float in search of someone to discover it. (thanks to decider)"

Kantara,2022,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt15327088/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"When greed paves the way for betrayal, scheming and murder, a young tribal reluctantly dons the traditions of his ancestors to seek justice. Depicting Supreme God Vishnu's third incarnation on earth called Varaha avatar. The forest tribal community devote to Varaha and considers Bhootha Kola (divine dance of coastal Karnataka) performer to Rudra (Lord Shiva) who is gatekeeper of the community and protects every devotee of Lord Varaha from evil spirits (living/dead). A promise of ancestors is under threat to be breached by people over lust of materialistic gains where the ancient King had made deal with demigods as bargain for his peace. With such powerful story line, excellent performance by every actor keeping raw background showing beautiful traditional practices of coastal Karnataka in an ultimate showdown of good vs evil. In 1847, a King is happily living with his family and empire but what he does not have is peace and goes to search it at various places. He comes to a tribal village where he sees Daiva which could offer him peace but he has to give some forest land to the tribal people in order to seek peace. The King agrees but the tribals warn him that Daiva's family will follow their deity and if anyone goes back from their word it will lead to wrath. Many years later in 1970, the village is living as per the word of the King by performing Bhootha Kola festival where the deity turns a temporary God and tries to solve village problems but the current successor of the King has become greedy and wants the land back. In 1990, 20 more years later, it's revealed that the King's successor who tried to take the land back died a mysterious death. Shiva, a troublesome villager is the current successor of Bhootha Kola but refuses to do it since twenty years back he saw his father disappear while doing the act. Murali, a forest officer, tries to convey that the village land comes under forest and anyone objecting and breaking rules will face the brunt, while he also objects to Kola festival. But Shiva who works for Sahib, current successor of the King, objects to Murali and a rift is created between the two. While Murali and Shiva are thirsty for each other's blood, they realize a shocking truth that they all are scapegoats in a plan.—alex.mjacko@gmail.com In 1800s, a King trades his forest land to a demigod for peace of mind. The demigod gives the land to the tribals and warns the King that should he or his descendants seek to get the lands back there would be disastrous consequences. Cue 1990 and there's conflict between government, land owners, descendants and tribal over the ownership of forests. Myth and reality conflate to yield a rousing resolution.—guru-krishnan In 1847, there lived a king (Vinay Biddappa) that had a great kingdom as well as a loving wife (Pragathi Rishab Shetty) and child, but could not find peace. He sets out on a journey to discover true happiness and comes upon a stone in a forest occupied by Panjurli Daiva, a deity that protects the villagers that reside in the forest. He donates vast amounts of his land to the villagers in exchange for taking the stone with him. Panjurli warns the king that his family and successors should keep their word and not reclaim the land, which will incur the wrath of Panjurli's companion, the ferocious Guliga Daiva.In 1970, the King's successor asks a Bhoota Kola performer, who is possessed by Panjurli to make the locals hand over the land to him, which the performer refuses and states he will die vomiting blood if he tries to. The successor now lives in the city and knows that the value of the land has increased multi-fold. He needs to money to reclaim his lost royal status and lifestyle. The successor raises doubt on performer's possession by Panjurli, to which the performer replies he would vanish if he is possessed, after which he runs into the forest and is indeed never seen again. As warned, the king's successor dies mysteriously, vomiting blood a few months later on the steps of the court, where he was going to argue the land case.In 1990, Murali (Kishore), a forest officer, is tasked with converting the villagers' land into a forest reserve. However, he is challenged by Shiva (Rishab Shetty), a Kambala athlete from the Kaadubettu village and the missing performer's son. Shiva is backed by his patron and the village's landlord, Devendra Suttooru (Achyuth Kumar), who is the king's successor in the present. Although Shiva is continually asked to perform the Bhoota Kola, he refuses due to the trauma of his father's disappearance.
Sudhakara (Pramod Shetty) is Suttoo's PA. Sudhakara had rigged the results of the Kambala buffalo races to ensure that Shiva came in 2nd and Suttoo's buffaloes came first. Shiva beats up Sudhakara publicly and forces Suttoo to declare him the winner with a medal and motorbike as the prize. Kamala (Manasi Sudhir) is Shiva's mother.
Shiva and his friends (Lacchu (Ranjan Saju), Raampa (Prakash Thuminad)) hunt wild boars on the forest land, while the villagers get supplies for Bhoot Kola from the forest. Murali objects to all of this and wants to fence off the forest area at the earliest. Devendra knows that Murali is tasked with identifying and fencing off the forest reserve. He tries to cozy upto Murali, but Murali is not a compromising type of person.Shiva's cousin Guruva (Swaraj Shetty) takes his place at the hoot Kola. Murali and his staff start erecting a fence along the earmarked forest reserve. Shiva falls in love with a woman named Leela (Sapthami Gowda) and uses his connections with Devendra to appoint her as a forest guard. Leela also falls for Shiva and they both have sex.
The villagers try to stop the fencing but the police and forest guards (including Leela) brutally suppress them, creating a rift between Leela and Shiva even though she was following orders and could do nothing about the situation. Murali wants the villagers to relocate their village outside of the forest area.
Meanwhile Devendra helps launch a legal defense by gathering all the property papers of the villagers, to prove that the village is not an encroachment on the forest land. Devendra is helped by his lawyer (Naveen D Padil).
Shiva continues to help DEvendra by helping him cut down trees inside the forest and transporting the wood outside to Devendra's mills.As the feud between Murali and Shiva intensifies, Murali decides to arrest Shiva and his friends and heads to their hideout along with Devendra's henchman Surendran (Deepak Rai Panaaje). However, Shiva and his friends who were cutting down a tree accidentally destroy Murali's jeep in the process, and thinking they killed everyone inside, go into hiding. A few days later, they return to the village to meet their families; Shiva makes up with Leela and tells her that he will surrender. However, they are caught by the police and forest guards the morning after. Guruva asks Devendra to bail Shiva, but Devendra tries to bribe him to act as if Panjurli orders the villagers to give him their land in the next Bhoota Kola. Guruva refuses and Devendra kills him; learning that Murali has figured out his ulterior motive, Devendra decides to set Shiva against him.
Murali finds out that Devendra has got all the villagers to transfer their land in his name, and now Devendra is the one responding to the court notices on evacuation of the village. Murali figures out a way to declare the reserve forest boundary which will make all of Devendra's papers null and void.Having learned about Guruva's death, Shiva meets Devendra, who lies about Murali being Guruva's killer. Enraged, Shiva goes to kill Murali, but learns from his friend Mahadeva the blacksmith that Devendra himself killed Guruva. Shiva is attacked by Devendra's henchmen, but manages to escape and meet the villagers, whom Murali has told about Devendra's land seizure. After Shiva reveals that Devendra killed Guruva, he and Murali set aside their grudge and unite the village. Devendra and his henchmen attack, leading to an intense battle where several of the villagers are killed. After nearly dying in the fight, Shiva hits his head against Panjurli's stone, gets possessed by the Guliga Daiva, and kills Devendra and his henchmen.A few months after the battle, Shiva performs the Bhoota Kola where he is possessed by Panjurli. He, Murali, and the villagers join hands in a symbolic gesture and blesses the villagers and he then disappears into the forest after meeting what seems to be his father's spirit. The film ends with Shiva and Leela's son asking Sundara about his father's disappearance and Sundara narrating the same."

Govinda reveals that he had found out that Suku had betrayed him and was working for Vishnu. He, along with Gauri and Asha, had made an elaborate plan in which they would fake Gauri's death to get the insurance money, steal and sell the drugs from Sandy by framing Inspector Javed, and sell the bungalow for a hefty sum, fully aware that it was illegally acquired.

Warriors of Future,2022,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7375466/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A meteorite brings an extraterrestrial life to the earth. When powerful alien creatures threaten humanity, Commander Sing Lee's elite forces are almost wiped out, and the surviving soldier Tai Loi discovers an even bigger conspiracy. In 2055, wars have ravaged the Earth due to the prevalent use of advanced military robots, and global warming and pollution have destroyed the environment and ruined the atmosphere. As a result, many people are born with birth defects and die, and large domes known as Skynets are built to protect the surviving cities on Earth. During the construction of the Skynet over B-16 (a futuristic Hong Kong), a meteor lands in the city and a giant alien plant, later named Pandora, emerges and causes devastation to the area around it as it takes root. Pandora grows rapidly when there is rain, taking over more of the city every time it does so; however, it is discovered that the plant can also purify the polluted air. ASU's (a local military force) lead scientist, Dr Chan (Tse Kwan-ho), finds a way to alter the plant's genome to stop Pandora from growing further while also letting it continue to repair the atmosphere.
B-16 is going to get 2 rainstorms. The 1st rainstorm will only deliver 10 mm of rain, but the 2nd will deliver 160 mm of rain, allowing Pandora to grow and take over the entire B-16 and its 5.6 million population will be in danger.Tyler (Louis Koo) (principal force of B-16's Air Force who possesses extraordinary skills in operating fighter jets) and his friend Johnson Cheng (Sean Lau) (commander of B-16's Air Force and Tyler's brother-in-arms), soldiers working for the ASU, are tasked with locating Pandora's pistil and delivering a ""gene bullet"" virus that will neutralize its growth. Colonel Tam (Carina Lau) is sent to oversee the operation, but she has a backup plan to bomb Pandora from the air (before the 2nd rainstorm hits), which would destroy the plant but could potentially kill a hundred and sixty thousand people in the surrounding area. Cheng figures that Tam doesn't know a lot about how Pandora would react to the attack. They don't know how much time they will have to escape once the gene bullet is fired into the pistil.
Cheng heavily opposes the idea of sacrificing civilians and losing their best chance to fix the atmosphere, and launches the mission before two rainstorms hit the city. Privates Connor (Wan Guopeng) and Lincoln join Tyler on the mission as they escort the Orca transport aircraft carrying the gene bullet virus into the operation area. During the mission, Sean Li (Nick Cheung), the commander in chief of B-16 and the architect of the Skynet project, sabotages the Orca by remotely taking control of its complement of military robots as soon as the first storm hits, and it crashes into a building. Damaged by Pandora's tendrils, Tyler's aircraft crashes after locating the area where the pistil is, and Lincoln is left critically injured.Connor and Tyler look for medical supplies at an abandoned hospital, where they are attacked by mantis-like creatures which kill Lincoln. Connor hides in the mortuary while Tyler retreats to an emergency room where he rescues an orphaned girl, Pansy, who reminds Tyler of his daughter Sissy, who had died of pollution-caused illness. Cheng, arriving in an armored car driven by former-squad mate Skunk/Yau Tai-long (Philip Keung) (a former member of B-16's Air Force who was dismissed after committing a major mistake and became at odds with Tyler. He was later recruited by Johnson to rejoin the force to participate in the plan to alter the genetics of ""Pandora""), uses a hatchet to kill most of the mantis-like creatures while Tyler rescues Connor. The survivors escape the hospital and head to the building where the Orca crashed, finding the last intact gene bullet capsule and evidence that Li had sabotaged the mission in order to allow Pandora to be destroyed and the construction of his Skynets to continue. The team contact Li, saying that they have the evidence of his sabotage, but Li proposes a challenge: to beat him, they will have to go against the military robots under his control.As the team race towards the location of the pistil, Li sends several tank-like and humanoid robots after the armored car. As Skunk drives on, Tyler, Connor and Cheng fight off the robots, and Cheng becomes separated from the group after being thrown out of the car, in an attempt to fight off one of the larger robots. The others arrive at the location where the pistil is and encounter a large crab-like robot, with its pulse weapon destroying the armored car. Connor, Skunk and Tyler fight off more humanoid robots and destroy the crab-like robot, and Cheng returns and saves Pansy. Cheng enters the pistil chamber just as Pandora begins to grow uncontrollably as the second storm hits. Cheng unleashes the gene bullet virus onto Pandora, stopping it from growing further. Colonel Tam suspends the backup plan after discovering Li's sabotage, and Li commits suicide before she can arrest him. Afterwards, with the state of the atmosphere greatly improving, Tyler accepts a mission on the moon while Skunk and Cheng finish rebuilding the armored car."

Set in 1940s Calcutta, Qala is about the tumultuous relationship between an aspiring singer and her domineering mother.
The movie begins with Qala Manjushree (Tripti Dimri) who has just won the ""Golden Vinyl"". She is being interviewed by several journalists who mention her brother whom her mother tried to launch into the music industry 9 yrs ago. Distraught, Qala replies that she has no brother. In a flashback, her mother Urmila (Swastika Mukherjee) who was pregnant with twins gives birth to Qala, but her brother does not survive (as Qala was stronger and took away the nutrients from the weaker sibling in the womb). Urmila attempts to smother Qala, but Qala survives. Urmila teaches Qala the art of music but warns her against being a courtesan. Urmila warns Qala that as a girl she will have to work harder to be successful in the world. She really wanted a boy to carry forward the legacy of her husband, who was a music maestro.In the present, Qala is haunted by visions of a teenage boy who accuses her of taking what is rightfully his. A doctor advises Qala to rest. Urmila has ignored all attempts by Qala to get in touch with her. Qala seeks acceptance of her honor by Urmila, but is only met by a stony silence. She doesn't drink milk and is using sleeping pills to get some shut eye.
In another flashback, Qala is being taught music to perform in 3 days but Urmila chides her and accuses her of not working hard enough. Urmila locks Qala out in the freezing snow. At the performance, few people show up (as Gandhiji was visiting the area and the masses had gone to attend his rally) and Qala is upstaged by an orphan, Jagan (Babil Khan), the same teenage boy from Qala's visions. while Qala's performance was in front of an empty theatre, it got full when Jagan was performing.
Urmila takes a liking to Jagan's music and brings him home to live with her. Qala is jealous of Jagan. It was Qala's duty to serve milk to Jagan. Urmila wants Qala to become Jagan's assistant singer during his performances.In the present, a renowned singer - Chandan Lal Sanyal (Sameer Kochhar) dies. In another flashback, her mother seduces Sanyal (Qala sees Sanyal in Urmila's chambers at night and Urmila in various stages of undress) to obtain a chance for Jagan to sing with him. Jagan knows that working with Sanyal in the film industry can lead to working with Sumant Kumar and even a golden vinyl. To further Jagan's career, Urmila attempts to marry Qala off but Qala declines. Qala wants to marry Jagan, so she can stay with Urmila, but Urmila is disgusted by the thought of a sister marrying her brother.
Urmila hosts a party and invites several influential people. At the party, Qala feels invisible but is noticed by Sanyal, whom she kisses.
Unfortunately, Jagan falls sick during his performance and cannot sing so Qala sings instead, impressing the guests. Jagan gets sicker to the point of losing his voice, but is cared for by Urmila. Sumant Kumar comes to Urmila's home and wants to sign Jagan for his next song. He is confident that Jagan will sing again. Qala seduces Sumant Kumar (Amit Sial) (in the same way that Urmila seduced Sanyal) to obtain a chance at recording a song, taking Jagan's place.
That night Jagan talks to Qala one last time before he hangs himself in the forest. The next day, Qala discovers his body and hugs his corpse. Her mother is distraught and cradles Jagan in her hands.In the present, Sumant begs Qala to sing a song for his new film, but she even refuses to meet him.

Urmila forbids Qala from coming back to their house ever again. Qala leaves for Calcutta for her recording session with Sumant. She is nervous and cannot sing even on the 11th take. She was forced to provide oral pleasure to Sumant, for a last chance. She recalls Jagan, who used to sing for himself. Taking his words into account, she successfully records the song. Qala slowly rises to fame as a singer. During this period, she continues to be a sexual partner for Sumant.She becomes close with Majrooh (Varun Grover), the songwriter who advises her to cease her arrangement with Sumant. While being interviewed by journalists again, she sees a vision of Jagan. While recording a song, she breaks down and sees snow falling all around her. Her mother hears her interview being broadcast over the radio.
In a flashback, it is revealed Qala dropped a globule of mercury into Jagan's milk before his performance, leading to his cough and subsequent loss of voice.

Bayou spends years writing to her, but none of his letters reach Leanne. Eventually, however, they meet each other again, but this time, the situation is a lot direr than it was before. Now, Leanne is passing as a white person and is married to the man who is to be the mayor of the town which is racist, through and through. While Leanne feels trapped in a marriage that she was forced into by her mother, seeing Bayou again gives her hope. However, their reunion is short-lived when Leanne's mother wrongfully accuses Bayou of whistling at Leanne. This angers the white men of the town and they decide to make Bayou pay for it. Before they can kill him, he runs away to Chicago.From the beginning of the film, we find a strong sibling rivalry between Willie Earl and Bayou, with a major part of it exhibited by the older sibling. Bayou is treated as an outcast within his family, and his father favors Willie Earl, mainly because he learned to play the trumpet quicker. While Bayou has a beautiful voice, he could never do what his father wanted, while Willie Earl dedicated himself to the man. When their father leaves for Chicago, Willie Earl doesn't bat an eye before following him, even though he is told not to.Sheltered by his father, Willie Earl grew up believing that he was better than Bayou in every aspect. While he was good at playing trumpet, his talent didn't make him stand out. Still, much like his father, Willie Earl was delusional about his abilities. He had big dreams and he might even have achieved them, but he was simply not dedicated enough for it, unlike Bayou. It was Willie Earl's plan to go to Chicago and become a successful musician. He spends years in the city, to no avail. When he crosses paths with Ira, he thinks he might finally have it all. But then circumstances lead to Bayou accompanying them on the trip, which is where everything starts to go south for Willie Earl.Ira knew that Willie Earl needed something more if he wanted to make it as a musician. The spark that he lacked, Ira finds in Bayou. When the time comes to audition, it is Bayou who stays and actually auditions, as opposed to Willie Earl who leaves when the first trouble comes along the way. Still, Ira gets the gig for both brothers, tagged along with the actual deal that is signed by Bayou. As his younger brother flourishes, Willie Earl's career starts to go downhill. He gets hooked on drugs, which further affects his work ethic. As Bayou finds more success, Willie Earl becomes jealous of him. He starts resenting him for taking away what should have been rightfully his. He was the one who followed after their father and spent all that time in Chicago trying to make it. But here was Bayou, who had things served to him on a silver platter and took everything away that Willie Earl had worked for.The final straw for Willie Earl arrives when he is fired. He doesn't stop to think that his addiction and the problems that he created at the workplace might have something to do with it. Instead, he blames it all on Bayou and he wants him to pay for it. It is when Bayou decides to go back home that his older brother finds his opportunity. Everyone knew how dangerous it was for Bayou to be there. But Bayou reckons that Leanne's husband and his brother would probably not remember him because enough time had passed. Once back in town, Willie Earl goes straight to the sheriff and not only reminds him about Bayou but also tells him exactly where to find his brother. This leads the mob to descend on Bayou and kill him."

Under Her Control,2022,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt15006754/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"When a fashion employee thinks she will have to end her promising career after getting pregnant, her boss offers to adopt the child. Beatriz (Aitana Sánchez-Gijon) wanted a baby, and Sofia (Cumelen Sanz) wanted to abort the baby she was going to have. The ladies were in different phases of life. Both lived in Madrid. Sofia had a boyfriend named Nacho.Beatriz had achieved everything in her life professionally, and Sofia, on the other hand, was still starting out. She wanted to make money, do good in her career, and make a name for herself. Sofia had a bachelor's degree in finance from the University of Buenos Aires, and she said that she had completed her master's in international trade and also had done an MBA.Sofia appeared for an interview for a job with Beatriz.
Beatriz got a call in the middle of the interview, and she asked Sofia to answer it, trying to assess how she handled the situation. Beatriz was impressed by Sofia and offered her a job. Sofia, too, felt like she had met a wonder woman. She was in awe of Beatriz. Beatriz had created everything from scratch, and Sofia idolized her. Beatriz hires Sofia as her assistant.
Nacho (Alex Pastrana), Sofia's boyfriend, wanted to take things forward. He wanted to buy a flat and move in with Sofia. He had already seen a place, but Sofia had different plans.
Sofia realizes that she is pregnant. Meanwhile, we see that Beatriz knows that she has everything, but she has a hole in her life. Sofia values her career and wants to terminate her pregnancy. She never tells Nacho that she is pregnant.Beatriz did not know that Sofia was pregnant. Once she got to know (Sofia got sick in the office), she thought that it might be a hindrance to her work. She felt a bit annoyed that Sofia hadn't told her about the pregnancy earlier. But all of a sudden, she realized that she could use the situation to her benefit. She asked Sofia to be a surrogate mother for her. Beatriz's family lawyer explains that Beatriz will be noted as the mother in all official documents from the start and her family doctor will handle the delivery. Everything has to be kept a secret.
Now, this kind of arrangement is illegal in the eyes of the law. Beatriz told her to live with her for the duration of the pregnancy. She offered her a handsome amount and said to her that all her expenses would be taken care of.In the negotiations, Sofia asked to double the amount she was offering, and, in addition to that, she also asked for two trips to Argentina every year. Beatriz agreed to it, and Sofia told Nacho that she had to move to London for work.
She moved into Beatriz's house, situated on the outskirts of the city. Beatriz was a control freak. She liked staying in command. She had cameras all over her place. When Sofia realized that she had cameras, she asked her to remove them, at least the ones that were inside the house. Sofia didn't want to be spied on.
Tati (Rocío Setjo) is the house maid, but she does not speak English. Sofia finds a locked room upstairs, which she finds is a nursery for the new baby. Beatriz has already named the baby Carlos.One day Sofia's mobile disappeared. It was nowhere to be found. Sofia couldn't talk to Nacho. He got all paranoid as it was pretty unusual for Sofia to not reply to his calls. Nacho was completely unaware of this arrangement. Sofia had only told him that she was going to London for work. Beatriz didn't like it when she talked to Nacho. She felt that he would come and not let her take the baby. He was the father and legally he could do so.Beatriz wanted the baby, and she didn't want any sort of complications to arise in between. Beatriz wanted Sofia to exercise, eat, rest, and adhere to the advice of the family doctor. If the doctor said that Sofia had to do 50 laps of the swimming pool, Beatriz made sure that she did exactly the same.
Beatriz fires Tati for letting Sofia into the nursery.
The question arises whether Beatriz wanted to kill Sofia after the pregnancy. In all probability, Beatriz would have killed Sofia after she had given birth to her baby. When Beatriz was talking to her family doctor, Christina (Vanessa Rasero), we got to know what she thought of the situation that Sofia was in. Christina thought that it was a difficult position to be in.But Beatriz believed that Sofia was on a paid vacation, and she had no reason to complain. She thought that the girl had everything that she once desired and her life had upgraded rather quickly and conveniently. Beatriz buys Sofia a new phone.
Sofia did talk to Nacho, and she broke down on the call. Beatriz didn't like the idea of Sofia connecting to people from her past life. She sat in front of her while she talked to her boyfriend. It became very uncomfortable for Sofia. She even told Beatriz that the next time she talked to him, she would appreciate it if Beatriz wasn't sitting on her head and noticing everything.
Beatriz had a network jamming device in her house. She couldn't stop Sofia from using her phone, but she could jam her network.Sofia did not graduate from the universities as she had told in the interview. She didn't hold a masters, and she had faked her whole portfolio. She wanted to earn quick money. She didn't mind if she was betraying Nacho, her boyfriend, or not. She did feel guilty, but as compared to the huge amount of money she was getting offered, the guilt didn't last for long. Sofia was an opportunist.But halfway through, Sofia realized that Beatriz was not somebody she pretended to be. Sofia started feeling claustrophobic because, evidently, her freedom was taken away from her. Beatriz never stopped her from leaving the premises, but Sofia knew that she couldn't go out. Time and again, when Beatriz and Sofia entered into an argument, the former told the latter that she was free to leave, but it was not so. Beatriz had no intention of doing that, and she kept a check of all her activities. She even drugged her, as she felt that there was a chance that she might do something that didn't align with the plan.
Beatriz was obsessed with the idea of having this baby boy. She was paranoid that something would happen, and she would be able to have him. She was observing that Sofia was becoming more restless than ever. She asked Christina, her family doctor, to perform a C-section before the due time. She knew that there were risks involved, but she was ready to take them. Christina and Beatriz, both lied to Sofia and told her that everything was so perfect that a C-section wouldn't be fatal. But in reality, they weren't sure about it.Beatriz was a control freak, and it is established by the fact that she actually killed Nacho when he came to meet Sofia. Nacho had found out that Sofia hadn't gone to London and was, in fact, in Madrid itself. Nacho reaches Beatriz's office and demands to know Beatriz's address as he wanted to meet her. Beatriz was on the way to the office to meet Nacho, when Nacho reached the house and spoke to Sofia through the intercom. He was trying to call the police, when Beatriz returned and rammed him down with her car.
Sofia knew that Beatriz had killed Nacho.Beatriz couldn't accept the fact that Sofia might want to leave her captivity and maybe not be a part of the arrangement. She was least bothered about the legal implications and was just concerned about having this baby anyhow.
Sofia killed Beatriz because she realized that the woman would probably kill her after she had given birth to the baby. Sofia had reasons to believe that she would do so.
Beatriz was not ready to give up. She wanted the baby and was ready to go to any extent for the same.
Sofia attacks Beatriz and captures her. She finds the contract and the money and is ready to leave. She says if Beatriz comes after her, she will expose the contract and ruin her. But Beatriz gets free and attacks Sofia, which prompts Sofia to stab Beatriz through the stomach.Sofia, after killing Beatriz, escapes from the facility she is trapped in. Her water broke, and it is not clear if she was able to make it to the hospital or not. Nacho had been killed by Beatriz, and Sofia knew that it was highly improbable that she was going to find anybody who could help her in the deserted place."

Vadh,2022,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10233718/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"After their son moves to USA, a middle-class married couple is relentlessly harassed by a loan shark. Shambhunath Mishra, a retired middle school teacher lives with his wife Manju Mishra in the old by-lanes of the city Gwalior. They were satisfied with their mundane middle class life, till their son decides to go for higher studies to USA.—nymphea-saraf Shambhunath Mishra, a retired middle school teacher is living a mundane middle-class life with his wife Manju Mishra in Gwalior. Life takes a complete turn for the Mishra family when a situation gets out of hand and it leads to a killing at the hands of Shambhunath Mishra. Mishra ji has very little time to plan cautiously to turn this into a ""perfect murder"" and leave no trace behind.—themoviedb Shambhunath Mishra (Sanjay Mishra) is an old man who lives with his wife Manju Mishra (Neena Gupta) in a dilapidated house in Gwalior and he is barely able to meet ends with his pension and through tuition to local kids. He has a son who has settled in the US with his family and is least concerned about his parents. Manju wants Shambhunath to ask their son Guddu/Diwakar (Diwakar Kumar) to send money back home, but Shambhunath is not able to do so due to his pride.
They have to travel to an internet parlor to even Skype with Guddu, which is not convenient for them in their old age. Even then Guddu scolds them for calling him at 11 pm at night. Guddu's wife is simply not interested in having relationship with her in-laws. They have not been home in the last 6 yrs. Before Shambhunath can ask for any money, Guddu shuts the call as his daughter is getting cranky.To send his son to the USA Shambhunath took an enormous student loan (of Rs 10 lakhs) from a bank at a floating interest rate and a loan shark Prajapati Pandey (Saurabh Sachdeva) by mortgaging his house to Prajapati (for Rs 15 lakhs). The bank EMIs are automatically deducted from his pension (which are sometimes higher when the interest rates are high) and sometimes he is short in paying his installment to Prajapati. At that time Diwakar had promised to pay off the loans, but now wont even look back at his parents and their misfortune.
Prajapati being a criminal thoroughly exploits Shambhunath. He brings prostitutes over to their house and has sex in their bedroom (leaves his dirty condoms there for them to clean up), eats meat and drinks there.. even though he knows that the Mishra's are vegetarians and don't drink.
Naina is a bubbly school-going kid, the only source of happiness in the lives of the Mishra family whose life is otherwise is tragic. She comes to their home for tuition.
Diwakar sends rs 5000 home after Manju makes a missed call to him. When Shambhunath withdraws Rs 2500 from bank, Prajapati sees him and takes Rs 2000 against his remaining EMI payment.Shakti Singh (Manav Vij) is a corrupt cop who is on the payroll of Prajapati. However, Shakti demands higher bribes for his increased criminal activities. Prajapati is annoyed but has little choice because he is a frontman for local MLA Dada who is handling the criminal operations from behind the scenes. Prajapati does not want the matter to be escalated to Dada and has to quickly think of a way to deal with the cop.He decides to sell Shambhunath's house and threatens to vacate it in 2 days. As he is doing this he preys on Naina who is studying at his home. Shambhunath goes to the police station to file a complaint and finds Prajapati chatting with a visibly annoyed Shakti. After Prajapati leaves, Shambhunath requests Shakti to resolve his issue to which he flatly refuses. Later in the night when Shambhunath is alone at home (Manju was at the temple for 2-3 hrs) Prajapati arrives and assaults him. After he calms down, he tells Shambhunath to fetch Naina for him for an hour. For that he offers to forgo interest for 4 months and Rs 1.5 lakhs reduction from the principal.
This is the breaking point for Shambhunath and in a fit of rage, he stabs the throat of Prajapati with a screwdriver. When Manju returns she is shocked to find the dead Prajapati. Shambhunath calms her down and disposes of the body (he cuts the body into little pieces, packs them into a jute bag, takes public transport outside of the city and dumps the jute bags in an abandoned fort). He later returns to the fort, burns the jute bags, collects the bones, returns to the city and mixes the bones at a wheat flour mill.
Manju out of shock and anger stops speaking with him but she cooperates when Shakti comes for an investigation. Shakti says that Shambhunath's house was the last known location of Prajapati's cell phone.
However, Manju is shattered when Prajapati's distressed wife comes with her daughter and pleads for any information about her husband. Out of guilt Shambhunath goes to the police station and confesses his crime with a detailed description to the constable as Shakti has gone elsewhere, but the constable dismisses it as a plot from a fictional crime magazine.When Shambhunath reveals his motive for killing Prajapati, Manju fully supports and he feels guilt-free. Next day Shakti (whom the constable had told about Shambhu's visit to the police station) asks him to sign a confession of murder, to which he refuses for lack of evidence. Shambhu is called by Dada, who says that he has sold his house to a buyer to recoup the loan amount and gives him 3 days to vacate. Shambhu protests that he paid the loan amount to Prajapati. So, Dada says to produce Prajapati, who is missing, and reclaim his house.
Manju and Shambhu again call Diwakar for Rs 10 lakhs, who says he cannot pay any money since he just bought a house himself in the US. He is quite insulting towards his parents and says that they are simply cooking up new excuses to take more and more money from him. Shambhu cuts the call.Shakti later meets him outside the police station (by that time Shakti had spoken to the rickshaw puller who had taken Shambhu to the bus station with 2 jute bags a few nights ago) and tells him that he would absolve from murder charges if he hands him Prajapati's phone to which Shambhunath again refuses. When he reaches home, he find Prajapati's phone and goes to get a charger for it and checks the content of the Phone.
On returning he sees that Dada is forcibly vacating his house. After a showdown, Dada gives him 3 days to repay his loan. Shambhunath then finally hands over Prajapati's phone to Shakti which has a video of him having affair with Dada's wife. Shambhu confesses the crime and says that he would do this again if anyone looked at a 12 yr old girl in the wrong way, again. Manju also meets Shakti and says that if Shambhu is arrested then she would also like to go to jail. As evidence she offers the murder weapon and Prajapati's blood stained clothes that were hidden in the house.
As a part of the deal, Shakti then arrests Dada on Murder charges of Prajapati with the murder weapon and blood-stained clothes presumably recovered from the premises of Dada.After all this turmoil Shambhunath and Manju handover their house to Naina and her family who is shown to be living in an impoverished house."

Rocketry: The Nambi Effect,2022,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9263550/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Based on the life of Indian Space Research Organization scientist Nambi Narayanan, who was framed for being a spy and arrested in 1994. Though free, he continues to fight for justice against the officials who falsely implicated him. During the present time in a televised interview with actor Shah Rukh Khan (Hindi)/Suriya (Tamil), Nambi walks through the events leading to his rise as an eminent engineer to alleged espionage charges, and physical and mental cruelty against him.Nambi starts with his experiences at the Thumba Equatorial Rocket Launching Station, where he saves A. P. J. Abdul Kalam, one of his team members from a major injury during an experiment. In 1969, he is accepted into Princeton University in the US.Nambi successfully completes his MSE program in chemical rocket propulsion under professor Luigi Crocco who recommends him for the NASA fellowship. However, after a brief stint at NASA with Barry Amaldev, he is offered a generous paycheck and other allowances. He rejects it and returns to India so that he may make use of his talents at ISRO. Subsequently, he also manages to get 400 million pounds of equipment from Scotland for free. However, after the suspicious death of Vikram Sarabhai, he did not have adequate support from ISRO or funds from the Indian government to continue his research.At this point, Nambi strikes a deal with the French who need skilled scientists to help them build their own liquid fuel engine. He then moves to France with his colleagues, hoping to learn from France's advanced technology so that they may recreate it back in India. Unbeknownst to the French, Nambi and his 52 colleagues have learnt French before their journey but pretend to not understand them. After being kept out of their major discussions, Nambi's team tries to find a way to gain access to these meetings and test data. It is then that they discover that the French engine is faulty. Nambi uses this opportunity to gain access to the required data in exchange for fixing the engine. The team then returns to India and start working on building their own engine on liquid fuels. However, due to a lack of resources, it takes 8 more years to complete. They test the engine at the same testing facility in France - it goes above the 135-pressure mark and goes all the way to 180. Successful in his plans, Nambi returns to India after naming the engine VIKAS after Vikram Sarabhai, his mentor.Nambi's focus is now on cryogenic engines which he believes will make India competent to participate in the world satellite market. Knowing ISRO's limitations in terms of time and resources, Nambi decides to purchase these engines from some other country. He strikes a deal with Russia (then USSR) after informing them that he knows about their cryogenic missiles, told to him by his Russian friend in Princeton. He requests 4 of them to be imported to India. After the Russians agree, the Americans find out about this deal and try their best to break it. While USSR is on the brink of collapse, Nambi and his colleagues manage to expedite the transfer process and sneak out a couple of engines from under the Americans' noses with the help of the Russians.Back in India, Nambi is arrested out of the blue while news of his treason spreads like wildfire. He is taken to a guest house in Trivandrum where he is beaten and tortured in an attempt to make him confess to his alleged crimes. He also recognizes that the officials are trying to make him repeat their sentences and that there is a recording device in the room to capture it. However, Nambi holds his ground and denies all charges. It was alleged that Nambi met Mariam, a Maldivian woman, in a hotel in Chennai and after being caught in her trap, he was forced to sell India's rocketry secrets to Pakistan. After being hospitalized due to his injuries, Nambi is met by CBI official P. M. Nair, who thoroughly investigates the matter. Nair brings Mariam and her friend, along with a few others into the room. Mariam and her friend reveal that the Kerala police officer in charge of the investigation, Gopal, tortured and threatened them and made them falsely incriminate Nambi, whom they have never met before. They also apologize to Nambi for ruining his reputation and causing pain to him and his family. Nair also figures out that all the accused in this case were members of ISRO's cryogenic wing, and concludes that it was a huge ploy by some powerful parties to hinder India's progress in the cryogenic sector.Months later, Nambi receives bail and returns to his house to find his family members traumatized by the way they were treated by others. Nambi's wife Meena is in need of psychiatric help and the rest of his family are still shunned by society. Hence, Nambi decides that he has to clear his name so that his family may lead normal lives in the future. Years later, Nambi is proven innocent by the Supreme Court and returns to ISRO, helping his colleagues with the Mangalyaan mission. Nambi is later awarded the Padma Bhushan for his contributions to Indian Space Research.After hearing his story, Shah Rukh Khan (Hindi)/Suriya (Tamil) feels so bad for Nambi, that he apologizes to Nambi on the behalf of the whole nation, as the interview ends. The real Nambi is shown receiving the Padma Bhushan award from the president, Ram Nath Kovind."

This title comes under the genre of historical fiction. This is a story written by Kalki Krishnamurthy about the power struggle during the Chozha rule between ADs 900 and 950. The three main points of the plot are the ruler Sundara Chozhan and his sons Aaditha Karikalan and Arunmozhivarman (who later ruled as Rajaraja Chozhan). The conspiracies and the struggle for power between the main characters and those around them forms the basis of this story.. The Story starts with Aaditha Karikalan, elder brother of Arunmozhi Varman sends two messages to his father Sundhara Chola and younger sister Kundavai through Vaanar clan prince Vandhiyadevan. Ponniyin Selvan: I tells the story how Vandhiyadevan saves Aaditha Karikalan, Arunmozhi Varman and their father Sundhara Chola from Pandya Aabath udhavigal. With hurdles and twists, Is Vandhiyadevan successful in saving all three people belonging to the Royal family?—Laxman The story revolves around Vandiyadevan, a charming, brave and a brilliant young man who sets out to the Chola land to deliver a message to the King and the Princess from the Crown Prince Aditya Karikalan. The story shuttles between Vandiyadevan's travels in Chola country and the young Prince Arulmozhi Varman's travels in Sri Lanka. The narrative deals with attempts by his sister Kundavai to bring back Arulmozhi Varman to establish political peace in a land seemingly getting besot with unrest and signs of civil war, plotted by vassals and petty chieftains.Parantaka Chola was succeeded by his second son Gandaraditya as the first son Rajaditya had died in a battle. At the time of Gandaraditya's death, his son Maduranthaka was a two-year-old child and hence Gandaraditya's brother Arinjaya ascended the throne. After Arinjaya's death, his son Parantaka II (Sundara Chola) was crowned. He had two sons, Aditya Karikalan and daughter Kundavai and the younger son Arulmozhi Varman, the later known Rajaraja.When the story starts, the emperor Sundara Chola is ill and bedridden. Aditya Karikalan is the general of the Northern Command and lived in Kanchi and Arulmozhi Varman (who would be famous later as Raja Raja Chola I) is in Sri Lanka in battle and their sister Kundavai Piratti lived in Chola royal household at Pazhayarai.The story is set in motion, when rumor starts that there is a conspiracy against Sundara Chola and his sons. One person who gets a glimpse of the Pandya conspirators is a warrior the Vandiyathevan at the palace of his friend Kandhanmaaran.It is through Vandiyacevan that we meet most of the characters in the novel such as Arulmozhi Varman, the prince whom all the people loved, and Periya Pazhavetturayar, the chancellor who married Nandhini (the main conspirator), when he was sixty. During his youth, Aditya Karikalan had fallen in love with Nandhini, but she turned vengeful after Aditya Karikalan killed Veerapandiyan (who was probably her lover. It was a confusion which revolves in the story, some says it was her father.) and vowed to destroy the Chola dynasty. We also meet Kundavai Devi, who after hearing the news of the conspiracy sends Vandiyadevan to Sri Lanka to give a message to Arulmozhi Varman to come back immediately.Besides these, there are other characters like Madurantakar (the man whom the conspirators want to crown king), the son of Gandaraditya and Aniruddha Brahmarayar, Sundara Chola's Prime Minister and the man who has eyes and ears everywhere. But the most wonderful character in the book is Brahmarayar's spy Azhwarkadiyan Nambi, a who roams around the country challenging for debates. He collects information for the Prime Minister and is always around Vandiyadevan, rescuing him during trouble.There are some lovely and adorable women too, like Vaanathi, Kodumbalur princess (the woman who becomes Arulmozhi's wife later) who is in love with Arulmozhi; Poonkuzhali, the boat woman who rows the future king to Lanka; Mandakini, the deaf and dumb step mother of the original Madurantakar Chola and the aunt of Poonguzhali. Most memorable among these is Nandhini, whose beauty is said to have the power to influence any man. Manimegalai, the sister of Kandhanmaaran (the Kadamboor prince) who helps Nandini without any knowledge that she herself is the conspirator and also he turns against Vandiyadevan, his best friend.In the meanwhile, with Poonguzhali's help, Vandiyadevan reaches Sri Lanka, meets Arulmozhi Varman, and becomes his close friend. In Lanka, Arulmozhi Varman realizes that his father had spent some time in an island near Lanka and had been with a girl born deaf and dumb. He meets her and realizes from her drawing that she and his father have had two children. Who are those children and do they have the right to the throne? Later one day in Thirupurambayam forest Vandiyadevan sees Nandhini and the Pandya conspirators place a small boy on a throne and take a vow in front of him.

She was on leave for three weeks for some unknown reason. We come to know that the school is located in the front portion of the property owned by Rohit Mirchandani, Naina's fiance. Rohit also lives on the same property. The parents come to drop off their kids, and Naina requests one of the parents to send a cake, as she remembered that it was their daughter, Niharika's, birthday the next day. She asked if their driver could deliver the cake to the school. Everybody leaves the premises, and something snaps inside Naina. There is a devilish fervor inside her that is ready to burn anything and everything that comes her way. She calls the Colaba police station and informs them that she has 16 children as hostages.Just then, Niharika's driver arrives with a cake. Savitri, the helper, also, unfortunately, returns to take her phone, which she had forgotten. Both of them are taken into captivity as Naina has no other option. The police officials came to see if the call received was a prank or if there was actually something happening. Naina fires a shot to let the authorities know that she means business. Catherine Alvarez, the ACP, gets in touch with her, and Naina keeps an unusual demand that she would only negotiate with an officer named Javed Khan.Naina initiates her death game, and Javed Khan is brought to the scene. She tells Javed that she would free one kid for every demand met. The first demand she makes is that she wants five crore rupees transferred into her account. Catherine Alvarez and Javed Khan had a history together, due to which they were not very compatible while working together. Catherine does not listen to Javed and tries to send a force inside. It results in Naina killing one of the kids, named Aakash. The commissioner of police gives the complete charge to Javed and sends Catherine to do the background research as both of them had major disagreements that were not benefiting the current situation.Naina's second demand is that she wants to talk to the Prime Minister. Unable to find a solution, the forces give in to the demand. The Prime Minister, Maya Rajguru, talks to Naina on the phone, and the latter urges her to come in person and meet her. Naina tells Javed Khan to find two guys, Rakesh Mathur and Charan Kumar, who she last knew were working at BWC school in Goregaon, and bring them to her. The police are able to locate Rakesh Mathur, but they cannot find Charan Kumar. No one knows what Naina is up to, and Javed Khan and his team have no choice but to agree to what she says because the children are still in her custody.Catherine discovers, while conducting a background check, that Naina has been taking antidepressants and visiting psychologist since she was 16 years old. She searches Naina's house and finds receipts for the medicine prescribed by doctor Juneja. She gets in touch with Dr. Juneja, while Javed Khan gets hold of Naina's mother. The information that they get from both of them makes the picture a bit clearer. Naina had been raped when she was 16 years old. Javed Khan and Catherine were the officers in charge of the case. They both did not pay attention to Naina's case as they were chasing this high-profile case to get into the limelight. Naina's mother begged them for a couple of years and then started living with the trauma as there was no one who would address her grievances.Prime Minister Maya Rajguru decides to meet Naina in person. She is accompanied only by Javed Khan. Naina brings up the POCSO Act, which came into effect in the year 2012. It was enacted in order to protect children under 18 years of age against sexual offenses. Naina asks the Prime Minister why there isn't anything for people over 18. She demands that the Prime Minister assure her right then and there that rape offenders will face the death penalty. The PM tells Naina that amending the rules or passing an act is a complex task that requires time, but also assures her that she will make sure that her rapists are found and put behind bars. That is when Naina reveals the final information that shocks both the people present in the room and those watching it live on social media.For some reason, the police were not able to find Charan Kumar. Charan Kumar was the same person who had brought Niharika's birthday cake and was working as a driver for the family. It was an accident that Charan Kumar landed with the cake. Naina had asked Niharika's mother to send her driver with the cake, as she had figured three weeks back that Charan Kumar was working for them. He was the one who had raped her while Rakesh Mathur held her hands. Naina shoots Charan Kumar and takes her revenge.The commandos enter the house and take Naina into custody. While Naina is being transported to prison, Maya Rajguru brings up the issue of capital punishment in parliament."

Soon, he feels a strong attraction by her.—thetvdb Mu-Gwang is a soldier tasked with the kitchen duty for the division commander's household that is based in the division headquarters' ground. His major goal in life is to win the recognition of his superiors so that he can be promoted to the rank of officer. He is totally dedicated to serving the commander's household when, during the commander's special assignment away from home for one month, the commander's young wife begins to make demands on Mu-Gwang which can only be interpreted as sexual advances. Mu-Gwang is caught between his devotion to his duty and the fear of violating what is clearly forbidden to him -- the commander's wife. Su-Ryeon, the commander's young wife, demands to be called not as ""Ma'am,"" but as ""sister"" by Mu-Gwang, citing the small age difference between them. She further demands that Mu-Gwang's duty to serve the people includes the duty to meet her erotic needs. Already married with a child, Mu-Gwang can't decide if he must obey her demand, and if he does, how it will change their relationship and what will happen to him if her husband, the intimidating division commander many years older than his wife, ever finds out. Su-Ryeon claims that her husband, though a valiant military hero, is not a man to her. It turns out, after they make love for the first time, that she was a virgin. Mu-Gwang's initial reason for acceding to the woman's demand is his hope that she would pull her strings to grant him the promotion that he earnestly wants. But as their relationship develops, he develops powerful affections for her. Before they know it, one month passes by and the feared commander, the man of the house, is due to come home. Once he returns, this relationship must end. What will happen afterward? The film jumps forward 15 years and tells what has happened to all the major characters of the story -- with a surprise ending."

The Soccer Football Movie,2022,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt22774688/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Four young soccer superfans team up to help their idols regain their abilities after a scheming evil scientist steals their talent. The film begins with exciting footage during a football match where Zlatan Ibrahimovic (Himself) scores a goal, just as expected from him. The crowd cheers for him with enthusiasm and the commentator Rob Stone (Himself) joins them in their support for this brilliant player. Not just is Zlatan loved but also considered a front-runner for the award - All-Star Cup All-Star of All-Stars of All Time, at the end of the tournament. While he jumps around with joy and energy, 'Weird Al' Yankovic (himself) (who happens to be at the stadium for some reason) tells Rob that he is also hoping to win this prestigious cup.After interviewing these two celebrities, Rob sees a tall man with a child's face and asks for his opinion. The man walks in the other direction, and we see the kids standing on one other's shoulders to look like an adult. Two boys (O'Dang (Kieran Walton) & Palio (Arnie Pantoja)) and two girls (Nautai (Tania Gunadi) & Zana (Madison Zamor)) fall and start walking toward the players' lounge. Inside, they find Zlatan and cannot believe that they are seeing him in person. Zana impresses him with her goalkeeping skills, whereas Nautai impresses him with her juggling expertise. Afterward, they introduce themselves as Creature Catchers - a group that specializes in pest control services.The group of 4 wanted tickets to watch football, and Zlatan offers to give them these tickets - after also hearing their stories. The tickets are in exchange for a promise that the team will have his back in case he needs a creature caught. He goes inside to freshen up and finds a football inside a gift box. When he peeps into the box and holds this ball, it suddenly opens up to show a fluorescent green-tinted layer inside. A ghastly, little slug walks out and starts screeching. The kids hear this screech and one of the boys runs inside to see if everything is fine. He sees Zlatan getting infected by this creature and turning into a green mutant. The slug bites Zlatan's ponytail to turn him into a vile creature and then once he gets infected, he runs away, breaking the wall.Since the kids witness it in person, they decide to find Zlatan and save him. They don their creature catching outfits. On their way, they meet Megan Rapinoe (Megan Rapinoe). Since Nautai is a huge fan of hers, she is constantly looking to get a selfie with this celebrity. While the monster version of Zlatan jumps around in the city creating havoc, Megan also gets bitten by a slug and turns into a mutant. Meanwhile, Weird Al Yankovic, who is a famous doctor in this city, becomes a mayor with huge public support. While that happens, Zlatan's ponytail becomes a talking creature in itself and starts swaying him towards doing some evil tasks.The kids follow Megan and try to capture her using conventional means. They finally manage to help Megan escape the slug's mutant spell with a whoopee cushion (The sonic quality of the whoopee triggers the mutation), that Nautai was carrying around her all the time. The use of the whoopee cushion both activates and deactivates the slug's mutant spell. They consider it as a solution to find the bite of the slugs. Megan tells them about the all star game. 2 kids go with Megan to ensure that the game proceeds and 2 go to find and bring Zlatan to the game.
While Zlatan decides to get to the bottom of Al's sudden rise to success, he realizes that it is Al's plan to sabotage his success at the All-Stars tournament. Al wants the prestigious cup for himself. The slug sucked up all of Zlatan's talent into his pony tail. After this, he also plans to do the same with more stars.After some time, Al reverses Zlatan's mutation while cutting off his signature ponytail. While locked in chains, he cries for the loss of this feature. He feels that he has lost all power as a result of this and wants to get hold of the ponytail back. However, Al manages to get it himself and attaches it to his hair. He turns into a powerful mutant himself, who is more skilled in football than the likes of Zlatan. Meanwhile, in the players' dressing room, the kids and Megan try to see if any one of them is a mutant. They try using the whoopee cushion, which does not work with one player, who turns out to be a mutant.While the lack of skills disheartens Zlatan after losing his ponytail, the kids help him get his confidence back and train him to play just as effectively as he did before. All of them run back to the stadium to play in the All-Stars tournament so that Zlatan can get the All-Star Cup All-Star of All-Stars of All Time, as he wished to have, and was considered to be deserving of. Megan, Zlatan and all the kids decide to play as a single team and run to the stadium with a winning spirit. Al stands on the opposite side, with a determination to win.Slug mutants (with the stolen talent) play from Al's side, and while his team keeps scoring one goal after the other, Zlatan's team struggles to keep up. However, they learn some tricks to overcome their limitations and start scoring goals as well. Over time, the stadium starts cheering for Zlatan like before and Al loses faith in himself. The ponytail then decides to leave his body, thinking that he does not deserve to have this talent. It also deflates him as if he is an inflatable object.Since the mutant ponytail is determined to get all the talent possible, it turns itself into a giant creature that looks somewhat like a giant mouth with an eye in the middle. While it eats all the slugs, Weird Al gets inflated back into his regular form and everyone seeks vengeance against the giant ponytail creature, together. In the end, they all win over this evil and start playing football on their own, outside the tournament. However, the fear of the slugs persists, who might unexpectedly return anytime in their lives to create havoc."

Gehraiyaan,2022,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10733228/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Takes you on a journey into the deep rooted intricacies of modern human relationships. Alisha (Deepika Padukone), a yoga instructor, believes that her personal and professional lives are in shambles. She's having trouble finding an investor for her fitness software, and her six-year relationship with Karan, a struggling writer, has reached a stalemate.
Just when she thinks she's had enough of her boring life, her filthy rich cousin (Ananya Panday) and her hot-shot fiancee Zain show up (Siddhant Chaturvedi). Within a short period of time, Alisha and Zain become oddly attracted to each other and embark on a passionate love affair, keeping their respective partners in the dark. During their romantic encounters and passionate love-making sessions, the two bond over their traumatic past, blissfully unaware of the impending storm.
An early moment in Gehraiyaan, which lasts only a few seconds, embodies the film's entire core. Alisha (Deepika Padukone), the film's protagonist, is viewing an old home movie. It's a scenario from a family vacation, and she recognizes something: her pre-teen self trying to put on a sweater, which gets trapped around her neck and covers her head. Alisha can't see or breathe, and she says she's ""suffocating"" to her mother. That sense of being trapped and suffocated, which dates back to her youth, has followed her throughout her life.
Her mother used to describe the same sensation; when the anguish grew overwhelming, she hung herself from the ceiling fan (further suffocated herself). Alisha, like many other children of unhappy parents, fears that she, too, would become like them, that she, too, will be unable to escape their past. It's even more difficult for her because she is constantly reminded of her history. She had known Karan (Dhairya Karwa) and Tia while growing up in Mumbai for a few years (Ananya Pandey). For the past six years, Karan, a former ad writer currently working on a book (noob move), has been dating and living with Alisha. He is oblivious and inattentive because he is engrossed in his own world. Alisha, a yoga instructor, has been having trouble raising money for her mobile app. She avoids her father since she holds him responsible for her mother's death. She feels ""suffocated"" since the sweater has adhered to her again.
However, she rekindles her friendship with Tia, and the childhood trio takes a break. There's a new member this time: her fiancee, Zain (Siddhant Chaturvedi). After some time, Alisha realizes that Zain, who has his own scars from the past, isn't all that different from her. He, like Alisha, was unable to save his mother. He isn't from a well-adjusted family, unlike Tia and Karan, and he isn't 'normal.' Zain is a warm blazing bulb in a sea of flickering and chilly tube lights: someone who has been there, someone who understands. They converse, drink, and tell stories. They flirt, joke, and hook up. The sweater is finally loosening up. Alisha can finally take a breath.
This wonderful mix of awareness and perplexity makes perfect sense, because it highlights the film's most striking layer: Alisha is living a lie because she is intent on finding and moulding her story. The climax was surprising because we saw Zain, who Alisha had come to see as her anchor, change into someone who wanted to kill her because she had become an obstacle in his life. When Alisha discovers Zain's texts and notices him slipping tablets to her drink, she understands he's been lying to her yet again. In the ensuing brawl, Zain takes a knock to the head and falls off the yacht, killing himself. That's when Alisha returns to the mainland on her own.
""Gehraiyaan"" gets it right when it comes to how trauma may be passed down through generations and how, without correct guidance, we end up repeating the mistakes we are trying to avoid. Alisha began the affair to get out of a dead-end relationship in which she was trapped because she didn't want to be like her mother. However, when the truth was revealed, she realized she had made the same errors. She decides to accept her past and move on from it rather than resisting it in a very vulnerable chat with her father. This reminds us of something we've heard before: you can't get rid of your luggage; you can only learn to carry it in such a way that it doesn't seem as heavy over time.
Another part of the conclusion is if Zain was aware of Alisha and Tia's reality and if this knowledge influenced any of his actions. We can only assume that even if he was aware, he did nothing about it because the entire property was obviously in Tia's name. The real kicker, though, comes in the final few seconds of the film. As Alisha makes the decision to put the past behind her, a phantom of it appears in front of her. The old woman who confronted Alisha in the end was someone Alisha and Zain had aided during one of their rendezvous on the yacht while they were still together.
At the engagement party, Alisha runs into the old woman, who recognizes her and addresses her by her name. ""Gehraiyaan"" comes to an end here, and it's up to the audience to figure out what transpired. Is Alisha manage to redirect the topic and resolve it in time, or does the old woman explain to Tia how she knows Alisha and Zain? Is everything Alisha tries to put behind her about to resurface and cling to her even more tightly than before? Is it a hint that you'll never completely be able to let go of your past-messy relics will always find their way back into your life? That's the one part where we welcome the viewer's imagination being used."
