Kramer vs. Kramer,1979,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0079417/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"After his wife leaves him, a work-obsessed Manhattan advertising executive is forced to learn long-neglected parenting skills, but a heated custody battle over the couple's young son deepens the wounds left by the separation. Ted Kramer is a career man for whom his work comes before his family. His wife Joanna cannot take this anymore, so she decides to leave him. Ted is now faced with the tasks of housekeeping and taking care of himself and their young son Billy. When he has learned to adjust his life to these new responsibilities, Joanna resurfaces and wants Billy back. Ted, however, refuses to give him up, so they go to court to fight for the custody of their son.—Leon Wolters <wolters@strw.LeidenUniv.nl> Up and coming New York advertising executive Ted Kramer believes that his role and responsibility to his family is to be the household breadwinner, which means a focus on career. Joanna Kramer, his wife of eight years, is relegated to role of housewife and mother to their five and a half year old son, Billy Kramer, as Ted doesn't want her to work outside the house. As such, Joanna, on the encouragement of Margaret Phelps, a recent divorcée in their apartment building and one of Joanna's primary confidantes, decides to abandon the marriage, and leave Billy with Ted, as she feels she can't properly take care of Billy in her current fragile mental state. Ted believes that Joanna is solely going through a phase, and that she will return home in a day or two, which she doesn't. So, Ted has to make some major adjustments in his life. Beyond the time of fitting in Joanna's duties into his work schedule, Ted is ill equipped to take care of the household chores and be Billy's sole caregiver, which is made more difficult as Billy has his own ill feelings about the entire situation. Ted and Billy go through a difficult period in learning how to deal with each other as father and son, but the relationship eventually blossoms into a truly loving one, with Margaret being one of their biggest supporters. Two issues threaten Ted and Billy's new-found familial happiness: the negative effect his new time priority with Billy has on maintaining a productive work life, and the arrival fifteen months later of a newly confidant Joanna, who wants custody of her son.—Huggo On the same day Manhattan advertising executive Ted Kramer lands the biggest account of his career, he learns that his wife, Joanna, is leaving him and their young son, Billy. Forced to raise his son alone, Ted loses his job but gains a stronger relationship with the child with the help of another single parent, Margaret. When Joanna returns to claim custody of Billy, the ensuing court battle takes a toll on everyone concerned.—Jwelch5742 Out of the blue, after eight years, the workaholic, up-and-coming advertising executive, Ted Kramer, finds himself with his back to the wall when his emotionally fatigued wife, Joanna, announces that she wants out of the marriage. As a result, left all alone to care for their innocent six-year-old son, Billy, Ted must reinvent the father-and-son relationship, and make up for lost time. Suddenly, being a single parent becomes a daunting task, and as if that weren't enough, after eighteen long and challenging months, Joanna re-enters Ted's life, bent on claiming custody of her little boy. But, Ted will never let go of his son. Can there be any winners when a family is in ruins?—Nick Riganas Ted Kramer (Dustin Hoffman) is a workaholic advertising executive who has just been assigned a new and very important account (& named as the creative director of the agency). Ted arrives home and shares the good news with his wife Joanna (Meryl Streep) only to find that she is leaving him and their son Billy (Justin Henry). She takes $2000 from their savings account as that's what she had when they first got married. Ted tries to stop her but Joanna is determined to leave.
Ted and Billy initially resent one another as Ted no longer has time to carry his increased workload, and Billy misses his mother's love and attention. Ted doesn't know the house schedules, like Billy's school times, meals etc etc. He burns his hands and is hyper the first time he cooks breakfast for Billy and gets him ready for school.At work, Ted's boss Jim O'Connor (George Coe) is sympathetic but wants Ted to focus on the new airlines account 24*7. Ted assures that he is on top of his work. Ted blows his lid when Billy spills juice all over his work at home. They go grocery shopping together. Ted takes down all photos of him and Joanna together (he later allows one photo in Billy's room). Billy gets upset when Ted is late picking him up from a birthday party.
After months of unrest, Ted and Billy learn to cope, and gradually bond as father and son. Ted disciplines Billy by putting a clamp on the number of hrs of TV viewing and eating proper food. He wont put up with Billy's tantrums.
Ted is frequently late for important meetings at work an his clients are upset. Jim tells Ted that he is getting very nervous as its been 8 months now and the situation seems to be getting worse, rather than better. Ted attends all of Billy's functions in school, including his performances. he has sex with a co-worker Phyllis Bernard (JoBeth Williams) from office.Ted befriends his neighbor Margaret (Jane Alexander), who had initially counseled Joanna to leave Ted if she was that unhappy. Margaret is a fellow single parent, and she and Ted become kindred spirits. Margaret doesn't intend to get married again. One day, as the two sit in the park watching their children play, Billy accidentally falls off the jungle gym, severely cutting his face. Ted sprints several blocks through oncoming traffic carrying Billy to the hospital, where he comforts his son during treatment (10 stitches).Fifteen months after she walked out, Joanna returns to New York from California to claim Billy, and a custody battle ensues. The lawyer John Shaunessy (Howard Duff) charges Ted $15K, and more on appeal. Ted is removed by Jim from the airlines account and fires him from his job. Shaunessy asks Ted to get any job before the hearing as it wont look good in court if Ted has no job. He gets a job of a junior copywriter that pays $5K less.
During the custody hearing, both Ted and Joanna are unprepared for the brutal character assassinations that their lawyers unleash on the other. Ted didn't allow Joanna to work during their marriage. Her self esteem was shot to pieces and it took time for her to realize that there was nothing wrong with her.
Shaunessy attacks Joanna on her sexual history, including the fact that she has a lover now. He also brands Joanna as flighty and a failure at all things she attempted.
Margaret is forced to testify that she had advised an unhappy Joanna to leave Ted, though she also attempts to tell Joanna on the stand that her husband has profoundly changed. Eventually, the damaging facts that Ted was fired because of his conflicting parental responsibilities which forced him to take a lower-paying job come out in court, as do the details of Billy's accident.
His original salary was noted as ""$33,000 a year"", whereas he was forced to admit that his new salary was only ""$28,200"", after Joanna has told the court that her ""present salary"" as a sportswear designer is ""$31,000 a year"".The court awards custody to Joanna, a decision mostly based on the tender years doctrine. Devastated with the decision, Ted discusses appealing the case, but his lawyer warns that an appeal would be too expensive and Billy himself would have to take the stand in the resulting trial. Ted cannot bear the thought of submitting his child to such an ordeal, and decides not to contest custody.On the morning that Billy is to move in with Joanna, Ted and Billy make breakfast together, mirroring the meal that Ted tried to cook the first morning after Joanna left. They share a tender hug, knowing that this is their last daily breakfast together. Joanna calls on the intercom, asking Ted to come down to the lobby alone. When he arrives she tells Ted how much she loves and wants Billy, but she knows that his true home is with Ted, and therefore will not take custody of him.
She asks Ted if she can go up and see Billy, and Ted says that would be fine. As they are about to enter the elevator together, Ted tells Joanna that he will stay downstairs to allow Joanna to see Billy in private. After she enters the elevator, Joanna wipes tears from her face and asks her former husband ""How do I look?"" As the elevator doors start to close on Joanna, Ted answers, ""Terrific."""
The Amityville Horror,1979,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078767/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Newlyweds and their three children move into a large house where a mass murder was committed. They start to experience strange, inexplicable manifestations which have strong effects on everyone living in or visiting the house. Based on a true story that was claimed by writer Jay Anson, The Amityville Horror is about a large house on the coast of Long Island where newlyweds George and Kathy Lutz and their three children move into the house that they hope will be their dream house which ends up in terror. Despite full disclosure by the real estate agent of the house's history, George and Kathy buy the house. George says, ""Houses don't have memories,"" but they turn to their family priest Father Delaney who believes the house is haunted and performs an exorcism on the house. But satanic forces in the house causes him to become blind and makes him very sick. With the help of another priest Father Bolen and a police detective, George and Kathy face the fears of the house, but not knowing the forces are planning to possess George and then the children.—<Blythe379@cs.com> With total disregard for the horrific rumours about the grislyRonald DeFeomurders, George and Kathy Lutz, along with their three children, move into a dirt-cheap colonial house at 112 Ocean Avenue, Amityville, New York. However, the Lutzes' attempt to start a peaceful new life quickly turns into a nightmare as sudden, inexplicable occurrences and disturbing incidents erode the family's personalities. Now, a mysteriously sullen George is obsessed with sharpening his axe, and local priest Father Delaney realises Satanic forces are at work. Can they escape the diabolical horror of Amityville?—Nick Riganas ""The Amityville Horror"" (Released July 1979) is based on the true story of George Lee Lutz (James Brolin, of ""Marcus Welby, MD"") and Kathy Lutz (Margot Kidder, fresh from the success of ""Superman"") who bought a charming Dutch Colonial home in Amityville, on the coast of Long Island NY, in 1975. A sign in front of the house gives its name as ""High Hopes.""The film is based on the book of the same title, by Jay Anson, published in 1977. (Anson did not work extensively with the couple, but worked from hours of taped conversations between George and Kathy, which they had turned over to him.)The home features the Dutch gambrel (barn-shaped) roof design, and a pair of quarter-circle windows, on the end, on the 3rd floor, up near the roof. These are illuminated to look like the home's eyes. Filmmakers modified a house in New Jersey to look like the actual home in Amityville, and it is surprisingly close.It is a documented fact that a troubled young man, 28, had shot his entire family to death in the house, on 11/13/1974, including father, mother, two brothers and two sisters. Thus, in the film, the history of the house allows the Lutz's, in the fall of 1975, to make an offer of $80,000 on the home, which, we are told, is easily worth $120,000.Despite full disclosure of the home's past, by the realtor, the couple proceeds with the purchase, and moves in. George appears not to be strong of faith, but Kathy is at least a nominal Catholic. The couple turns to Father Delaney to bless the home. Father Delaney (Rod Steiger) encounters troubles in trying to bless the home, including a room full of flies, out of season, violent stomach sickness, and later, blisters on his palm when trying to make even a phone contact with Kathy at the home.In his further efforts to confront the evil, he suffers a car wreck from brake and steering malfunction, a lack of support by his superiors in the diocese as he describes the occult things he's seen, and ultimately, blindness and a mental breakdown.It is most moving when he, at the altar of the church, is praying, ""Give them strength of mind and body, that they may do Your will,"" and a high-mounted statue begins to crumble and drop dust down in the chancel area. Refusing to run, he continues the prayer at a scream, ""Oh, Lord, give them strength of mind and body, that they may do Your will!"" weeping at the seeming triumph of evil over good. After this, we are shown Father Delaney, sitting in an outdoor garden area, in a totally unresponsive state. Presubably, his mind is gone.George begins to be more sullen and angry over perceived cold in the house, and obsesses with splitting logs and keeping the fireplace stoked. One of the two boys suffers a crushed hand when a sash window falls on it, and the little girl has an imaginary friend, Jody, who seems to be of a malevolent nature. Mom, Kathy, catches a glimpse of two red, swine-like eyes, outside the daughter's 2nd story window. The family dog, Harry, a black labrador, obsesses over a secret room in the basement.George's land surveying business begins to suffer with his lack of attendance, and his partner is concerned. The business partner's wife, very sensitive to the paranormal, is at once both revulsed and intrigued by the things she feels when at the house. ""Boy are these vibes ever strong!"" she says at one point.The Lutz's witness a black, bubbling substance coming up in the toilets, an ""ooze"" coming down from nail holes in the walls, a babysitter being trapped in a closet despite its not having a locking doorknob, the disappearance of $1,500.00 cash, and Kathy's Aunt, a nun, running from the house and vomiting. Kathy observes George's persistant waking at 3:15 am, feeling he must go check on the boathouse, and other unsettling incidents. Kathy has nightmares in which she is given details about the killings of the home's prior family.Their research at the library and at the county records office suggest that the house is built atop a tribal burial ground, and that a known devil worshiper named Ketcham had once lived on the land.Finally, the paranormal events drive the family to flee the house one night, in the pouring rain, no longer even worried about their posessions. The final titles tell us that, ""Today the Lutz's live in another state."""
Apocalypse Now,1979,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078788/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A U.S. Army officer serving in Vietnam is tasked with assassinating a renegade Special Forces Colonel who sees himself as a god. It is the height of the war in Vietnam, and U.S. Army Captain Willard is sent by Colonel Lucas and a General to carry out a mission that, officially, 'does not exist - nor will it ever exist'. The mission: To seek out a mysterious Green Beret Colonel, Walter Kurtz, whose army has crossed the border into Cambodia and is conducting hit-and-run missions against the Viet Cong and NVA. The army believes Kurtz has gone completely insane and Willard's job is to eliminate him. Willard, sent up the Nung River on a U.S. Navy patrol boat, discovers that his target is one of the most decorated officers in the U.S. Army. His crew meets up with surfer-type Lt-Colonel Kilgore, head of a U.S Army helicopter cavalry group which eliminates a Viet Cong outpost to provide an entry point into the Nung River. After some hair-raising encounters, in which some of his crew are killed, Willard, Lance and Chef reach Colonel Kurtz's outpost, beyond the Do Lung Bridge. Now, after becoming prisoners of Kurtz, will Willard & the others be able to fulfill their mission?—Derek O'Cain In 1969, at the height of the Vietnam War, Captain Benjamin Willard is resting in his hotel room, waiting for a mission to be given to him by the United States Army. A mission that no one else has ever been given before. The mission is to travel upriver to assassinate a colonel, who's gone AWOL and acts like a demi-god to a group of tribal natives in the jungle. Taking the mission for what it is, Willard travels upriver along with a ragtag group of American soldiers, some of which are called by their nicknames. Along the way, several obstacles get in their way of the mission including a deadly encounter with a tiger and heavy enemy fire at a strategic bridge. As Willard nears the end of his mission, he soon finds himself reeling in the horrors and sanity of war itself as he confronts the colonel face to face in which Willard's true nature begins to emerge slowly.—blazesnakes9 The worn out and fatigued U.S Army captain Benjamin L. Willard is sent on a harrowing and surreal mission into the deepest parts of the jungle during the height of the Vietnam War, with the objective of eliminating the rogue Walter E. Kurtz, a Green Beret officer who has completely lost his sanity. Together with a small squad of soldiers, Willard sets out by boat to travel upriver towards Kurtz' base. But Willard soon eerily realizes that the closer he gets to his target, the more he seems himself in him. Everything could happen on the mission, but one thing is clear; if successful, Willard will not return the same.—goddangwatir At the height of the Vietnam war, experienced soldier and covert operative Captain Benjamin Willard withdraws from a drunken and disheveled state to accept his most daring and secretive mission yet. His objective is to travel down the Nyung river by boat and assassinate a Green Beret Colonel named Kurtz who has gone insane deep within the Jungle, and leads his men and a local tribe as a god on illegal guerrilla missions into enemy territory. As Willard and the crew of a Navy PR boat unaware of his objective embark on their journey from the security of civilization into the untamed depths of the jungle, Willard confronts not only the same horrors and hypocrisy that pushed the level headed Colonel Kurtz over the edge into an abyss of insanity, but the primal violence of human nature and the darkness of his own heart.—redcommander27 The story opens in Saigon, South Vietnam late in 1969. U.S. Army Captain and special operations veteran Benjamin L. Willard (Martin Sheen), has returned to Saigon on another combat tour during the Vietnam War, casually admitting that he is unable to rejoin society in the USA and that his marriage has broken up. He drinks heavily, chain-smokes and hallucinates alone in his room, becoming very upset and injuring himself when he breaks a large mirror.One day two military policemen arrive at Willard's Saigon apartment and after cleaning him up, escort him to an officers trailer where military intelligence officers Lt. General R. Corman (G. D. Spradlin) and Colonel Lucas (Harrison Ford) approach him with a top-secret assignment to follow the Nung River into the remote jungle, find rogue Special Forces Colonel Walter E. Kurtz (Marlon Brando) and ""terminate his command with extreme prejudice"". Kurtz apparently went insane and now commands his own Montagnard troops inside neutral Cambodia. They play a recording of Kurtz' voice, captured by Army intelligence where Kurtz rambles about the destruction of the war and a snail crawling on the edge of a straight razor.Willard is flown by helicopter to Cam Ranh Bay and joins a Navy PBR commanded by ""Chief"" Phillips (Albert Hall) and crewmen Lance (Sam Bottoms), ""Chef"" (Frederic Forrest) and ""Mr. Clean"" (Laurence Fishburne). Willard narrates that the crew are mostly young soldiers; Clean is only 17 and from the South Bronx, Lance is a famous surfer from California and Chef is a chef from New Orleans. The Chief is an experienced sailor who mentions that he'd previously brought another special operations soldier into the jungles of Vietnam on a similar mission and heard that the man committed suicide. As they travel down the coast to the mouth of the Nung River, Willard's voice-over reveals that hearing Kurtz' voice triggered a fascination with Kurtz himself.They rendezvous with reckless Lieutenant Colonel Bill Kilgore (Robert Duvall), a commander of an attack helicopter squadron, the infamous 1st of the 9th Air Cav (Cavalry), who initially scoffs at them. Kilgore befriends Lance, both being keen surfers, and agrees to escort them through the Viet Cong-filled coastal mouth of the Nung River due to the surfing conditions there.The next morning, Kilgore launches a brutal helicopter assault on the Viet Cong village amid air and napalm strikes on the locals and 'Ride of the Valkyries' playing over the helicopter loudspeakers, the beach is taken and Kilgore orders others to surf it amid enemy artillery fire. Kilgore nostalgically regales about a previous strike and reflects disappointed on how the war will end one day. Willard gathers the crew to the PBR, transported via helicopter, and begins the journey upriver.During the long journey that occupies the bulk of the story, Willard sifts further through the Kurtz dossier, learning that he was a model officer and possible future general. Back in 1964 after returning from a tour of duty in South Vietnam, the 38-year-old Kurtz had eschewed the promotion, applying several times for Airborne training that he should've been too old to complete and had sent a report to his superiors about the war that was deemed classified. In other voice-over narration by Willard, Kurtz returned to South Vietnam in 1966 as a member of the Special Forces for another combat tour, which his fighting methods won victories against the enemy Viet Cong and North Vietnamese, but also drew criticism from his superior officers. By the late summer of 1968, Kurtz' combat patrols were coming under frequent ambush which ended in November 1968 after Kurtz ordered his men to summarily execute four high ranking South Vietnamese Intelligence officials who he suspected were double agents for the Viet Cong. Despite the fact that the four executed Vietnamese were indeed revealed to be double agents, the US Army charged Kurtz with murder for taking matters into his own hands instead of going through proper channels which resulted in Kurtz and his Special Forces/South Vietnamese army fleeing into Cambodia.One evening, Willard accompanies Chef into the jungle to pick mangoes when they encounter a tiger. But they both make it back to the boat safely and continue on. Willard sees the tiger encounter and Chef's near-hysterical panic as a stern reminder of the rule to never leave the boat.Another evening or two later, the crew visit a supply depot USO show featuring Playboy Playmates which goes awry when the servicemen attempt to assault the Playmates which the R&R to a quick end.Some time later, the crew inspect a civilian sampan for weapons, but the strung-out Mr. Clean panics and opens fire, prompting Lance to open fire on the innocent Vietnamese family as well. Amid the supplies on the boat, Chef finds a puppy. Lance harshly takes it from Chef and keeps it as a pet. When Chef finds one young woman alive, Willard coldly shoots her to prevent any further delay of his mission. Tension arises between Chief and Willard from this moment on as Willard believes himself to be in command of the PBR, while Chief prioritizes other objectives over Willard's secret mission.Another night later, the crew reaches the chaos of the Do Lung bridge, under attack by enemy forces.Willard also sees the lost side of the war: burned-out, stoned soldiers fighting a battle they are losing to keep the bridge open. As the PBR crew leave, the bridge is once again destroyed by enemy shellfire. As the boat continues up the river, Willard learns from another dossier brought to him by a courier that the missing commanding officer, Captain Colby (Scott Glenn), was sent on an earlier mission to kill Kurtz. He'd sent a scrawled letter back to his family telling his wife to give up any hope of his return. Due to the disturbing nature of the letter, the Army had told his family he was simply missing.Lance and Chef are continually under the influence of drugs. Lance in particular smears his face with camouflage paint and becomes withdrawn. The next day the boat is fired upon by an unseen enemy in the trees, killing Mr. Clean and making Chief even more hostile toward Willard.Another day or two later, the PBR is ambushed again, this time by Montagnard warriors as they cross the border into Cambodia, they return fire despite Willard's objections that the arrows fired on them aren't lethal. Chief is impaled with a spear and tries to kill Willard by trying to pull him onto the spearhead before dying.Afterward, Willard confides in the two surviving crew members, Chef and Lance, about the mission and they reluctantly agree to continue upriver, where they find the banks littered with mutilated bodies. Arriving at Kurtz's outpost at last, Willard takes Lance with him to the village, leaving Chef behind with orders to call an airstrike on the village if they do not return.In the camp, the soldiers are met by an American freelance photographer (Dennis Hopper), who manically praises Kurtz's genius. As they proceed, Willard and Lance see corpses and severed heads scattered about the temple that serves as Kurtz's living quarters and encounter Colby, who seems catatonic. Willard is bound and brought before Kurtz in the darkened temple, where Kurtz derides him as an ""errand boy"". Meanwhile, Chef prepares to call in the airstrike but is kidnapped. Later imprisoned, Willard screams helplessly as Kurtz drops Chef's severed head into his lap.After some time, Willard is released and given the freedom of the compound. In another monologue sequence, the shadowy Kurtz lectures him on his theories of war, humanity and civilization while praising the ruthlessness and dedication of the Viet Cong: Kurtz had reached his breaking point some years before when he'd led a mission to inoculate the children of a small village for polio. Soon after completing that mission, Kurtz' unit was called back by one of the villagers where he found that the Viet Cong had come and hacked off every child's arm that had been injected with the vaccine. Kurtz morbidly admires the vicious dedication of the Viet Cong and the will they had to foil the efforts of his unit to help the villagers. Kurtz believed that if he'd had a large legion of men who would go to such extremes that he could end the war itself. Near the end of their time together, Kurtz discusses his son and asks that Willard tell his son everything about him in the event of his death.That night, as the villagers ceremonially slaughter a water buffalo, Willard enters Kurtz's chamber as Kurtz is making a tape recording, and attacks him with a machete. Lying mortally wounded on the ground, Kurtz whispers his final words ""The horror ... the horror ..."" before dying. Willard discovers substantial typed work of Kurtz's writings (scrawled with ""Drop the bomb Exterminate them all!"") and takes it with him before exiting. Willard descends the stairs from Kurtz's chamber and drops his weapon. The villagers do likewise and allow Willard to take the near catatonic Lance by the hand and lead him to the boat. The two of them ride away in the PBR downstream to find help and safety as the Army tries to reach them on the short-wave radio. Willard turns off the radio. As Willard drives the boat away into the dark of the night jungle and in the pouring rain, the last words of Kurtz's ""the horror... the horror..."" echo in his mind."

The cloud destroys three of the Klingon Empire's new K'I'Inga-class warships and the monitoring station on route. On Earth, the star ship Enterprise is undergoing a major refit; her former commanding officer, James T. Kirk (William Shatner), has been promoted to Admiral and works in San Francisco as Chief of Starfleet Operations. Starfleet dispatches Enterprise to investigate the cloud entity as the ship is the only one in intercept range, requiring her new systems to be tested in transit.Kirk takes command of the ship citing his experience, angering Captain Willard Decker (Stephen Collins), who had been overseeing the refit as its new commanding officer. Testing of Enterprise's new systems goes poorly; two officers, including the science officer, are killed by a malfunctioning transporter, and improperly calibrated engines almost destroy the ship. Kirk's unfamiliarity with the new systems of the Enterprise increases the tension between him and first officer Decker. Commander Spock (Leonard Nimoy) arrives as a replacement science officer, explaining that while on his home world undergoing a ritual to purge all emotion, he felt a consciousness that he believes emanates from the cloud.
Other officers are Leonard McCoy (DeForest Kelley), the chief medical officer. Montgomery Scott (James Doohan), the Enterprise's chief engineer. Pavel Chekov (Walter Koenig), the Enterprise's weapons officer. Uhura (Nichelle Nichols), the communications officer. Hikaru Sulu (George Takei), the Enterprise's helmsmanEnterprise intercepts the energy cloud and is attacked by an alien vessel within. But this time, Spock is able to discern that the alien vessel has been trying to communicate with the Enterprise. Spock fixes the Linguacode and transmission frequencies of their reception and the attacks on the Enterprise stop.
A probe appears on the bridge, attacks Spock and abducts the navigator, Ilia (Persis Khambatta). She is replaced by a robotic replica, another probe sent by ""V'Ger"" to study the crew. Decker is distraught over the loss of Ilia, with whom he had a romantic history. He becomes troubled as he attempts to extract information from the doppelganger, which has Ilia's memories and feelings buried within. Spock takes a spacewalk to the alien vessel's interior and attempts a telepathic mind meld with it. In doing so, he learns that the vessel is V'Ger itself, a living machine.Shortly thereafter V'Ger transmit a signal in simple binary code on radio and asks for the creator. When it receives no response, it fires probes into the atmosphere that Enterprise calculates will rid the planet of mankind. Ilia the robot tells Kirk that V'Ger has calculated that the Carbon lifeforms infest the creator's planet as it infests the Enterprise and hence needs to be eliminated to stop interfering with the creator's work.
Spock suggests that V'Ger is a child and asks Kirk to treat it as such. Kirk tells Ilia the robot why the creator has not responded but won't reveal that to V'Ger. V'Ger has a huge power surge (in the manner of throwing a tantrum). Kirk holds and says to Ilia robot that he will only reveal the information to V'Ger directly. As such, the Enterprise is pulled towards the V'Ger's central brain complex.At the center of the massive ship, V'Ger is revealed to be Voyager 6, a 20th-century Earth space probe believed lost. The damaged probe was found by an alien race of living machines that interpreted its programming as instructions to learn all that can be learned and return that information to its creator. The machines upgraded the probe to fulfill its mission, and on its journey the probe gathered so much knowledge that it achieved consciousness. Spock realizes that V'Ger lacks the ability to give itself a focus other than its original mission; having learned what it could on its journey home, it finds its existence empty and without purpose. Before transmitting all its information, V'Ger insists that the Creator come in person to finish the sequence. Realizing that the machine wants to merge with its creator, Decker offers himself to V'Ger; he merges with the Ilia probe and V'Ger, creating a new form of life that disappears into another dimension. With Earth saved, Kirk directs Enterprise out to space for future missions."

Who dares to confront the formidable alien, the unwanted eighth passenger?—Nick Riganas In the distant future, during her return to Earth, the commercial spaceship ""Nostromo"" intercepts a distress call from a distant moon. The seven-member crew is awakened from hypersleep and the spaceship subsequently descends on the moon. While exploring the moon, a three-member team of the crew discovers a derelict spaceship and a huge chamber inside her that contains thousands of eggs. When a curious team member goes near one of the eggs, the parasite inside the egg attacks him, rendering him unconscious. He is brought back aboard and the spaceship takes off. After a little while, the parasite dies and his host wakes up seemingly unruffled. Everything soon returns to normal, but not for long.—Soumitra The opening credits appear in front of a large planet with rings. Out in the far reaches of deep space the Nostromo, a commercial towing space vehicle, carrying a refinery with twenty million tons of mineral ore, is en route to Earth with a crew of seven. Inside, the ship appears eerily quiet, but suddenly, the on-board computer is activated. Lights inside the ship are activated, and a room with seven biobeds is illuminated. The canopies open to awaken the crew. Executive Officer Kane (John Hurt) is the first to awaken from hypersleep. They congregate in the mess hall, where they cheerfully enjoy a meal. Chief Engineer Parker (Yaphet Kotto) and Engineering Technician Brett (Harry Dean Stanton) take the opportunity to discuss the bonus system, which they find unfair, as they get paid less than the officers. Captain Dallas (Tom Skerritt) is called away by MOTHER, the ship's computer, before they can have a meaningful conversation. Dallas enters the MOTHER console room, and tries to assess the situation, as the rest of the crew gets in the cockpit of the ship to determine their location. They quickly deduce that they are nowhere near home yet. Navigator Lambert (Veronica Cartwright) finds out that they are at Zeta II Reticuli, an outlying system. When Parker and Brett return from their round of the lower deck, complaining about their colleagues' attitude and the bonus system, Dallas briefs the crew: the ship is not even halfway home, and has altered its course because it has picked up an unknown signal, which repeats every 12 seconds. The crew has been awoken from hypersleep to investigate. Parker protests, arguing that they're not a rescue team and that they should be compensated for the extra work, but Science Officer Ash (Ian Holm) stipulates that per Company contract, the crew is obliged to investigate any signal from an intelligent source; non-compliance will result in loss of pay, which quickly puts Parker in a more cooperative mood.The crew assembles in the cockpit to listen to the signal. It sounds very strange and unearthly, perhaps like a voice. Lambert homes in on it and finds that it comes from a planetoid, 1200 km in diameter, with a two-hour rotation and some gravity.The Nostromo approaches the planet, which is close to one enormous ringed planet and two smaller ones. The ship separates from the refinery, and sets course to the planet's surface. It descends toward the planet, but the landing is rough, causing damage that will take some time for Parker and Brett to repair (although they allot themselves several more hours than their own estimate). The planet is windy, and visibility is low. As the source of the signal is 2000 meters away and the sun is coming up, Dallas and Kane decide to investigate on foot. A reluctant Lambert is ordered to join. Ash takes place behind an outer window with a communication console, as the team puts on their space suits and leave the ship to investigate the signal on the planet's windy surface. In the meanwhile, Warrant Officer Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) has gone to the lower deck to inspect the repairs. Parker and Brett ask if there will be a bonus for any discovery which is made on the surface; Ripley assures them that the law guarantees them a share, before returning upstairs, as they keep teasing her. Outside, the team walks between the rocks, through the planetoid's inhabitable atmosphere. Inside the ship, Ash tells Ripley that MOTHER has not yet deciphered the signal; she volunteers to give it a try. Ripley accesses a console and starts working on the strange signal.Outside, the sun is up and the wind has died down. The team clears the rock formation, and makes a fascinating discovery. Near the horizon, they see a derelict spacecraft of unknown origin. It is lying against the rocks, vaguely shaped like a horseshoe. Despite Lambert's hesitation, they approach it, losing contact with the Nostromo upon entering the massive ship through an opening at the side. Inside, they find hallways with walls textured like bones. At the end is an elevated platform. It carries the remains of an enormous alien creature in a large chair, now fossilized. Upon initial examination, there is evidence of some unknown trauma to its chest: its ribs are bent outward, as if it exploded from the inside. Lambert wants to leave. Kane then draws the others' attention to a large hole in the floor. Meanwhile, analysis of the unidentified transmission suggests that it is not an SOS, but a warning. Ripley wants to go after the search party, but Ash talks her out of it, reasoning that by the time she gets there, the search team will probably know what the signal means.Kane is lowered into the hole by means of a winch. He finds an enormous tube-like chamber down below, divided into sections and basins. He nears one basin, discovering thousands of leathery objects that resemble large eggs. He also discovers a strange light and mist covering the eggs that reacts when broken. He trips and falls into the pit, but is uninjured and moves in to investigate further. Kane touches one of the eggs, which seems to give a shriek. He illuminates the egg from behind with a flashlight and discovers movement inside. He grabs a pistol: a strange, spider-like organism is the resident. The egg has flaps on top which open, revealing its insides. As Kane moves into for a better look, the strange lifeform inside suddenly leaps out, attaching itself to Kane's helmet, melting his faceplate.Ash is looking towards the planet's surface, when he sees Dallas and Lambert carrying the unconscious Kane back to the Nostromo. They enter the airlock and ask Ripley to let them in, while Ash waits at the inner airlock door to open it. They inform Ripley that an organism has attached itself to Kane's face. Ripley hesitates, citing quarantine protocol: for the safety of the crew, Kane should first be decontaminated for 24 hours before being brought on board. Dallas fears for Kane's life and orders her to open the door, but she refuses, despite Dallas trying to pull rank. However, Ash disregards Ripley's decision and lets them in.In the infirmary, Dallas and Ash cut Kane's helmet open: they find that a spider-like creature has attached itself to Kane's face, with eight finger-like legs, and a long tail tightly wrapped around his neck. Despite his mouth being blocked, Kane is breathing normally. Parker, Brett and Lambert observe through a window. Ripley joins them, and is angrily slapped by a furious Lambert for not allowing them to re-enter the ship; the men break the women apart. Dallas berates Ripley for disobeying a direct order, but Ripley furiously replies that she was just following the rules of quarantine protocol. Ash attempts to remove the creature from Kane's face with a pair of forceps, but it merely tightens its grip, and is holding on so tight that it will tear Kane's skin off with it. Kane is examined with a sophisticated medical scanner, which shows that the creature has inserted a tube into Kane's throat and is feeding him oxygen. Ash deduces that since Kane is comatose and the parasite is feeding him oxygen, removing the creature may kill Kane, however Dallas is willing to take the risk.Ash tries to cut off one of its legs with a scalpel, but a yellowish fluid pours out of the wound and begins to eat through the floor. Out of concern that the acidic fluid will breach the hull, the crew runs several floors downstairs, and find that the stuff's corrosive effect is neutralized after burning through several decks. Dallas says the substance resembles molecular acid, and Brett comments the creature must be using it for blood. ""Wonderful defense mechanism - you don't dare kill it"", growls Parker. Dallas orders everyone back to their posts, as Kane is left in his coma to be tended by Ash.Parker and Brett resume their repairs, commenting that they should never have landed on the planet. As Kane's situation remains unchanged, Ash is collecting data on the creature. He is startled by the sudden presence of Ripley in the infirmary. She wants to know what he has found out yet. Ash can only confirm that the creature's skin is made up of polysaccharides, which it is slowly replacing with silicon to toughen its hide against the new environment it finds itself within. Ripley then confronts him with his decision to let it aboard, ignoring the quarantine law; Ash defends himself by stating that he did it out of concern for Kane's life, and that he temporarily forgot the fact that Ripley is the officer in charge when Dallas and Kane are away. Ripley replies that by allowing this breech of protocol, he has put all of their lives at risk, which is not appropriate behavior for a science officer. Ash coldly lets her know that he is perfectly capable to make that decision, and she should stick to her own job. Ripley leaves.Dallas is sitting in the Nostromo's escape shuttle, the Narcissus, listening to music, when he is called to the infirmary by Ash, because something has happened to Kane. The creature has detached from Kane's face on its own, and has disappeared. Dallas, Ripley and Ash search the infirmary, and find it when it suddenly drops from an overhead compartment on Ripley; it appears to be dead, only showing basic reflexes. They take a closer look at it, and confirm it is dead. Ripley wants to get rid of it, fearing that it may become even more harmful when dead; Ash strongly disagrees, given the uniqueness of the specimen. He wants to take it back to Earth for more tests, as it is harmless now. Dallas shares Ripley's sentiment, but leaves the decision to Ash, to Ripley's amazement.Ripley tries to talk some sense into Dallas, who is unwilling to listen to her arguments, replying that he only runs the ship, and Ash has the final word on all things concerning the Company's science division. Ripley asks if Dallas has ever worked with Ash before. Dallas mentions that he did five tours with the same science officer, but this person was suddenly replaced two days before the Nostromo left Thedus dock back on Earth. Ripley admits she doesn't trust Ash, but Dallas responds that he doesn't trust anybody. He asks about the status of repairs, which are still underway, but appear completed enough to leave the planetoid. Even though Ripley does not recommend it, Dallas prefers to leave as soon as possible. After a successful take-off and despite some minor technical errors, the ship docks with the refinery and cargo in orbit. The Nostromo then resumes its course for Earth.The crew is back in the mess hall, bickering again about what to do with Kane. Dallas decides they will all get back into hypersleep. Lambert has calculated that it will take another 10 months to get back to Earth, which spoils their moods even further. Ash suddenly calls Dallas to the infirmary. Kane has awoken, still groggy but seemingly unharmed. He remembers very little of the event, apart from a nightmare about smothering, but is starved and wants to eat. The crew decides to have one last meal before they re-enter hypersleep. During the meal, the crew is finally having a good time again, joking and enjoying the food. Kane is eating like he has not had food in ages, sharply observed by Ash. Suddenly, Kane begins to choke. After initially thinking he has swallowed something bad, the mood suddenly changes when Kane starts to groan and convulse violently. While he lies writhing and screaming on the table, the crew tries to help and stabilize him, but a bloodstain suddenly appears on the front of Kane's shirt. The executive officer then violently thrashes about several times despite the crew's efforts to help him, and with one horrified scream, he goes silent. A small head about the size of a man's fist bursts through the front of Kane's chest. It silently observes its surroundings. Parker moves in to kill it with a knife, but he is stopped by Ash. The creature screeches, then uses its tail to propel itself clear of the table and disappear down a hallway, leaving the crew stunned and horrified.A quick search through the deck yields no results whatsoever. After a short funeral for Kane, where his body is jettisoned into space, the crew members separate into two teams to capture the small creature. Brett assembles a weapon similar to a cattle prod, while Ash rigs together a tracking device. Parker, Brett and Ripley investigate one of the lower decks, finding that the power has been disrupted despite repairs having been finished. Picking up a signal, they think they have the creature cornered in a cabinet. They prepare to catch it in a net, only to be startled by the discovery that it is the crew's cat, Jones, who had found a quiet place inside the cupboard, and runs away. Realizing they might pick up the cat on the tracker again later, Parker sends Brett off to catch Jones. As Brett is searching for Jones, he finds a mysterious object resembling a shed reptile skin on the floor. He continues on to a hold housing one of the ship's landing struts, eventually catching up with Jones. Unknown to Brett, a strange creature is hanging in the chains above him, seemingly observing him. As Brett tries to coax Jones out, the cat hisses when a huge shape drops down behind him. It is the creature, now a six-foot scaly monster with four limbs, an elongated head, and rising to its full height behind the engineer. Brett turns around, and is mesmerized while looking at the creature opening its mouth, revealing a second set of teeth which quickly extends from the mouth, biting Brett in the head, and dragging him, bloodied and screaming, above into an airshaft. Ripley and Parker hear him and arrive just in time to catch a glimpse of the monster as Brett disappears and blood drips down.Parker and Ripley can only confirm the creature is big and escaped through the air ducts. Brett is assumed dead. The crew debates their next move. They all agree that the alien is using the air shafts to move around, so if they could drive it from the ducts into an airlock, they might be able to blow it out into space. Ripley asks Ash if he can offer some helpful information as a scientist; Ash suggests the alien may be afraid of fire, as most animals are. Fortunately, there are several flamethrowers on board. Ripley volunteers to enter the air shafts, but Dallas overrules her by volunteering himself. Dallas enters the MOTHER console once more. He tries to get the MOTHER computer to evaluate their procedure to get rid of the alien, but MOTHER simply cannot provide an answer, due to lack of input. He tries to get MOTHER to offer suggestions, but again, the computer cannot compute, due to lack of available data. Finally, Dallas types ""What are my chances?"" The computer replies that it cannot compute.The main airlock is prepared by Ripley and Ash for the decompression procedure, while Parker and Lambert position themselves where they can measure movement inside the ducts. The main duct is opened and Dallas enters the network of air shafts with a flamethrower, allowing the crew to remote-close valves behind him as he proceeds. Lambert uses a motion tracker to get his location, when she suddenly catches another signal going towards him. Assuming it is the alien, Dallas uses the flamethrower to make sure that one of the ducts leading down is safe. He ascends a ladder to the lower duct, but the alien's signal is lost in the meanwhile. Lambert instructs Dallas to hold position until she can reacquire the Alien's signal, which he does. Next to him, he finds a puddle of slime on the floor. Lambert assures him that the alien cannot be far, so he uses the flame thrower around him to scare it out of hiding; nothing is there. Dallas is disoriented in the cramped space and starts to panic, deciding to try again later. Suddenly Lambert picks up the Alien's signal again, moving at higher speed to his location. Lambert desperately urges him to move away. He descends another ladder and turns around, but finds himself facing the screaming creature, stretching its arms towards him. Static and feedback interrupt the line, and then there is only silence.Parker puts Dallas' flamethrower on the table, saying it was just laying in the duct: ""no blood, no Dallas."" Lambert looks as if she is near a nervous breakdown, while Ripley is desperately trying to hide her apprehension. She suggests that in absence of a better idea, they should continue with Dallas' plan. Lambert disagrees vehemently, and suggests abandoning the ship with the shuttle; however, the shuttle cannot sustain four people. Parker also opposes the idea, and wants to kill the creature; even if this means entering the entire duct system again, and blowing the alien out of the airlock. He leaves on Ripley's orders to refill the flamethrower. Ripley once again tries to get helpful information from Ash, but he says he is still analyzing. She scoffs at him for being so little help, and decides to go and try MOTHER for answers, since she now has access in light of Dallas' absence.Ripley accesses the MOTHER console, and queries MOTHER for answers as to why they are unable to neutralize the alien. MOTHER responds that she cannot clarify. Ripley asks MOTHER to explain why not. MOTHER replies that she cannot, referring to Special Order 937, which is only meant to be read by the science officer. Ripley uses an emergency command override to force MOTHER to explain what Special Order 937 entails. MOTHER displays the following shocking text: ""Nostromo rerouted to new coordinates. Investigate lifeform. Gather specimen. Priority one: insure return of organism for analysis. All other considerations secondary. Crew expendable."" As she contemplates the cold, hard words, she suddenly finds Ash sitting next to her, saying there is an explanation for this. Furiously, she grabs and shouts at him, sobbing uncontrollably. She leaves the console, summoning Parker and Lambert, but she finds that Ash is closing all doors leaving the mess hall, preventing her from leaving. She demands that he open the doors, but Ash simply stares at her. She notices a drop of white liquid running down his face, and he starts to have facial twitches. Unnerved, she tries to run away, but he suddenly grabs her hair; Ripley breaks free, pulling out a lock of hair, and tries to run. Ash quickly catches up and throws her against a few walls. While she is barely conscious, Ash uses a rolled-up magazine in order to suffocate her. She starts to struggle fiercely as Ash starts to twitch and make incoherent noises. Suddenly, Parker and Lambert arrive, both trying to drag Ash away from Ripley. Parker howls in pain as Ash grabs a piece of skin on his chest, forcing him to let go. Parker quickly grabs a fire extinguisher and hits Ash with it in the back. Ash starts to convulse and shriek violently, making very inhuman sounds while spitting out white liquid. Parker gives him another blow with the extinguisher, dislodging Ash's head, revealing Ash is an android. He keeps pounding Ash until he is on the floor, white liquid gushing from its insides. Ash's movements start to decrease and Parker settles down, but suddenly, the decapitated body grabs him and forces him onto a table; Lambert finally grabs the electric prod and screams as she stabs Ash in the back with it, finally rendering the android lifeless.With Ash disabled, Ripley theorizes that the Company sent him along to bring an alien back for their weapons division, as Ash was always very protective of the creature. They reconnect his disembodied head to see if he can give them any advice on how to deal with the creature. Ash confirms that his order was to bring back the lifeform, even if it meant sacrificing the crew. Ripley asks how they can kill the creature. He tells them simply, 'You can't', as it is ""the perfect organism"". He has a silent admiration for it, ""a survivor, unclouded by conscience, remorse and delusions of morality"". Ash taunts their chances against the creature, infuriating Parker and causing Ripley to disconnect him again. The three survivors decide to follow Lambert's earlier suggestion; set the Nostromo to self-destruct and escape in the shuttle, leaving the Alien to die on the main ship. As they leave the room, Parker turns the flamethrower on Ash's corpse, incinerating his remains. Ripley will prepare the shuttle for launch, while Parker and Lambert go to gather coolant for the shuttle's life-support system.While prepping the shuttle, Ripley hears Jones meowing on the ship's open intercom system, and realizes the cat is still left behind. Lambert and Parker are in the hold gathering equipment. They proceed to a small room where the coolant is stored, and start to pressurize the coolant bottles. Ripley ventures out alone, into the hallways of the Nostromo to find Jones the cat. Expecting the alien at every turn, Ripley finally locates the cat in the cockpit, where he startles her as he suddenly jumps into view. She puts him into his traveling container.In the storage room, Parker and Lambert are so focused on the supplies, that neither of them sees a large shadow that has appeared inside the room. It is the Alien, and it corners Lambert against a wall where she had been filling coolant bottles. Ripley can hear Parker over the open intercom, shouting to Lambert to get out of the way, but the alien has cornered her against the wall. Parker is unable to get a clear shot at it with the flamethrower without risking harm to Lambert, as it is hulking over her. Finally, he charges at the creature, but it rapidly spins, whipping the flamethrower out of his hands with its long tail, and grabbing him with its large claws. Parker fights against the creature's grip while shouting a warning to Lambert to get out, but she is frozen with fright and does not move. The Alien spreads its outer jaws to reveal the pistonlike inner throat and penetrating teeth, and as Parker screams a warning the creature's teeth penetrate Parker's skull, killing him. As Ripley rushes towards their position, she is powerless to prevent the creature from turning back to Lambert. It curls its tail around her, and the final thing that Ripley can hear from the intercom are the sounds of Lambert, crying, sobbing, gagging and screaming - followed by silence. Ripley finds their bloodied and lifeless bodies in the storage room, with no sign of the alien.In terrible shock, Ripley dashes towards the emergency room without stopping. Between the sobs, she locates the ship's self-destruct mechanism and quickly completes the entire procedure to activate it. The voice of MOTHER now announces that the self-destruct mechanism has been activated, and the ship will detonate in 10 minutes; however, the self-destruct can still be canceled during the first five minutes. Ripley takes a ladder to the lower deck, where she hears a soft groan. She inspects the hold, and finds a strange organic structure adhering to the walls and machinery. Shocked, she finds Dallas stuck within the adhesive, barely alive. On the opposite wall, she notices a shape which vaguely resembles Brett; he seems to be dissolving, transforming into an object like the eggs seen in the derelict ship. Dallas very weakly begs Ripley to kill him. After some hesitation, she grants his dying request: she burns them both with the flamethrower and rushes out of the chamber.Ripley crawls up a ladder, and runs towards the shuttle with Jones in the container. She briefly rests against a wall, when she suddenly hears the alien stirring around the corner. Terrified, she drops the cat container and carefully retraces her steps along the wall, as the alien slowly comes into view around the corner. It shows interest in Jones. The alien slams the container against a wall. Ripley races back to the self-destruct mechanism and tries to override the procedure; however, she is too late, as the mechanism is already starting to activate. She restarts the cooling unit, but MOTHER announces that it is too late to stop the countdown, and the Nostromo will explode in five minutes, much to Ripley's frustrated anger. With sirens blaring and steam releasing from the vents, Ripley runs back to the shuttle loading area, ready to make her best attempt to fight off the alien and get into the lifeboat. The alien is nowhere to be seen, only the cat container lying on its side. As fires start to erupt, she picks up Jones and boards the shuttle with only one minute to abandon ship. She quickly runs through the launch sequence, and the shuttle lowers to launch position as MOTHER starts counting down the last 30 seconds of the Nostromo's life. The shuttle's engines ignite and the shuttle races away, leaving the Nostromo in the distance. Three massive explosions follow as the Nostromo's engines detonate, destroying the ship, the refinery and ore it had been towing, and, apparently - also the Alien.Ripley gives Jones a hug and prepares one of the biobeds for hypersleep, putting Jones in it. As she makes final preparations for the shuttle, a hand suddenly reaches out to her from a wall; she shrieks, and in horror, she sees the alien lying in an alcove. In fact, it had stowed away aboard the shuttle, its external physicality making it blend in with the ship's machinery. She flees into a locker with space suits inside, and notices the alien is not following her; it remains lying in the alcove, seemingly unable to do something. Suddenly, Ripley gets an idea, and stealthily dons one of the space suits. Exiting the locker, she arms herself with a harpoon gun, then straps herself into a chair while singing ""You Are My Lucky Star"" to calm her nerves. Opening a series of air vents above the alien's head, Ripley tests them one at a time, and then finds one that directly blasts high-pressure steam onto the alien, driving it shrieking from its hiding spot. As she is activating several buttons, she does not notice the monster creeping up to her from the side, until it is standing next to her to its full, menacing two-meter height, ready to attack with its inner jaw. Screaming, she opens the shuttle's airlock door. Everything not secured, including the alien, blasts towards the door. However, the alien grabs the edges of the doorway to prevent itself from being sucked outside. Ripley quickly fires her harpoon before the creature is able to haul itself in; it pierces the screaming alien, which lets go of the doorway and blasts outside, the wire connecting the gun to the harpoon pulling the gun out of Ripley's hands. However, the door slams shut, jamming the wire under it. Still tethered to the door by the wire, the alien undauntedly attempts to re-enter the shuttle by climbing inside one of the heat thrusters. However, Ripley sees the opportunity and fires the engines, incinerating the alien, and sending it drifting into space, where the incredibly tough creature finally succumbs to differential pressure and blows apart.Before she and Jones enter hypersleep for the journey home, Ripley records a final log entry, stating that Kane, Lambert, Parker, Brett, Ash and Captain Dallas are dead. Cargo and ship are destroyed. She expects to reach the frontier in six weeks, and to be picked up by the network. She signs off as Ripley, last survivor of the Nostromo, and gets into hypersleep for the journey back to Earth."

10,1979,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078721/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A Hollywood composer goes through a mid-life crisis and becomes infatuated with a sexy, newly married woman. Forty-two year old famed composer and playwright George Webber (Dudley Moore) is going through a midlife crisis. He is seriously dating thirty-eight year old actress and singer Samantha Taylor (Dame Julie Andrews), who he loves, although he admits their connection is more intellectual than it is emotional. She, in turn, loves him, despite barely tolerating his often infantile behavior. This behavior includes spying on a neighbor's sexual encounters with a wide array of women, this spying about which the neighbor knows, as he does it himself. Driving one day, George spots a young woman who he believes is the most beautiful creature he's ever seen - an ""eleven"" on a scale of ten, tens which he didn't believe existed before her. Beyond the fact that she is probably half his age, a problem with George's infatuation is that she is just off to her own wedding. George and Sam's relationship takes a hit with an argument which is further exacerbated by a series of misunderstandings. As such, George decides to pursue the woman of his dreams with all of his energy. He learns her name is Jenny Miles, now married Jenny Hanley (Bo Derek), and he is able to follow her to a Mexican resort where she and her husband David Hanley (Sam J. Jones) are honeymooning. In his pursuit of Jenny, his encounter with a lonely woman named Mary Lewis (Dee Wallace), who is vacationing at the resort, and his discussions with his gay lyricist Hugh (Robert Webber) concerning his relationship with his much younger trophy husband Larry (Walter George Alton), George may come to a clearer picture of what he is doing in Mexico, and how he truly feels about Sam.—Huggo On the night of his 42nd birthday, George Webber (Dudley Moore), a popular songwriter, begins showing symptoms of a ""middle-age crisis"". Over the succeeding weeks, he finds himself continually staring at young girls on the street, and he begins envying his high-living neighbor, whose life is one endless orgy. George's behavior causes great concern to his lover, singing star Samantha Taylor (Dame Julie Andrews), and to his partner Hugh (Robert Webber), who has seemingly avoided George's dilemma by being gay. While driving home one afternoon, George spots Jenny Hanley (Bo Derek), a stunning young beauty en route to her marriage ceremony. Regarding her as ""the most beautiful girl I've ever seen"" (on a scale from one to ten), George follows her to the church. He later learns her name, and discovers that she and her husband are honeymooning in Mexico. Driven by the impulse to see her again, George flies to Mexico and checks into the hotel where Jenny is staying. Later, he sees the couple on the beach, and begins indulging in romantic fantasies about the lovely young girl. When he rescues her husband from drowning, a grateful Jenny invites George to her room.—alfiehitchie During a surprise 42nd birthday party for George Webber, a well-known composer of popular music, he finds himself coping badly with incipient middle age. When he catches a glimpse of a mysterious woman en route to her wedding, he is instantly obsessed by her beauty, and - despite the presence of his lover Samantha Taylor - follows the woman to the church where he crashes into a police cruiser and is stung by a bee. George visits the priest, and learns that the woman is Jenny Miles, daughter of a prominent Beverly Hills dentist. Later that night, Sam and George have an argument about George's failure to give her the attention she needs, his use of the term ""broad"", and the fact that he and his neighbor (a wealthy porn producer) watch each other perform carnal acts using telescopes. The final straw for Sam occurs when George makes a remark subtly impugning her femininity at which point Sam leaves in a huff.The following day, George and Sam suffer a series of mishaps that prevent them from reconciling, including George spying on his neighbor until hitting himself with his telescope and falling down an embankment, causing him to miss Sam's phone call. In addition, George schedules a dental appointment with Jenny's father, and while in the dentist's chair, subtly leads the dentist into disclosing that his daughter and her husband went to Mexico for their honeymoon. The examination also reveals a mouthful of cavities, requiring the dentist to spend the entire afternoon inserting fillings in George's teeth. The after effects of the novocaine, which are aggravated by his heavy drinking immediately after, leave him completely incoherent and when Sam finally reaches him on the phone she mistakes him for a madman and calls the police. The police storm his house, but recognizing him they leave amicably. He visits his neighbor's house to take part in an orgy just as Sam arrives at his house, and she spots him through his telescope, widening the rift between them.Later, George impulsively follows the newlyweds to their exclusive hotel in Manzanillo, Colima, Mexico. In the bar, George encounters an old acquaintance, Mary Lewis, who suffers from a lack of self-confidence because she blames herself for a series of failed relationships. When they attempt a fling that night, she interprets George's inadequacy in bed as confirmation of her insecurities despite her better-than-average looks and easygoing disposition.One hot day at the beach, George sees Jenny - suntanned and dressed in a one-piece swimsuit and her hair braided in cornrows - which furthers George's obsession. He notices that David, Jenny's husband, has fallen asleep on his surfboard. Pretending to inquire about renting a surfboard, George learns that beyond a certain point are powerful currents that can sweep a swimmer or surfer dangerously far from land. George rents a catamaran, clumsily but successfully rescues David, and becomes a hero. Both Sam and his songwriting partner see him on TV Network News and Sam tries to call him, but George (unaware that it is Sam) refuses the call. David, badly sunburned, stays in the hospital, allowing Jenny and George to spend time alone together, culminating in Jenny seducing him to the sounds of Ravel's Boléro.Although George is initially elated to find all of his fantasies being fulfilled, he is horrified when Jenny takes a call from her husband while in bed with him and casually informs him of George's presence. He is even more confused when David responds with a complete lack of concern (he had called to thank George for saving his life). When Jenny explains their open relationship and mutual honesty, George is appalled; with the thrill of enjoying forbidden pleasures extinguished, he loses interest in Jenny (Jenny, for the opposite reasons, loses interest in him as well) and he heads back to Beverly Hills.At the end of the film, he reconciles with Sam by demonstrating a new maturity and, taking an idea from Jenny, he starts Ravel's Boléro on the phonograph and they make love with the music playing in the background. This is in full view of the neighbor's telescope shortly after the neighbor has walked away in disgust, complaining that he has had enough of providing erotic entertainment to George and getting nothing in return."

Moonraker,1979,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0079574/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"James Bond investigates the mid-air theft of a space shuttle, and discovers a plot to commit global genocide. James Bond is back for another mission and this time, he is blasting off into space. A spaceship travelling through space is mysteriously hijacked and Bond must work quickly to find out who was behind it all. He starts with the rockets creators, Drax Industries and the man behind the organization, Hugo Drax. On his journey he ends up meeting Dr. Holly Goodhead and encounters the metal-toothed Jaws once again.—simon No one knows who is behind the audacious mid-air hijacking of the state-of-the-art Drax Industries Moonraker space shuttle: a spacecraft on loan from the U.S. government to Great Britain that has disappeared without a trace. To shed light on this critical case, British Agent 007 launches an investigation from sunny California and Drax's space research facility, unaware that his presence has already drawn unwanted attention. As the unstoppable adversary fromThe Spy Who Loved Me (1977)enters the equation, Bond teams up with NASA scientist Dr Holly Goodhead to ferret out the culprit in a time-sensitive quest for clues across the globe. However, humankind's future is hanging by a thread. Can James Bond thwart the criminal mastermind's evil plan before it is too late?—Nick Riganas A space shuttle called the Moonraker, built by Drax Industries, is on its way to the U.K. when it is hijacked in mid-air and the crew of the 747 carrying it is killed. Bond immediately is called into action, and starts the investigation with Hugo Drax. While at the Drax laboratories, Bond meets the brilliant and stunning Dr. Holly Goodhead, a N.A.S.A. astronaut and C.I.A. Agent who is investigating Drax for the U.S. Government. One of Drax's thugs, the sinister Chan, attempts to kill 007 at the lab, but when that fails, he follows Bond to Venice and tries again there. Bond and Goodhead follow Drax's trail to Brazil, where they once again run into the seven-foot Goliath Jaws, a towering giant with metal teeth. Escaping from him, they discover the existence of a huge space station undetected by U.S. or Soviet radar, and a horrible plot by Drax to employ nerve gas in a genocidal project. James and Holly must quickly find a way to stop Hugo Drax before his horrific plans can be put into effect.—Derek O'Cain A space shuttle is stolen enroute to London and M sends James Bond out to apologize to the shuttle creator, billionaire Hugo Drax. While visiting Drax's estate, several attempts are made on Bond's life, making Drax the number one suspect. Bond also meets Dr. Holly Goodhead, a N.A.S.A. scientist, who is also a C.I.A. Agent investigating Drax. Their investigations lead Bond to discover a plot to murder the world's population so that Drax can repopulate the planet in his image. The chase takes Bond all over the world, California, Brazil, the Amazon James, and, finally, to Drax's huge space-city over the Earth. Drax, meanwhile, has hired a old friend of Bond to take care of any problems, the steel-toothed killer Jaws.—Lee Horton <Leeh@tcp.co.uk> The 1st part of the pre-title teaser shows a space shuttle (called a ""Moonraker"") being carried on a large cargo plane. Inside the shuttle, two men emerge from hidden compartments and start launch procedures for the shuttle. They fly off, destroying the cargo plane they were being ferried on. The shuttle was built for the British government and was en route there when it was stolen over the Yukon Territory in Canada. M, head of MI6, orders Miss Moneypenny to contact his best agent, James Bond, and have him report in. Moneypenny says that Bond is currently in flight, returning from a mission in Africa. On board the private jet, Bond is betrayed by the flight attendant and the plane's captain. The flight attendant escapes and Bond briefly battles with the pilot, throwing him from the plane. As Bond watches the man slip away, he is pushed out of the plan by Jaws (who returns from The Spy Who Loved Me). Bond plummets and is able to catch the pilot and wrestles his chute from him. As he puts it on and free-falls, he is attacked by Jaws, but Bond pulls the chord on his own chute; Jaws tries the same but his chute doesn't open. He is seen falling into a circus tent; the first animated image of the opening title sequence suggests he fell into the high-wire safety net inside (in an unused scene, Jaws staggers unharmed to his feet and watches Bond land harmlessly miles away).Bond reports to M's office where Q and Minister of Defense Sir Frederick Gray are waiting. They report that the shuttle went missing somewhere over the Yukon Territory and, while the plane wreckage has been found, there's no sign of the Moonraker. Bond is ordered to begin his investigation of the shuttle's disappearance at the industrial complex where it was built by the Drax Corporation. Before he leaves, Bond is given a new wristwatch by Q that can fire specialized darts - one type are steel-tipped and armor piercing, the others contain cyanide.Bond travels to California, posing as a British government official and is taken by pilot Corinne Dufour over the vast industrial station of Drax Industries and to the estate of industrialist and billionaire, Hugo Drax, for a brief meeting. The estate is at the edge of a forest straddling the Mojave Desert, and it impresses James for its vast size and built entirely with stones brought in from France. It also doubles as an exercise ground for astronaut trainees.Drax thanks Bond for appearing in person to apologize for the loss of his shuttle. Bond, however, is not there to apologize and, though he asks about the mysterious disappearance of the shuttle, he receives no conclusive answers. Bond is taken to meet Dr Holly Goodhead, who gives him a tour of the facilities. She suggests that Bond try out the g-force training vehicle. While he rides in it, Drax' personal bodyguard, Chang, refits the control panel (disabling the kill switch for the vehicle) and attempts to kill Bond with a fatal amount of g-force. Bond disables the machine by shooting one of the darts given to him by Q into the control panel. While Goodhead apologizes, a very shaken Bond refuses her help and sees Chang leaving the control room.Later that evening, after recovering from the nausea of the centrifuge, Bond meets Miss Dufour; he charms her and they make love. He sneaks out of her room and into Drax' private office. Dufour discovers him there but does not attempt to stop him. Bond finds Drax' safe and photographs engineering schematics for a small electronic device and a larger pod of some sort both made by a glass company called Venini, located in Venice, Italy. As he and Dufour slip out of the office, they don't notice that Chang sees them go. The next morning, before he's scheduled to leave, Bond is asked to join Drax for pheasant hunting. During the match, Bond slyly kills an assassin planted nearby by Drax. He leaves just as Dufour arrives. Knowing of her betrayal, Drax tells her that she's fired; he lets his trained Beaucerons loose and they chase her through the forest, killing her.Bond arrives in Venice, going immediately to the Venini glass works indicated in the plans he stole. He finds several workers making small containers that match the dimensions of those in the schematics. Joining a tour of the factory, he sees Holly Goodhead, who quickly leaves. Bond catches up with her and asks to meet her later, which she refuses. Bond heads off in a gondola - while floating down a canal, he is attacked by a knife-throwing assassin in a coffin, who kills Bond's pilot. Bond is able to kill him and activates the gondola's power motor and takes off. He is chased though the canals by two more men in a powerboat but eludes them by entering Venice's Grand Canal and activating the gondola's hovercraft which he rides into St. Mark's Square.Bond returns that night to Venini & finds a laboratory where two scientists are working in a highly secured lab. He notices a pod that matches the schematics from Drax' safe that contains some of the small glass containers he'd seen earlier. In the small containers are small electronic devices that contain vials of a clear fluid. Hearing the scientists returning, he hides, leaving one of the devices with the vials teetering on the edge of a globe, where it falls to the floor and shatters when the men move the pod. The liquid quickly becomes aerosol and the room is automatically sealed. Bond observes that both men die very quickly but the animals in cages in the room do not. As he leaves, Bond is attacked by a man wearing Japanese kendo gear, who is soon revealed to be Chang. The two carry their combat into the Venini glassware museum and destroy it. They fight further, ending up behind a glass clock overlooking a fine restaurant. As they continue the fight, Bond notices crates that are bound for Rio de Janeiro that contain the large pods he'd seen in the lab. Eventually, Bond throws Chang headfirst through the clock into a grand piano, killing him.Bond arrives later at Goodhead's hotel and finds her in her room. He reveals his knowledge of her being a CIA agent. The two spend the night together after Bond finds an airline ticket in her name to Rio de Janeiro. Bond leaves early in the morning and escorts M and Minister Gray to the Drax laboratory he'd found the night before. When they enter, the lab has been cleared out and all traces of the pods, vials and other experimental equipment are gone; only Drax remains in a lavishly decorated office. Gray apologizes for the intrusion and, after leaving the office, orders M to take Bond off the case. Bond gives M the vial he'd stolen the previous night and tells M to have it tested by Q with ""extreme caution"" due to is deadly nature. M tells Bond to take two weeks leave and asks where he'll go; Bond says he'll go to Rio de Janeiro to follow Goodhead and the Venini pods.Bond arrives in Rio and begins to investigate again. During carnivale, he and his assistant, Manuela, find another storage facility owned by Drax, where Bond finds a shipping label from Drax Airfreight. In the street, Manuela is approached by a carnivale-goer in a large costume; it is Jaws, a hulking henchman with steel teeth hired by Drax soon after Chang was killed. Bond arrives, though he is unable to fend off Jaws completely, but the henchman is whisked away by another passing group of celebrators.The next day, Bond takes a cable car to a observation platform overlooking Rio. He sees that planes belonging to Drax Airfreight are taking off from a nearby small airport. On the mountain, he once again finds Holly Goodhead, who tells him that the Drax planes have been departing frequently, every two hours. They both decide to return to Rio to investigate further, however, their cable car descent is interrupted by Jaws who bites through the heavy cable with his steel teeth, halting their car midway down. Bond and Goodhead battle the thug and are able to escape when Bond loops a chain around a cable and they slide down. Jaws follows in one of the cars but is unable to stop, colliding with the station at the bottom. As he tries to remove a wheel from his neck, he meets a young blond woman with large glasses, Dolly, who helps him and the two fall instantly in love.Bond and Goodhead, having leaped from the chain before reaching the cable house, are picked up by an ambulance. The paramedics are likely Drax' men and the two are bound to their gurneys. Bond escapes his and is thrown from the ambulance, but Goodhead is unable to escape.Bond reports to the new headquarters M and Q have set up outside Rio; Q reports that his analysis of the fluid in the vial reveals that it came from a rare orchid from the Amazonian Jungle region. The fluid, which originally caused sterility in the native tribe that inhabited the area, has been modified to cause death in humans only. Bond travels in a highly specialized boat to the Amazon and is engaged once again by Jaws and several henchmen in boats. Bond uses the defenses of his own boat to destroy most of them and escapes over a large grouping of waterfalls (they are actually the Iguazu Falls, hundreds of miles away near Argentina) by using a hang glider. Jaws winds up going over the falls in his boat. Bond crash-lands in the jungle where he spies a beautiful woman and follows her to a lagoon; he is cast into a pool where a large python is sent to kill him. Bond kills the snake with Goodhead's poison-tipped pen and is grabbed by Jaws. He is taken to Drax' control room where the launching of several Moonraker shuttles is being observed. Drax reveals that he'd originally ordered the theft of the British Moonraker because one of the original fleet developed a last-minute malfunction. Drax orders Bond to be taken to a conference room directly below the launchpad of one of the shuttles where Goodhead is trapped. Drax leaves them there to be incinerated during the launch. They escape the room and assume the identities of two Moonraker crew members after rendering them unconscious. They board the last Moonraker and are launched into space on a programmed flight plan. Bond checks the cargo area and sees several young couples as passengers; upon this sight James analogizes the scene to the story of Noah's Ark.In space, the Moonrakers arrive at a space station, hidden from detection on Earth by a radar cloaking device. The station is activated and Drax initiates his ultimate plan: he will launch the fluid extracted from the orchids into the atmosphere of Earth where they will exterminate human life, leaving vegetation and animal life behind. The couples that he has brought into space will breed and their descendants will return to Earth as a new race of humans to populate it. Bond and Goodhead find the station's radar jammer and deactivate it, making the station visible from Earth. The US Air Force in the person of General Scott contacts Soviet General Gogol reassuring him the now-visible station doesn't belong to the United States, and the Air Force launches a shuttle with a US Marine strike team towards the station.Bond and Goodhead are discovered by Jaws who takes them to Drax. Bond remarks aloud that the only humans who will be allowed to live are those like Drax' ""perfect specimens"", IE, those who are physically fit and genetically superior. Jaws suddenly realizes that Drax' plan will not include either himself, because of his abnormal size and his steel teeth and Dolly because of her imperfect vision. Jaws decides to join forces with Bond and attacks the guards. A fight breaks out in space as the US shuttle arrives. Eventually, the marines gain entry to the station. Drax continues to order the launching of the deadly pods. He is found escaping by Bond who fires one of his cyanide darts at Drax; he pushes the villain into an airlock and blasts him into space to his death. Meanwhile, the strike team has taken out the station team and fly away before the station, suffering catastrophic damage, explodes. Jaws and Dolly enjoy a celebratory moment together with champagne, Jaws stating, ""Well, here's to us!"", (his only spoken words in the Bond series). Goodhead and Bond escape in Drax' shuttle with the help of Jaws, when their docking system can't be disengaged. Drax' shuttle is armed with a high-powered laser that Bond and Goodhead will use on the orbiting pods. Jaws and Dolly plummet back to Earth in portion of the station.Bond and Goodhead race towards the pods, destroying them all with the shuttle's laser cannon. Bond is forced to destroy the last one without the weapon's malfunctioning computer targeting system, but succeeds. Back on Earth, M an Q try to locate Bond, who is orbiting the earth in the shuttle and enjoying a gravity-free romantic tryst with Goodhead."
The Electric Horseman,1979,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0079100/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A rodeo star past his prime steals his company's horse and rides into the desert, accompanied by a feisty reporter. Sonny Steele used to be a rodeo star, but his next appearance is to be on a Las Vegas stage, wearing a suit covered in lights, advertising a breakfast cereal. When he finds out that they are planning to drug the horse in case it is too frisky, he rides off into the desert on it.—Colin Tinto <cst@imdb.com> After retiring from the rodeo where he was five-time all-around world rodeo champion, Sonny Steele is signed by multinational conglomerate Ampco to be the spokesman for their breakfast cereal, Ranch Breakfast. This corporate job, where he is paraded around on horses in electrically-lit cowboy get-ups and the publicity department makes him grow a mustache to look more like a cowboy, eventually sucks his soul away, and he takes up the bottle and often turns up drunk at events, so the publicity department tries to hide him from the media. At a corporate-wide Ampco event in Las Vegas, television reporter Hallie Martin senses that there is a story in Sonny being hidden by his own publicity machine. That event also marks the last straw for Sonny with Ampco as he is to appear with Ampco's acquisition, a $12-million race-horse named Rising Star. Although Sonny is willing to be denigrated by Ampco, he refuses to let them do the same to Rising Star, whom they drug to sedate at such public events and to make him look cosmetically more pleasing, all at his expense. Sonny decides to steal Rising Star and actually ride off into the sunset. Hot on their tail are the Ampco executives--who want to keep the story as quiet as possible to not tarnish their brand, the police, and Hallie. Hallie does all she can to get the story straight from Sonny's mouth, so much better if hers are the only cameras rolling at the time. But as she catches up with him and by circumstance spends extended alone time with him and Rising Star, her priorities of getting the story at any cost might change to helping Sonny elude capture and achieve his end goal with Rising Star. But that goal could be jeopardized by Hallie's earlier priorities, which are still those of her network.—Huggo"
The China Syndrome,1979,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078966/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A reporter finds what appears to be a cover-up of safety hazards at a nuclear power plant. While doing a series of reports on alternative energy sources, a reporter, Kimberly Wells, witnesses an accident at a nuclear power plant. Wells is determined to report the incident but soon finds herself entangled in a sinister conspiracy to keep the full impact of the incident a secret.—Dave Jenkins <david.jenkins@smallworld.co.uk> KXLA Television human interest reporter Kimberly Wells aspires to do hard hitting news stories, whereas station brass wants to keep her to her current position; they're more concerned about the color, length and style of her hair than her investigative abilities. While doing a human interest story at the Ventana nuclear power plant, she may have stumbled onto her dream story when on-site she witnesses what she thinks is a near nuclear disaster. Her freelance cameraman and friend, Richard Adams, clandestinely films the event as it unfolds in Ventana's control room. However, station brass quashes the story due in part to liability issues. Although disappointed, Kimberly initially follows her boss' directives as she wants to protect her career path, whereas Richard wants to use the film to really find out what happened. Uncovering the truth hits an early snag when the regulatory commission reports that the plant faced no major issue during the incident. Both Kimberly and Richard believe the quick and favorable report was due to the fact that development of another nuclear power plant is currently going through the public consultation process. Back at the plant, Jack Godell, the supervisor on duty in the control room during the incident, believes that something indeed is wrong with the plant due to the event, when he felt a tremor on-site. His beliefs are strengthened due to some radioactive leak in the plant from an unknown source and the discovery of some falsified documents, the latter which he knows may be a threat to his life by the perpetrators. Jack, with Kimberly and Richard's help, does whatever he can to get his story into the public consciousness to avert what he thinks is a potential nuclear meltdown at the plant. But the power company is determined to keep Jack quiet and to protect their billion dollar investment, namely Ventana.—Huggo TV news reporter Kimberly Wells (Jane Fonda) and her freelance cameraman Richard Adams (Michael Douglas) visit the Ventana nuclear power plant outside Los Angeles as part of a series of news reports on energy production. Kimberly is an ambitious reporter who wants to become a ""hard news"" reporter, however, her superiors seem to be holding her back due to inexperience at reporting hard news and perhaps because she's a woman. As such, Kimberly reports stories of local interest that contain little substance.While watching the Ventana control room from an observation area with public relations officer, Bill Gibson, the plant suddenly starts to rumble: it's going through a reactor ""SCRAM"", a temporary shutdown of part or all of the plant. Shift supervisor Jack Godell (Jack Lemmon), initially believing the SCRAM to be standard, notices what he believes to be an unusual vibration. On the control console, a chart recorder indicates that the water level in the reactor core has risen to an abnormally high level. The crew begins opening relief valves in an effort to prevent too much water from damaging the plant, but the chart continues to indicate an off-scale level. Minutes later a crew member notices an alternate gauge on the control panel showing that the water level is dangerously low. Suspecting that the recorder pen may be stuck, Godell taps on the glass cover. He and crew chief Ted Spindler (Wilford Brimley) watch, sickened, as the pen trace rapidly drops to show that the water level is now mere inches away from exposing the reactor core, and still falling. The staff scrambles to close the relief valves and restore the coolant systems, but for several agonizing minutes they believe the core will undergo a disastrous meltdown. Eventually, backup systems are able to slow and reverse the falling water level, and the reactor is brought under control.In the observation gallery looking over the control room, Richard, when told he was not permitted to film the control room for security reasons, has tucked the camera under his arm and surreptitiously films the incident. Because the glass is soundproof, the visitors can only guess as to what is happening, however, the panic of the crew is quite apparent, as is their relief when the danger has passed.When they return to the television station, excited about the event and the illegal footage they have of it, the station's news director, Don Jacovich (Peter Donat) after receiving a phone call from his superior, refuses to air the footage, citing federal law and fearing criminal prosecution from Ventana's parent company. Jacovich orders the film to be stored in the vault until the investigation of the accident is completed. Richard and Kimberly protest but Jacovich still refuses to allow the story.A day or two later Kimberly meets with Jacovich and Richard, who are arguing loudly over the official statement released by Ventana, which referred to the near-meltdown as an ""unanticipated transient"", a term that makes no sense. Jacovich also explains the federal law that prevents them from broadcasting Richard's film, emphasizing that it's a felony to do so. Believing that there is more to the story than is indicated in the plant's official statement, Richard insults Jacovich and steals the film from the station vault. When she returns home, Kimberly finds a harsh message on her answering machine from Richard, who plainly believes Kimberly should have stood behind him.An official investigation by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is held and each Ventana employee present at the SCRAM is interviewed for several hours. They are later exonerated by the NRC which concludes that while some errors by personnel were recorded, they still did their jobs adequately. Kimberley Wells travels to a bar near the plant where it's employees often go and meets Godell himself, celebrating the NRC's ruling with his fellow employees. She asks him a few hard line questions about the safety of the plant, however Godell tells her the plant is safe and that there are backup systems to handle problems like the recent event that took place. Kimberly notes that Godell seems a bit nervous about the plant's safety.Suspicious that there may be more errors to investigate, Jack dons a radiation suit and examines the defective water pump himself with a Geiger counter. He finds an area where nuclear material has leaked onto the floor. His supervisor, Herman, quickly orders a cleanup and tells Jack not to reveal the problem to anyone and to get the plant up and running. Jack does so with obvious reluctance and leaves work for the day.Godell does some investigating of his own and uncovers evidence that the plant is unsafe. Specifically, he finds evidence that the welds for the water pumps were not properly X-rayed to show their integrity. Godell concludes that another reactor SCRAM at full power could cause the cooling system to be severely damaged which would result in a catastrophic meltdown. Godell asks the plant foreman, Herman, to delay restarting the reactor but he refuses, under pressure from the plant's owners, who stand to lose millions of dollars each day the plant remains ""off line."" Herman orders Jack to get the plant up to full power again. A brief test is run to see if the repairs made to the water pump are secure. Jack watches the monitors closely and Herman deems the repairs to be adequate. Jack, looking distressed, has his crew follow standard procedure to bring the plant gradually up to full power.When he leaves for the day, Godell steals some of the damning x-ray films taken by the construction company that built the plant. At a construction site, he talks to one of the firm's officers, showing him the questionable x-ray. When Jack gets no satisfaction, he threatens to go to the NRC himself. The officer tells Jack that the firm has it's own security force that could be sent to harass or harm him.Kimberley talks to Richard's business partner, Hector, and finds out that Richard, who hasn't been heard from for several days, is at a convention of nuclear scientists in LA. She finds Richard there and he tells her he's showing the film to a couple of nuclear power experts; a physicist and an engineer. The two scientists determine that the plant very nearly went into meltdown, called the ""China Syndrome"" where the nuclear material heats beyond the capacity of the plant's personnel and safety systems to stop it. Reaching ground water under the plant, the material would explode into the atmosphere, rendering most of southern California radioactive and an uninhabitable wasteland for decades and possibly causing illnesses like cancer in the region's inhabitants. Kimberly and Richard both go to Godell's house and confront him directly, saying they know that Godell and his team narrowly avoided a meltdown. Godell, more nervous than he was before, tells them that he agrees with them and tells them about the false X-rays and the cost-cutting measures done by the contracting company. He also tells them that he was threatened by the firm if he goes to the NRC. Kimberly and Richard agree to keep Godell's identity anonymous if he can get them some of the incriminating evidence to present at the conference where Richard had talked to the two nuclear scientists.Richard arranges for Godell to meet Hector with a bundle of the x-ray film, but while Hector drives to the convention to deliver them, he's run off the road by security agents from the contracting firm. Kimberly calls Godell and asks him to speak directly to the convention committee himself. On the way there, he is chased by more hit men and is unable to join Kimberly. He's able to evade them for a few minutes but they catch up on the highway. He drives to Ventana, knowing the men following him won't be permitted past the plant's security gates.Already nervous, Godell rushes to the control room and finds the plant is nearly at full power. Now convinced of the evidence and unable to stop the power-up, he grabs a gun from the control room's security guard and forces everyone out. Once alone and secured inside the control room, he brings the power down to a safer level. He also tells the plant's managers that if anyone attempts to take control of the reactor from the outside or break in, he'll open valves and flood the containment building with radiation, which would render the plant unusable. He then demands to be interviewed by Wells on live television. Ventana's CEO, Evan McCormack (Richard Herd), speaks to Herman and Bill and allows them to tell the media to interview Jack.Kimberly arrives and is escorted into the control room. Godell tells her that he'll voice his concerns about the plant's safety on live television. Kimberly contacts Richard, who contacts every other major television network. In the hour it takes for them to arrive, the plant's parent McCormack orders Herman to find a way to cause a reactor SCRAM. The SCRAM, if plotted correctly, will distract Godell long enough for the rest of the team to seize control of the plant. After Richard leads the TV production teams into the same observation room he original filmed in, he misses seeing the SWAT team that arrives right after the news van to deal with Godell himself.Kimberly begins to interview Godell, who speaks frantically and makes little sense while explaining the more technical aspects of the recent accident. In the middle of the live interview, the SCRAM is started and the camera's cables are physically cut by the SWAT team. Godell begins to panic, rushing from one control panel to the next, trying to avert a catastrophe. The SWAT team suddenly bursts into the control room and shoots Godell. Kimberly tries desperately to help him, however, Godell, near death, tells her ""I can feel it..."" An ominous vibration, like the one Godell felt in the first incident, shakes the room. More alarms begin to sound and the SCRAM causes significant damage to the plant, as portions of the cooling system physically collapse. The reactor is eventually brought under control by the plant's automatic systems and by Spindler. When the incident ends, Kimberley sees that Godell has died.Outside the plant, a phalanx of reporters and television crews are awaiting word on the events inside. When the plant spokesman suggests that Godell was ""emotionally disturbed"" and that he ""had been drinking"", Kimberly Wells confronts the spokesman in front of the other reporters, and eventually gets one of Godell's co-workers, Ted Spindler, to admit that Godell would not have taken such drastic steps had there not been something dangerous about the plant.

The four discuss luck, art, courage, and, after Tracy leaves for the restroom, the remaining three discuss her age. Isaac tells his friends that his ex-wife, Jill, who recently left him for another woman, is writing a book about the breakup of their marriage. This troubles Isaac, because the work will reveal personal details about him and their relationship. Leaving early because Tracy has a high school exam the next morning, the group walks along the sidewalk. As Emily and Tracy follow a few steps behind Yale and Isaac, Yale reveals to Isaac that he is having an affair.One day, Isaac confronts Jill (Meryl Streep) on the street and begs her not to publish the book and expresses concern about their young son, Willy, who is now being raised by Jill and her life partner Connie (Karen Ludwig).At his apartment in the evening, Isaac and Tracy discuss her past relationships and she tells Isaac that she is in love with him. He is less committal and suggests that she not be so quick to jump to that conclusion. She questions his feelings for her but he in turn argues that at her age she should not be limited to just him.At an art exhibit, Isaac and Tracy encounter Yale and his mistress, Mary (Diane Keaton). The four talk about art and philosophy, about which Isaac and Mary, a writer, disagree vehemently. Afterwards, Tracy and Isaac are food shopping and he, still angry, complains about Mary.At the television studio where he works, Isaac becomes frustrated with the results of his material and quits his job. Meeting with Yale afterward, Isaac worries about his newfound unemployment and his financial burdens, which include alimony, child support, and costly rent. Talk also turns to the book Isaac is working on.That evening, at a Museum of Modern Art fundraiser, Isaac runs into Mary. They talk briefly with some of her friends and then the two leave together. While walking, they talk about Isaac quitting his job, his writing, her friends, and her past marriage. After picking up Mary's dog, the two take it for a walk, eventually sitting on a bench together watching the sun come up over the Queensboro Bridge.That morning, Isaac phones Yale and tells him about his evening with Mary and attempts to discern how committed Yale is to her, without admitting that he has become interested in her. Later, Yale and Mary talk about their affair and what direction it is heading.Isaac picks up his son from Jill's house and again pleads with her to not publish the book. She reminds him of his past erratic behavior, including the time he tried to run over her new lover.A day or so later, Mary calls Yale to see if he wants to go out. When he declines, she calls Isaac. They decide to meet, and as they walk together a violent thunderstorm breaks out, causing them to seek shelter in a planetarium. As they walk through the darkness, their relationship develops and Mary confides her frustration with Yale, who is not ready to break up with Emily.Later at dinner, Tracy tells Isaac about an opportunity she has to study acting in London. Although she is reluctant to leave him, he encourages her, saying how good it would be for her.At Bloomingdales one day, Mary and Yale converse about her growing anxiety over their affair. At the same time, Tracy helps Isaac move to a cheaper apartment. On his first night there, they are in bed together, and Isaac complains about the intrusive sounds in the new building, and is similarly bothered by the brown water from the tap.Tracy relates her concerns about their future together, but he remains noncommittal, claiming he wants the best for her. Mary and Yale agree that they have to stop seeing each other, and Yale tells Isaac that he should pursue Mary. Isaac is flattered by the suggestion, but also hesitant. When Isaac and Mary decide to see a movie, they argue again.Back at her home, Isaac tries to kiss Mary, but she resists and instead they discuss their budding relationship. Mary and Isaac spend a day together, visiting a museum and having dinner, eventually spending the night with each other.Sometime later on one afternoon, Isaac meets Tracy outside her school, where she gives him a harmonica as a gift. Isaac again talks about Tracy's age and questions her understanding of love. He says they should not see each other any longer and that he has fallen in love with someone else. Tracy is quite upset, realizing that his earlier expressions of concern for her were really masking his ambivalence. However, Isaac feels the decision should have been expected.In the country together, Mary and Isaac talk about the positive path their relationship is taking, Mary going so far as to say that she could imagine having kids with Isaac.Sometime later, Yale invites Isaac and Mary to spend an evening with him and Emily. The result is an awkward evening for the four of them.While shopping one day, Isaac and Mary run into Jeremiah, her previous romantic partner. Based on Mary's description of him as a great lover, Jeremiah is physically not what Isaac imagined.One night together, Isaac tells Mary she is wasting her talent writing novelizations of movies. Their talk is interrupted by a phone call from Yale, who wants to meet Mary. She refuses, but tells Isaac the call was from someone offering free dance lessons. Later, Isaac tells Emily that publishers have responded favorably to the first four chapters of his book.While shopping in the country, Isaac and Mary, and Yale and Emily notice and purchase a copy of Jill's book. Yale reads aloud from it to everyone's amusement, except, of course, Isaac, who is offended by what he hears.Back in the city, Isaac confronts Jill, who reveals to him that there has already been interest in making the book into a movie. Isaac arrives home to tell Mary about the encounter, but she tells him that she is still in love with Yale, that she has been seeing him again, and that he is actually moving out so that they can be together. Isaac is shocked and promptly rushes to meet Yale at the university where he teaches. Isaac angrily chides his friend and questions his actions.Days later, Emily tells Isaac that she knew about the affair and, unaware of Yale and Mary's previous attachment, says she thinks their breakup was due to Isaac introducing Mary to Yale. Isaac tells Emily that he misses Tracy, noting the pleasant times they spent together.At home alone, Isaac records ideas for a book. In doing so, he contemplates what makes life worthwhile and this line of thought eventually causes him to think about Tracy. He plays briefly on the harmonica then tries to call her. Abruptly, he races out the door and runs several blocks and catches Tracy just before she leaves for London. Isaac tells her about his feelings. He says he made a mistake and does not want her to go and that he loves her. However, it is too late, as her arrangements have already been made. She reassures him that she will only be gone for six months, and then they can be together, concluding that he just needs to have a little faith in people (implying that they might get back together again someday, when she is of legal age).An instrumental version of ""Embraceable You"" plays over the end credits."

Meatballs,1979,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0079540/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Wacky hijinks of counselors and campers at a less-than-average summer camp. Rudy goes to summer camp full of rowdy teenagers. The head counselor is Tripper Harrison, the prank pulling, girl seducing, fun lover, teasing both his boss and the counselors at the nearby rich kids camp. He and everyone else are sick and tired of always losing the Camp Olympics every year, and Tripper must encourage all campers to try their hardest, and even convince young Rudy that this may be his chance to feel better about himself.—Wallace Entertainment Very early in the morning at Camp North Star, an alarm clock wakens the head counselor, Tripper. He dons a kid's space cadet helmet and switches on the camp's PA system. His public service announcement informs the camp's counselors that they should get out of bed and report to for their assigned duties. He also expects that the summer session at the camp will be fun. Tripper forgets to turn the microphone off and takes it into the bathroom with him. The sound of a toilet flushing is heard across the camp. The other counselors are seen doing landscaping, painting, replacing windows and generally getting the camp ready.At the rendezvous for the campers, Tripper has his staff gather the kids and get them on the buses. Some of the kids have bad attitudes and have to be threatened with bodily harm. One of the counselors, Spaz, a nerdy type with taped-together glasses, is met by some counselors from North Star's rival summer camp, Mohawk. They seize his milkshake and pour it over his head. A news reporter is doing a story on Mohawk, which has a much richer budget, a long waiting list, stringent approval standards and seems like a luxury for its campers. Tripper talks to the reporter, posing as Mohawk's program director and gives him bogus information about the camp's activities, including ""Sexual Awareness Week"" when prostitutes are brought into the camp and the campers earn prizes for cavorting with as many as they can.Among the campers is a young kid named Rudy. Shy and lacking in self-confidence, he doesn't want to go to camp but his father insists. The buses bring the campers to North Star where they're assigned to their counselors and cabins. The head of the camp is Morty, a clumsy but likeable leader. He hands Tripper a list of rules for the camp, which Trip promptly tears up and throws in a trash bin.At chow, the camp's gossip expert informs everyone that several romances are brewing or continuing among the counselors, much to their embarrassment. Rudy participates in his first ever soccer game and accidentally scores on his own goalie. He's ridiculed and stalks off hurt. He packs his things and walks to the nearby town to catch a bus home. Tripper shows up and talks to Rudy in a kind tone, telling him that he just needs to make a few friends and he'll have a great summer. If anyone gives him any trouble, Trip tells him to go directly to him.Rudy and Tripper become friends, Rudy joining him for morning runs and staying up late to play cards - Tripper is no match for the budding card shark in Rudy, who takes home nearly all the peanuts they'd been using for wagers. Seeing a few good character traits in Rudy, Tripper later puts him in charge of making the PA announcements while he takes the counselors-in-training (CITs) on an overnight trip. At the overnight, Tripper and the other head counselor, Roxanne, become closer, despite Tripper's previous unwanted advances.North Star heads over to Camp Mohawk for the annual basketball game. North Star has continually lost to the ringer athletes of Mohawk, who also cheat to win. With his team many points in the hole, Tripper tells them they can lose with self-respect: at the next tip-off, the North Star players yank the shorts of their rivals down to their ankles and run. Joined by the North Star spectators and Tripper, they make it to their bus and triumphantly race back to their camp, Tripper proclaiming ""This is the proudest day in North Star history!""Parent's Day arrives, with Morty, his bed and his nightstand hung from a tree near the camp's entrance as a prank by Tripper and his CITs. Rudy's father is unable to come to the event and he spends the day jogging with Tripper around the woods.The big event of the summer is the Olympiad that takes place between Mohawk and North Star. North Star has lost consistently to Mohawk for the past 13 years, primarily because they can't match the skill of the Mohawk athletes but also because Mohawk is notorious for cheating. Beating North Star at several events, Mohawk takes an early and seemingly insurmountable lead in points. When all hope seems lost, Tripper rallies everyone in the camp. North Star begins to cheat just as cleverly as Mohawk does and they begin a solid comeback, winning in a speed swimming event, a wrestling match, the sauce/teacup contest (won by the klutzy Spaz) and in the hot dog eating contest, where the chubby CIT Fink is able to beat Mohawk's champion, The Stomach, while Tripper frantically coaches him and massages his stomach.Morty announces that they're only 20 points behind Mohawk and can win with the final event, a short, cross-country run. Unfortunately, North Star's best runner, Jackie, was fouled during the field hockey game by two Mohawk players and is out with a broken ankle. Tripper volunteers Rudy, saying he's been running with him all summer and is in shape enough to win. Rudy immediately objects but Tripper tells him he has the utmost confidence in him. He tells him that he probably can't outrun Mohawk's runner on the open road but when the course enters the woods, he can outpace him because he's smaller and able to avoid a lot of the foliage.The run begins and Rudy paces his opponent steadily until they enter the woods. Rudy takes off, outdistancing his opponent, gaining a solid lead. When they hit the homestretch, Rudy is able to keep his lead and finishes the victor. The camp rallies to Rudy as the camp champion.
Tripper and Roxanne escort Rudy back to his cabin that night where Rudy is greeted heartily by his mates. Tripper takes the CITs to a final campfire where they all drink champagne to celebrate their victory with Morty. They all sing a song about the more rotten aspects of being camp counselors. Tripper talks to Roxanne about moving in with him back home. Roxanne says she'll join him.The next morning, everyone prepares to go home. Rudy is asked by one of his mates if he'd like to come to a camp his father is opening. Rudy turns him down, saying he'll return to North Star. Roxanne suggests they say goodbye to Morty: out on the lake, Morty has been placed on a raft with his bed and nightstand to drift until he wakes up. Tripper gathers everyone together for the ride out, taking Roxanne with him on his motorcycle.On the lake, Morty wakes up to find he's stranded while the credits roll."
Escape from Alcatraz,1979,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0079116/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Alcatraz is the most secure prison of its time. It is believed that no one can ever escape from it, until three daring men make a possibly successful attempt at escaping from one of the most infamous prisons in the world. The true story of three inmates who attempt a daring escape from the infamous prison, Alcatraz Island. Although no one had managed to escape before, bank robber Frank Morris (Clint Eastwood) masterminded this elaborately detailed, and, as far as anyone knows, ultimately successful, escape. In twenty-nine years, this seemingly impenetrable federal penitentiary, which housed Al Capone and ""Birdman"" Robert Stroud, was only broken once by three inmates who were never heard of again.—movetosquamish The true story of Frank Morris (Clint Eastwood), a cunning bank robber who was sent to Alcatraz Island, the most feared prison in the world. Although nobody had ever escaped from Alcatraz, Frank masterminded this elaborately detailed and, as far as anyone knows, ultimately successful, escape. In twenty-nine years, this seemingly impenetrable federal penitentiary, which housed Al Capone and ""Birdman"" Robert Stroud, was only broken once by three inmates, who were never heard of again.—Chris Makrozahopoulos <makzax@hotmail.com> On the night of 18 January 1960, convict Frank Morris (Clint Eastwood) enters the federal penitentiary at Alcatraz, an island fortress situated in San Francisco bay, California. After being strip-searched and given a dark blue prison uniform, Frank is escorted naked to his cell where one guard taunts him by saying ""Welcome to Alcatraz"". Soon after arriving, Frank is summoned to the office of the warden (Patrick McGoohan), who warns him that Alcatraz is unique within the U.S. prison system for its exceedingly high level of security. According to his file, Frank has an exceptional I.Q. and has absconded from other facilities, but the warden informs him that no inmate has ever successfully escaped from Alcatraz. During the conversation, the warden fails to notice that Frank has stolen one of the nail clippers on the desk.Over the next several days, Frank makes acquaintances with a few inmates. Among them are ""Litmus"" (Frank Ronzio), a lifer who keeps a pet mouse, ""English"" (Paul Benjamin), an African American man serving two consecutive 99 year sentences for a double murder and the prison librarian, and Chester ""Doc"" Dalton (Roberts Blossom), an elderly man who paints portraits and once grew chrysanthemums at Alcatraz. However, Frank also encounters a bully named Wolf (Bruce M. Fischer), who harasses him in the showers and later attacks him in the prison yard with a shank. The guards break up the fight, and both men are sent to solitary confinement cells in D block, despite Frank merely acting in self-defense.Two weeks later, after being released from the brutal, isolated conditions, Frank settles into the routine of Alcatraz and a job in the carpentry shop and running books for English from the library. English commands deep respect in the prison yard, sitting high above the other inmates. When Frank approaches, English's friends try to stop him but English unexpectedly permits him to sit with him.Frank also befriends a new inmate in the adjoining cell, Charley Butts (Larry Hankin), in on a grand-theft auto charge that became a federal rap when he crossed state lines with the car. When the warden enters Doc's cell unannounced, he sees that doc has painted a very detailed portrait of the warden. At first the warden appears flattered but later he cruelly orders Doc's painting privileges to be eliminated without explanation. Devastated, Doc intentionally chops off three of his fingers in the carpentry shop with a hatchet. Frank and the other inmates soon learn that the warden saw the portrait of himself among Doc's paintings and was responsible for ordering the sadistic penalty.In his cell one day, Frank sees a roach climb into the ventilator grill underneath the sink. Using the nail file he stole from the warden, he chips off a piece of the concrete around the opening. Along with brothers John and Clarence Anglin (Fred Ward and Jack Thibeau), who are Frank's friends from another prison sentence, and Charley, Frank plans an escape. Because the moist air and the salt water surrounding Alcatraz have softened the concrete foundation and corroded the metal over the last several decades, Frank thinks they can dig an opening around their ventilators large enough to crawl through and access the shaft leading to the roof.To mislead the guards during head counts, Frank suggests making papier-mâché dummy heads, using flesh-colored paint and hair from the barbershop. Since John works in the clothing shop, he can secure raincoats that can be combined with contact cement to make a raft and life preservers. Charley takes up painting to procure the colors needed to create the dummy heads and create cardboard coverings for the cell vents. Over the next several nights, as Charley keeps watch, Frank continues to scoop out his opening with the nail file and uses an accordion to disguise the hole. He later sneaks a spoon from the cafeteria and welds it to the file to provide a better grip for digging, a trick he learns from English using filings from a dime he gets from Litmus (who happily demands Frank's desserts at chow time).Using a wedge he sneaks from the carpentry shop, he is able to kick out the metal grill and takes his first peak into the shaft. Charley and the Anglins start to chisel their openings, while Frank creates his dummy head. When the decoy is finished, Frank lays the fake head on the cot as if he is sleeping and takes his first trip into the passageway. Initially the guard is fooled by the dummy, but later becomes suspicious when he notices that Frank has not moved. However, Frank miraculously returns to the cot before the decoy is exposed.The following day, Frank learns that the Anglin brothers are making progress on their openings and heads, but Charley is behind schedule. During the next trip into the passageway, John brings the raincoats and begins preparing the flotation devices. Meanwhile, Frank investigates the iron rods and hood blocking the exit to the roof and devises a makeshift drill from a small fan to remove their structural support. With the passageway clear and the rafts almost ready, Frank schedules the escape for Tuesday night, June 11, 1962.A few days later on the day of the planned escape, during mealtime, Frank places a chrysanthemum at the table in honor of Doc, but the warden stops by and crushes it, reminding Frank of regulations. Litmus is enraged, but as he reaches out to attack the warden, he suffers a fatal heart attack. Later, the warden requests a shakedown of Frank's cell and finds nothing unusual. However, when he hears that Frank and Charley stay up late conversing, he issues orders for the two inmates to be relocated to different cells as soon as possible. Meanwhile, Wolf has been released from solitary confinement and prepares to stab Frank with a knife, but English is able to intercept him.That night, Frank, John, Clarence and Charley plan to meet in the passageway and escape. However, Charley panics and fails to rendezvous with them. Carrying the flotation gear, Frank and the brothers access the roof and avoid the searchlights. From there, they scramble down the side of the building into the prison yard, climb over a barbed-wire fence and make their way to the shore of the island where they inflate the raft. The three men enter the water and begin kicking.The next day at dawn, a guard orders Frank to get up and prepare for relocation to a new cell. When there is no response, the guard slaps the head and it rolls on the floor. The alarm sounds and English smiles, knowing that Frank has escaped. As police search the area, there is no evidence to indicate whether or not the three inmates survived, but the warden does not want to blemish his perfect record and insists they drowned. On a rock by the shore, he finds a chrysanthemum and throws it in the water. The fates of Frank, Clarence and John are left unknown even after an extensive investigation by the FBI."

Now the drugs don't work, and as an eventful life filled with amphetamines, alcohol, and sex flashes before his eyes, Gideon converses with eerie Angelique. Scenes from his past life start to encroach on the present as he becomes increasingly aware of his own mortality. After all, Joe deserves to meet his doom. Isn't death the final curtain everyone must face?—Nick Riganas Joe Gideon (Roy Scheider) is a theater director and choreographer trying to balance staging his latest Broadway musical, ""NY/LA"", with editing a Hollywood film he has directed, ""The Stand-Up"". He is an alcoholic, a driven workaholic who chain-smokes cigarettes, and a womanizer who constantly flirts and has sex with a stream of women. Each morning, he starts his day by playing a tape of Vivaldi while taking doses of Visine, Alka-Seltzer and Dexedrine, always finishing by looking at himself in the mirror and telling himself ""It's showtime, folks!"". Joe's ex-wife, Audrey Paris (Leland Palmer), is involved with the production of the show, but disapproves of his womanizing ways. Meanwhile, his girlfriend Katie Jagger (Ann Reinking) and teenage daughter Michelle (Erzsebet Foldi) keep him company. In his imagination, he flirts with an angel of death called Angelique (Jessica Lange) in a nightclub setting, chatting with her about his life.As Joe continues to be dissatisfied with his editing job, repeatedly making minor changes to a single monologue, he takes his anger out on the dancers in his choreography, putting on a highly sexualized number with topless women during one rehearsal and frustrating both Audrey and the show's penny-pinching backers. The only moment of joy in his life occurs when Katie and Michelle perform a Fosse-style number for Joe as an homage to the upcoming release of ""The Stand-Up"", moving him into tears. During a particularly stressful table-read of ""NY/LA"", Joe experiences severe chest pains and is admitted to the hospital with severe angina. Joe disregards his symptoms, and attempts to leave to go back to rehearsal, but he collapses in the doctor's office and is ordered to remain in the hospital for several weeks to rest his heart and recover from his exhaustion. ""NY/LA"" is postponed, but Gideon continues his antics from the hospital bed, continuing to smoke and drink while having endless strings of women come through his room; as he does, his condition continues to deteriorate, despite Audrey and Katie both remaining by his side for support. A negative review for ""The Stand-Up"" (which has been released during Joe's time in the hospital) comes in despite the film's monetary success, and Gideon has a massive coronary event.As Joe undergoes coronary artery bypass surgery, the producers of ""NY/LA"" realize that the best way to recoup their money and make a profit is to wager on Gideon dying: the insurance proceeds which would bring in a profit of over a half a million dollars. As Gideon goes on life support, he directs extravagant dream sequences in his own head starring his ex-wife, girlfriend and daughter, who berate him for his behavior; he realizes he cannot avoid his own death and has another heart attack. As the doctors attempt to save him, Joe runs away from his hospital bed behind their backs and explorers the hospital's basement and the autopsy ward before he allows himself to be taken back. He goes through the five stages of death (anger, denial, bargaining, depression and acceptance) featured in the stand-up routine he has been editing, and as he gets closer to death, his dream sequences become more and more hallucinatory. As the doctors attempt one more time to save him, Joe imagines a monumental variety show featuring everyone from his past where he takes center stage in an extensive musical number (""Bye Bye Life""). In his dying dream, Joe is able to thank his family and acquaintances as he cannot from his hospital bed, and his performance receives a massive standing ovation. Joe finally dreams of himself traveling down a hallway to meet Angelique eventually, as the film abruptly cuts to his corpse being zipped up in a body bag."

Hysteria grips California in the wake of the bombing of Pearl Harbor. An assorted group of defenders attempt to make the coast defensible against an imagined Japanese invasion, in this big budget, big cast comedy.

The Japanese have bombed Pearl Harbour, bring the US into WW2. California may be the next target so US defence forces are mobilised to defend it. This creates a wave of paranoia and an army with weapons that far exceed their operators' skillsets. Turns out, however, that a Japanese submarine is planning to attack the US. Its target: Hollywood.—grantss Only six days after the attack on Pearl Harbor, the news that the Japanese are about to attack sunny California spreads like wildfire. Indeed, amid rampant paranoia, a Japanese submarine surfaces off the Californian coast, commanded by ambitious Commander Akiro Mitamura, who wants to destroy the lustrous symbol of America: Hollywood. However, a swift, battle-scarred Curtiss P-40K Warhawk fighter patrols the sky, and its brave United States Air Force pilot, Captain ""Wild Bill"" Kelso, is destined for glory.—Nick Riganas It's been six days since the attack on Pearl Harbor. Panic grips California, supposedly the next target of the Japanese forces. Everywhere in California, people are suffering from war nerves. Chaos erupts all over the state. An Army Air Corps Captain, a civilian with a deranged sense of Nationalism, civilian defenders, and a Motor Pool crew all end up on the trail of a lost Japanese sub that has picked Hollywood as their own target. Will these people be able to defend their homes? Will they be able to preserve the safety in California? Will they be able to get a hold of themselves?—David Rivera December 13, 1941. One week after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, and on a beach in northern California, a young woman, part of a 'Polar Bear' swim club, goes for a swim in the ocean alone and naked to only to find a Japanese submarine surfacing under her. She holds on to the periscope as it rises. The submarine is the I-19, and the sub commander Akiro Mitamura (Toshiro Mifune) with some of his crew arrive out on deck to survey the coastline. Accompanying them is a hard-line German naval captain named Wolfgang von Kleinschmidt (Christopher Lee). Commander Mitamura tells Von Kleinschmidt that he has crossed the Pacific Ocean with the intent to destroy something honorable on the U.S. West Coast since missing the other activities the Japanese Navy has done in the past week. The bickering German officer agrees and suggests that they travel south along the coast to a place called Hollywood located on their chart map and hope to evade detection. As the submarine prepares to submerge, a Japanese crew member looks up at the naked girl clinging to the periscope, and yells: ""Hollywood! Hollywood!"" At this point, the submarine crew realizes they have arrived where they intended to be, and the vessel submerges once again while the girl swims to safety.Meanwhile in Los Angeles, dishwasher Wally Stephens (Bobby Di Cicco) tells his co-worker Dennis Desoto (Perry Lang) about his plans to enter a dance contest with his ex-girlfriend Betty Douglas (Dianne Kay), against her father's wishes. Tank crew chief Sgt. Frank Tree (Dan Aykroyd), along with his crew Private Foley (John Candy), Private Reese (Mickey Rourke), Private Hinshaw (Walter Olkewicz), and Corporal Sitarski (Treat Williams) are also at Wally's restaurant having breakfast. Sitarski takes an instant dislike to Wally after they meet when Wally serves him some coffee and a scuffle breaks out as Sitarski used to be a police officer before he was drafted and recognizes Wally who served time in a juvenile hall for auto theft. The fight is broken up by Sgt. Tree who takes his men out of the diner. Wally tries to persuade his boss to let them have the night off, but when his boss refuses and Willy keeps badgering him for the night off, both Wally and Dennis get fired from their jobs.Across town, Betty Douglas, along with her friend Maxine (Wendie Jo Sperber) are in training as taxi girl dancer for an upcoming USO show at the local nightclub that has been taken over under the tutelage of USO liaison Mrs. Fitzroy. Wally and Dennis go to a local department store where Wally tries on a zoot suit to wear and seeing that he doesn't have the money to pay for it, he has Dennis sound an air raid siren in the store. In the resulting panic, Wally walks out of the department store wearing the zoot suit, while Dennis has a run-in with two attractive looking twin ladies whom he pretends to help them out.Meanwhile somewhere in Death Valley California at 12 noon, Captain Wild Bill Kelso (John Belushi), a manic US Army Air Force officer lands his stolen Curtis P-40 fighter to refuel at a local gas station where he claims to the gas matron and the patrons that he's tracking a Japanese air squadron. But when he takes off after his plane is re-fulled, he accidentally blows up the gasoline station when he drops his lighted cigar.Back in Los Angeles, the stuffy Major General Joseph Stilwell (Robert Stack) attempts to bring order to the hysteria and insanity gripping the region, while the general's new secretary Donna Stratten (Nancy Allen) as well as his assistant Captain Loomis Birkhead (Tim Matheson) have other ideas. Birkhead takes an instant liking to Donna and after learning from a colleague that Donna will only respond when she is aboard an airborne plane. At a nearby airbase, while General Stilwell gives a press conference about the impossibility of the Japanese bombing Los Angeles, Birkhead approaches Donna and takes her into the cockpit of a nearby B-17 bomber where he attempts to seduce her by simulating the plane taking off and flying. But Donna stops him by saying that it's not the same thing as being airborne and will only respond to his sexual advances in a real airborne plane. When Birkhead refuses to back away from her, she punches him, he falls back and accidentally releases a bomb door lever in which a large bomb drops out and rolls towards General Stilwell and the press conference and a panic ensues when the rolling bomb hits the stand and detonates. But all the people run to safety before it explodes.At the Douglas family home on the coast, Wally arrives to meet with Betty in his newly stolen zoot suit to ask her out, but she tells him that the club has been taken over by the USO and is accessible only to servicemen. Wally is confronted by Mr. Douglas (Ned Beatty) and his wife Joan (Lorraine Gary), where it's revealed that they are still angry at Wally since he stole and previously destroyed their car during a date he had over one year ago with Betty which landed him in jail. Betty and Maxine fall into a pit which was dug by Mr. Douglas three obnoxious and bratty younger sons whom have also gotten caught up in the war hysteria. Soon after, Sgt. Tree and the tank crew arrive to deliver a large AA gun to the Douglas property, where Corporal Sitarski also spots Betty and takes a liking to her as well. However, Maxine also spots Sitarski and takes a liking to him too, which he declines the overweight lady's offer to attend the USO show with her. When Wally attempts to persuade Betty to accompany him to the dance anyway, Sitarski and the tank crew beat up Wally and throw him in the back of a passing garbage truck.Nearby, at the home of Mr. Douglas neighbor Angelo Scioli (Lionel Stander), he has built an armored car against the protest of his nagging wife. Angelo, a former serviceman having joined the Civil Defense Force, persuades his friend Claude Crumn (Murray Hamilton) to take his friend Herbie (Eddie Deezen) to perch themselves atop a Ferris wheel at a local Santa Monica pier that Angelo owns to be air raid spotters. With rifles in hand as well as binoculars, and a telephone, Angelo puts them in on one of the Ferris wheel carts and moves the wheel to the top where Claude and Herbie will spend all day to look for approaching Japanese planes. Claude and Herbie do not get along at all because of Herbie's nagging and eccentricity, which makes matters worse when Herbie brings along a ventriquilist dummy with them where he also talks though the obnoxious and ratting dummy.Meanwhile, Japanese submarine becomes lost trying to find Los Angeles when the ship's compass is broken. Commander Mitamura sends a landing party ashore where they capture a local timber merchant, Hollis ""Holly"" Wood (Slim Pickens). Despite the language barrier, since none of the Japanese crew, nor Von Kleinschmidt speak any English, Hollis knows that he's a prisoner, but he also slow to understand of their destination. Upon a search of his belongings, one Japanese crewman discovers a small compass in a box of Cracker Jacks that he has. But Wood grabs and swallows the small compass rather than let it fall into the hands of the Japanese. The Japanese spend several hours torturing him by forcing him to drink prune juice to make him defecate the compass. But Wood manages to turn the tables on his captors where he manages to escape and swim ashore.In Los Angeles at nightfall, Wally arrives at the nightclub where he and several Latino zoot suit members are kept out of the nightclub by the military guards posted there. Just then, Sitarski arrives with Betty as his date and forces the guards to keep Wally and the rest of the zoot suits out. When Wally sees Dennis dressed as a sailor with the twin ladies at his side going into the USO club, he gets an idea. Wally knocks out a Shoreman Patrol officer, steals his uniform, and gains access to the nightclub where he tries to get Betty's attention by bringing her onto the dance floor. But a while dancing up a storm with Betty, gaining the attention of the MC as well as a Hollywood talent agent, a huge brawl erupts when Sitarski begins a fight with Wally, and the underwear clad Shore Patrol officer arrives which leads to a huge riot out on the streets.When Captain Birkhead learns from General Stilwell about the renegade Colonel ""Madman"" Maddox (Warren Oates) isolating himself at the Barstow Air Force base and having airplanes, he gets the idea of going there with Donna and stealing a plane to fly and to seduce Donna. While Stilwell goes to the local theater to watch the feature film 'Dumbo', Birkhead and Donna drive to the Barstow airbase where they nearly get shot by the lunatic Maddox's solders whom he has told that every person approaching the base is a Japanese. But both Birkhead and Donna are disappointed when Colonel Maddox tells them that he has no bombers or fighter planes at the base, only an old C-47 transport plane, which Birkhead is happy to take on the ruse that he intends to fly over Los Angeles to spot any Japanese airplanes. But when Birkhead and Donna manage to take off, they realize that the plane they are flying in does not have a radio and they have no way of contacting anyone on the ground.Shortly afterwards, Wild Bill arrives with his P-40 to refuel and learns from the insane Maddox about spoting Japanese planes all over the place. As Wild Bill prepares to take off again, Maddox asks him to fire the guns from his plane just to listen to the gunfire. Wild Bill does, and in so doing, shoots up part of the airbase's buildings, and also cutting the telephone lines, which now means that Maddox and his men have no way of contacting Civil Defense in Los Angeles to inform them about Birkhead and Donna's airborne plane, or of Wild Bill's plane as well.Back in Los Angeles, the riot between the Army soldiers, Marines, sailors, and zoot suit guys is getting worse when Sgt Tree arrives in his tank with his crew, along with the latest addition, the Negro Private Ogden Johnson Jones (Frank McRae) to disrupt the riot and he gives a speech to the rioters about them turning against each other in this time of war. Just then, Los Angeles goes to Red Alert when the Civil Defense radar stations spot an ""unknown aircraft"" in the air. As Birkhead and Donna fly over Los Angeles just as he finally begins to seduce her, civil defense AA batteries open fire at their plane. The chaos continues as Wild Bill flies in and joins in the chase. Wild Bill manages to hit Birkhead and Donna's plane which crash lands into the La Brea Tar Pits area.Meanwhile, Ward Douglas spots the Japanese submarine lurking off shore near his home and decides to use the AA gun left behind by Sgt. Tree to fire at it. On top of the Ferris wheel, Claude and Herbie also spot the submarine, but they accidentally drop their telephone to the ground and have no way to contact anyone. So they open fire on it with their rifles, keeping the Japanese crewmen pinned down and creating some panic for them. But Claude and Herbie accidentally shoot at Wild Bill's plane that flies overhead after mistaking it for a Japanese Zero fighter. Wild Bill's plane comes crashing to the ground at Hollywood Boulevard where he gets out and tells everyone about spotting a Japanese submarine off shore. Wally hears this and when Sgt. Tree accidentally hits his head, Wally, with Betty in tow, commandeers the tank and rides off to where Wild Bill told them about the sub's location. Left behind, Sitarski and Maxine hitch a ride with Wild Bill riding on a motorcycle and a chase through the streets begins with Wally riding the tank over a few cars and even shooting up a policeman's car after recognizing the officer as the man who arrested him. The tank crashes though a paint factory and then a turpentine factory.Meanwhile, Ward Douglas begins firing at the Japanese submarine, but destroys his house in the progress with his bad aim. When Angelo sends one of Ward's sons to the pier to rescue Claude and Herbie stuck in the Ferris wheel, the brat accidentally turns on the entire lights for the amusement park..... illuminating it for the I-19 Japanese submarine. ""Fire at the industrial structure!"" yells Mitamuro. The I-19 begins shelling the amusement park, not realizing its little-use potential. The Ferris wheel is hit which rolls down the pier and into the water. Claude and Herbie (as well as the dummy) manage to swim ashore. But the nervous and bickering Captain von Kleinschmidt has had enough and wants to submerge, and he draws a gun on Mitamuro. But Mitamuro overpowers the German officer and throws him overboard. Kleinschmidt manages to swim ashore where he is later captured by Hollis Wood himself (the only U.S. ""victory"" of the movie).When Wally and the tank crew arrive at the amusement park and drive onto the pier to open fire on the I-19. The Japanese sub turns toward the shore and fires a torpedo at the pier, destroying it and sending the tank and all its occupants into the water. Wild Bill drives his stolen motorbike onto the pier just as it collapses into the water. Deranged to the last, Wild Bill swims to the submarine and boards where he is captured by the crew. Commander Mitamuro, believing that his honorable mission has been accomplished, orders his crew to submerge and return home with their prisoner of war Wild Bill, who undaunted, he declares, ""Turn this tub around! You're takin' me to Tokyo!""The following morning on Sunday December 14, General Stilwell arrives at the devastated Douglas home where he is informed by Sgt. Tree, Wally, Betty, Claude, Herbie, Dennis, plus the entire tank crew about their harrowing experiences the night before. Also in custody with Stilwell's men is Birkhead and Donna, as well as Sitarski and Maxine, as well as the captive Captain von Kleinschmidt with his former captive-turned-captor Hollis Wood, and Colonel Maddox in a straightjacket on his way to the local funny farm. Ward delivers a short and inspirational speech to those present, vowing that Christmas will not be ruined; to punctuate his point, he nails a wreath to his front door, jarring the unstable house so that it collapses and slides into the ocean. The amused Stilwell mutters, ""It's gonna be a long war,"" and walks away as everyone begins arguing and fighting in front of the foundations of the destroyed Douglas home."

Now, as unpaid bills and debts start piling up, Billy has no other choice but to return to the ring and win the most important fight in his career.

J. Considering a comeback after seven years away from the sport, Billy returns to the Ninth Street Gym for a meeting with manager Charlie Goodman and brings along T. J., who is thrilled that his father, whom he idolizes and calls ""Champ,"" might fight again. At the gym, Billy is still revered as a boxer, and Georgie, a training assistant, has saved Billy's old gloves. However, Billy feels disrespected when Goodman keeps him waiting, and shouts that he will return in thirty minutes, leaving his son at the gym. Later, T. J. finds his father drunk at a bar and helps him home. In the middle of the night, Billy steals $20 dollars from T. J.'s piggy bank and drives to a casino.

Being There,1979,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078841/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"After the death of his employer forces him out of the only home he's ever known, a simpleminded, sheltered gardener becomes an unlikely trusted advisor to a powerful tycoon and an insider in Washington politics. Simple-minded gardener Chance has spent all his life in the Washington D.C. home of an old man. When the man dies, Chance is put out on the street with no knowledge of the world except what he has learned from television. After a run-in with a limousine, he ends up a guest of Eve and her husband Ben, an influential but sickly businessman. Now called Chauncey Gardner, Chance becomes friend and confidante to Ben, and an unlikely political insider.—Scott Renshaw <as.idc@forsythe.stanford.edu> Chance is mentally challenged, those that know him who would probably call him simple. He doesn't know how to read or write. For as long as he can remember, he has worked as the gardener for his long time employer Mr. Jennings, has never stepped off the property of Jennings' brownstone in Washington DC, has only known Jennings and the only other household servant, a maid/cook named Louise who tends to all his meals, and has only had contact to the outside world indirectly via television, the channels on which he is frequently changing as he watches. Conversely, no one but Jennings and Louise know that he lives there. He only fully understands the world of his garden, all else, including what he sees on TV, he not comprehending in their entirety. His wardrobe consists largely of Jennings' discarded but well appointed clothes. After Jennings dies, Chance is sent ""into the world"" not truly understanding what his new situation means. By chance, he eventually meets wealthy Eve Rand, who, out of circumstance, invites him to her and much older ill husband's house. Her husband, Ben Rand, is a financier, who will probably imminently pass from his aplastic anemia. Not fully comprehending what Chance is truly saying, they believe his name to be Chauncey Gardner, and that he is a man of wealth and straightforward deep insight. As such, they introduce him to their rich and powerful friends - some very rich and extremely powerful - who believe, largely because Ben Rand says so, that Chauncey is brilliant in a down home way, his brilliance which they state in public. The question then becomes whether anyone will notice that the emperor has no clothes (to use an old adage), even after background checks on ""Chauncey Gardner"" come up empty and especially if their public praise of him has gone too far to go back.—Huggo Chance (Peter Sellers) is a middle-aged gardener who lives in the townhouse of a wealthy man in Washington D.C. Chance seems very simple-minded and has lived in the house his entire life, tending the garden, with virtually no contact with the outside world. His cultural and social education is derived entirely from what he watches on the television sets provided by the ""Old Man,"" who raised him. The only other person in his life is Louise, the maid who cooks his meals and looks upon him as nothing more than a child who has failed to grow up. When his benefactor dies, Chance is visited by attorneys handling the estate. Chance tells them that he has lived his whole life inside the house. He was apparently abandoned as a baby and left in a basket outside the front door where the ""Old Man"" lived, who took him in and raised him. The lawyers force him to leave the townhouse and he discovers the outside world for the first time.Chance wanders aimlessly through a wintry and busy Washington dressed in conservative, old-fashioned business attire, a homburg hat, suitcase, umbrella and a television remote from his former home. Although finely-tailored many years ago, his clothes are of the style which has now come back into fashion, and so others presume he is an expensively well-dressed man of means.That evening, as he wanders, Chance happens upon a TV store. He sees his own image in one of the TVs captured by a camera in the shop window. While watching himself he backs into the street and is struck by a car owned by Ben Rand (Melvyn Douglas), a wealthy businessman. Rand's wife Eve (Shirley MacLaine), who is inside the limo, invites Chance to their home to recover from his injured leg. After being offered alcohol for the first time in his life, Chance coughs after he is asked his name. He says, ""Chance the Gardener"", but due to his cough those listening interpret his name to be ""Chauncey Gardiner.""During dinner at the Rands' home, Chance describes the attorneys coming to his former house and shutting it down where he lived his whole life after the death of ""the Old Man"". Judging by his appearance and overall demeanor, Ben Rand automatically assumes that Chauncey is an upper class, well-to-do, highly-educated business man. Although Chance is really describing being kicked out of the home where he tended to the garden after the death of his legal guardian, Ben Rand perceives it as attorneys shutting down Chance's business because of financial problems after the death of his long-term boss and mentor ""the Old Man"".Ben even assumes it must have been caused by ""kid lawyers from the SEC,"" obviously attributing it to have occurred at a higher, more sophisticated level than a tax/IRS problem, as most persons would likely have assumed. Sympathizing with him, Ben Rand takes Chance under his wing. Chance's personal style and seemingly conservative and insightful ways embody many qualities that Ben admires. His simplistic, serious-sounding utterances, which mostly concern the garden, are interpreted by virtually everyone as allegorical statements of deep wisdom and knowledge regarding business matters and the current state of the economy in America.Ben Rand is also the confidant and adviser of the U.S. President (Jack Warden), whom he introduces to ""Chauncey."" Chance's remarks about how the garden changes with the seasons are interpreted by the President as economic and political advice, relating to his concerns about the mid-term unpopularity that many administrations face while in office. Chance, as Chauncey Gardiner, quickly rises to national public attention. He becomes a media celebrity and appears on a national television talk show. He rapidly joins the A-list of the most wanted in Washington society. Public opinion polls start to reflect just how much his ""simple brand of wisdom"" resonates with the jaded American public. At an upscale Washington cocktail lounge, two important, older, well-dressed men are discussing Chauncey; one says to the other, there is a rumor ""he holds degrees in medicine as well as law."" Rand, dying of aplastic anemia, encourages his wife to become close to Chance, knowing Eve is a fragile woman.Rand's doctor (Richard A. Dysart) makes a few inquiries of his own. Even after acquiring Chance's fingerprints and a photo of him, the physician can't find a record of him anywhere, including elementary, middle, or high schools, colleges, nor employment or a police record. Rand's doctor concludes that Chance is actually a simpleton gardener, totally oblivious and unaware to the ways of the world. But he sees that Chance has helped Rand to accept his final illness and pending death. The doctor is hesitant to say anything that will upset Rand.

Going in Style,1979,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0079219/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Three friends living on the dole decide to rob a bank. Joe, Al, and Willie are three old men who have resigned themselves to dying. One night, Joe hatches a scheme to put a bit of excitement back into their lives: robbing a bank.—Murray Chapman <muzzle@cs.uq.oz.au> Joe (George Burns), Al (Art Carney), and Willie (Lee Strasberg) are three senior citizens who share a small apartment in Astoria, Queens, New York City. They are three retirees who live off monthly social security checks and spend their summer days sitting on a bench in a nearby park, reading newspapers, feeding pigeons, and fending off obnoxious children.It is a dull life, and finally Joe is driven to suggest something radical to break the monotony. After making their monthly visit to their bank to cash and/or deposit their social security checks, out of the blue Joe asks them: ""why not go on a stick-up?"" Bored by their daily routine, Joe argues that the crime is not as risky as they may think. In the unlikely event that they are arrested, room and board will be free in prison and their social security checks will accumulate until they are released; and if they succeed, they will have extra cash to enjoy, instead of sitting on a park bench all day. Al likes the idea, but Willie is more skeptical. As they discuss details, Al offers to investigate the gun collection of his nephew, Pete, while Joe proposes that they scout a bank to rob in New York City.Al surreptitiously borrows some pistols from the collection of his nephew, Pete (Charles Hallahan) who lives just a few miles away with his wife and three obnoxious children, and whom are having money problems themselves. Pete tells Al that he wants to open up his own furniture store, but the stress of paying for their mortgage as well as utility bills is getting to all of them. Al decides to himself that the bank robbery will help his nephew out financially.The next day, the three men take the subway into the city and, without much deliberation, decide to hold up the Union Marine Bank at 36th Street and Broadway. As they indulge in hot dogs from a street vendor and participate in a sidewalk drum performance, the men are rejuvenated by the scheme. Al is confident that he can obtain the guns that afternoon, so the ringleader, Joe, suggests robbing the bank the next day.While Joe and Willie purchase three pairs of Groucho Marx-style glasses as disguises, Al stops by Pete's house. As soon as his nephew leaves for work, Al sneaks into the basement and takes three pistols from the gun case, as well as an assortment of bullets. The next morning, after finally determining which bullets fit the pistols, the threesome take a bus to another neighborhood in Queens to conceal their point of origin. From there, they hail an unlicensed cab, which does not keep records of fares. For $30, the driver agrees to take them into Manhattan and to wait outside the bank while they ""sign a will."" Upon entering the bank in disguise, Al detains the security guard at gunpoint, as Joe orders the teller to hand over the money. When the bank manager does not take the elderly men seriously, Joe fires a bullet at the wall, causing everyone to take cover on the floor. After filling their satchel with cash, the friends dash back to the waiting cab, ask the driver to drop them at a subway station and return to Queens on the train.When they count the money at home, the total amounts to just over $35,000, and Al suggest they hide the loot in his old suitcase, stored at Pete's house. Later, as the three men sit on their regular park bench and overhear a report on the radio about the crime, Willie suffers a heart attack and dies. Sparing no expense, Joe makes funeral arrangements.During the memorial service, Joe and Al decide to give $25,000 of the heist money to Pete, who tirelessly works two jobs to support his family. Pete is speechless as Joe explains that he and Al inherited a $25,000 life insurance policy from Willie, but they have no need for the money. In exchange for the gift, Joe suggests that Pete give them $20 per week to supplement their fixed income. After the funeral, the two friends decide to spend some of their money on a spontaneous vacation to Las Vegas, Nevada. Without making reservations, they take a cab to Kennedy Airport, buy a ticket, and board their first plane flight.At a casino hotel that evening, they try their luck at the craps table. Al is not familiar with the game, but Joe instructs him to simply roll the dice while he places bets. To their surprise, they accumulate $73,000 in winnings by the end of the evening. However, Joe realizes that their gambling luck will make them a target for thieves, as well as more conspicuous to authorities, so he suggests they collect the cash and fly back to New York that night.Arriving at their apartment exhausted from the whirlwind excursion, they immediately fall asleep. When Joe wakes, he hears a report on the radio that the police anticipate a development in the ""amateur"" bank robbery case. Joe tries to wake Al with the news, but is distressed to find that his friend has passed away. A few hours later that evening, Joe arrives at Pete's house, carrying the bag of money, and takes Pete aside to divulge the bank robbery, the Vegas winnings and his uncle's death. He adds that the police appear to be closing in and asks Pete to help hide the approximately $107,000 in a safety deposit box. Tearful over his uncle's death, Pete agrees and promises not to inform the authorities.The next day, Joe shaves and dresses for Al's funeral, but as he leaves the apartment, two FBI agents handcuff him and take him away. During questioning, Joe refuses to reveal the location of the money.Sometime later, Pete visits Joe at the state prison and reminds him that if he does not give back the robbery cash, he will receive a harsher sentence. Joe says he does not mind, adding that Al and Willie would not want him to return the loot. Joe explains that it no longer matters to him if he remains in prison for the rest of his life. For several years, Joe already felt like he was in prison with living a dull life. Joe explains that he no longer has to cook and clean for himself in prison. He gets three square meals a day, and generally is getting ""treated like a king around here."" Joe tells Pete not to visit him again to avoid being suspected in his bank robbery plan, and to ""enjoy his inheritance"" of living off the bank robbery and Vegas money. In the final shot, as Joe is being escorted back to his cell by a guard, he looks mischievously at Pete and says with a wiry smile: ""besides... no tin-horn joint like this could ever hold me!"""

Caligula,1979,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080491/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A dramatization of the ascent to Caesar and subsequent reign of Caligula, one of the most notorious leaders of ancient Rome. We see his ambition, his scheming, his perversion and decadence, his brutality and his lunacy. Pagan Rome, 37 A.D. With the reign of the frail, syphilis-ridden, and half-mad Emperor Tiberius drawing to a close, Prince Gaius Augustus Germanicus, aka Caligula, arrives at the demented ruler's palace of sin on the island of Capri. And after the murder of the bedridden Tiberius, Caligula becomes the new emperor. Then, Caligula proclaims Julia Drusilla, his beloved sister and lover, as his equal, much to the disgust of the Roman Senate. And as the dangerous megalomaniac Caligula declares himself a god, he begins a four-year reign of depravity and terror, betraying allegiances, destroying virginities, and weeding out the competition through torture and execution. However, how much longer can the Roman Empire tolerate the insane tyrant's uncontrollable mania?—Nick Riganas A dramatization of the ascent to Caesar and subsequent reign of Caligula, one of the most notorious leaders of ancient Rome. We see his ambition, his scheming, his perversion and decadence, his brutality and his lunacy and how this impacts the people around him and the empire he leads.—grantss The rise and fall of the notorious Roman Emperor Caligula, showing the violent methods that he employs to gain the throne, and the subsequent insanity of his reign. He gives his horse political office and humiliates and executes anyone who even slightly displeases him. He also sleeps with his sister Drusilla, organizes elaborate orgies, and embarks on a fruitless invasion of Britain before meeting an appropriate end. There are various versions of this movie, ranging from the heavily-truncated 90-minute version to the legendary 2-hour-40-minute hardcore version which leaves nothing to the imagination--though the hardcore scenes were inserted later and did not involve the main cast members.—Michael Brooke <michael@everyman.demon.co.uk> The perversion behind Imperial Rome and the epic story of its maddest Emperor. All the details of Caligula's (Malcolm McDowell) cruel, bizarre reign are revealed right here: his unholy sexual passion for his sister, his marriage to Rome's most infamous prostitute, his fiendishly inventive means of disposing those who would oppose him, and more.—Shawn Ashley Pagan Rome, 37 A.D.Prince Gaius Germanicus ""Caligula"" (Latin term for 'Little Boots') (Malcolm McDowell) the 24-year-old young heir to the throne of the syphilis-ridden, 77-year-old, half-mad Emperor Tiberius (Peter O'Toole), thinks he has received a bad omen after a blackbird flies into his room early one morning. Shortly afterward, Macro (Guido Mannari), the head of the Praetorian Guards, appears to tell the young man that his great uncle (Tiberius) demands that he report at once to the Island of Capri, where he has been residing for a number of years with close friend, Senator Nerva (John Gielgud), Claudius (Giancaro Badessi), a dim-witted relative, and Caligula's younger stepbrother, Gemellus (Bruno Brive), Tiberius' favorite. Fearing assassination, Caligula is afraid to leave, but his beloved sister Drusilla (Teresa Ann Savoy) convinces him to go. Macro seeks to curry favor with Caligula, who will be the next Emperor, by tempting him with the promise of sleeping with his wife Ennia (Adriana Asti).At Capri, Caligula finds his uncle has become depraved, showing signs of advanced venereal diseases, and embittered with Rome and politics. Tiberius enjoys watching degrading sexual shows, often including children and various freaks of nature in his underground grotto. Caligula observes with a mixture of fascination and horror. Tiberius demands his grandson perform a dance from his youth when he was a mascot in his father's army. At first, Caligula claims to have forgotten, but Tiberius angrily insists. After a few minutes, Tiberius interrupts, and confronts Caligula about gossiping and praying for his grandfather's death. Caligula denies the accusations. Soon, Tiberius warns Nerva to be wary of Macro after his death. Tiberius embraces Caligula, and cautions him that it is a myth that emperors are gods. Tiberius is curious to know if he is missed in Rome, and Caligula assures him that he is loved. Tiberius believes he is not loved but feared. He cautions Caligula that every senator aspires to be emperor, and therefore is a traitor. Caligula denies being intimate with Drusilla, but Tiberius warns him that he knows everything that goes on in the kingdom. Soon, Tiberius greets Gemellus with affection. He offers Caligula a cup of wine, but Caligula passes the cup to Gemellus. However, Tiberius stops Gemellus from drinking, and warns him that Caligula will kill him once Tiberius is dead. A servant drinks the poisoned cup of wine and quickly dies.Later, Caligula wakes from a nightmare, and tells Drusilla that Tiberius plots to kill him, but she reassures him he is the only one who can be emperor because Gemellus is too young to rule and Uncle Claudius is not mentally fit. Caligula wants Drusilla to be his empress, but she reminds him that he has been promised to Macro's wife, Ennia. Even Macro agrees with the arrangement.Meanwhile, Nerva chooses suicide over a natural death by slashing his wrists in a bath. Tiberius discovers Nerva in the midst of his suicide. As Tiberius orders his wounds bound, Nerva admits that he hates his life. Tiberius says he cannot live without Nerva at his side, and promises to kill Macro, but even with Macro gone, Nerva does not want to be ruled by ""the reptile"" Caligula. Nerva begs to be allowed to die, and Tiberius leaves. Meanwhile, Caligula wants to know what dying is like, and asks Nerva if he can see the goddess Isis. When he cannot, Caligula believes he is lying, pushes him down in the tub, and hastens his death.Nerva's death hastens Tiberius' own when he soon collapses from an apparent stroke and is bedridden. Late one night, Macro escorts all the spectators out of the ailing Tiberius' bedchamber to allow Caligula the opportunity to murder his grandfather, but when Caligula fails and falls into an epileptic trance, Macro finishes the deed himself by strangling Tiberius with a scarf. Caligula triumphantly removes the imperial signet from Tiberius' finger and suddenly realizes that Gemellus has witnessed the murder.Back in Rome several days later, Tiberius is buried with honors and Caligula is proclaimed the new Emperor, who in turn proclaims Drusilla his equal, to the apparent disgust of the Roman Senate. Afterward, Drusilla, fearful of Macro's influence, convinces Caligula to get rid of him. Caligula obliges by setting up a mock trial, in which Gemellus is intimidated into testifying that Macro alone murdered Tiberius. Caligula then has Macro's wife, Ennia, arrested for ""insubordination"" and has her exiled to Gaul, never to be seen or heard from again.Macro is then executed in Caligula's public courtyard by a large decapitation machine; Macro and other convicts are buried up to their necks in the earth ground, and the blade-slashing machine, standing over 100-feet tall and wide as a city block, runs over him. At one point Caligula, when booed by the crowd, mutters ""If only all of Rome had but one neck...""With the powerful Macro gone, Caligula appoints Tiberius' former financial and political adviser Longinus (John Steiner) as his new adviser and right-hand man, and pronounces the docile Senator Chaerea (Paolo Bonacelli) as the new head of the Praetorian Guard. Drusilla endeavors to find Caligula a wife amongst the priestesses of the goddess Isis, the mystery cult they secretly practice. Disguised as a woman, Caligula chooses a candidate from among the shapely priestesses in the Temple of Isis. He is attracted, despite Drusilla's protests that she is promiscuous, to Caesonia (Helen Mirren), an eloquent, sensual divorcee, who becomes his mistress.Over the next several months, Caligula proves to be a popular, yet eccentric ruler, cutting taxes and overturning all the oppressive laws that Tiberius enacted. One of Caligula's first duties is to settle a land dispute between two senators. Instead of listening to arguments, he makes an arbitrary decision based on the size of the legal documents. Within a few months, the Roman Senate begins to dislike the young emperor for his eccentricities and various insults directed towards them. Darker aspects of his personality begin to emerge as well. When Caligula eyes a young woman named Livia (Mirella D'Angelo), whom is engaged to Proculus (Donato Placido), one of his most loyal soldiers, Caligula and his entourage crash Livia and Proculus wedding party where he lures both to the kitchen and rapes both of them in a minor fit of jealousy. Proculus is later disemboweled and castrated in a gory torture-murder by Caligula himself. When asked why he murdered one of his most loyal officers, Caligula's insane reply is: ""because I can.""The much darker side of Caligula begins to show itself as he comes to realize that no one will challenge his absolute power. His terror during a thunder and lightning rainstorm is the first sign of a mental breakdown; his reaction is to run outside and dance naked. As Drusilla is summoned, Caligula tells her that he knows Gemellus plots to kill him. She kisses away his fears, and soon, Caligula is making love to both Drusilla and Caesonia. In another bedchamber, two Isis women, Messalina and Agrippina, watch the threesome unfolding and then engage in lesbian sex with each other.A few more months later, Caligula's actions become increasingly senseless. His only confidant is his Arab stallion, Incitatus, which he rides into a banquet where Gemellus is one of the guests. In a macabre mood, Caligula accuses Gemellus publicly of treason and has him arrested merely to provoke a reaction from Drusilla. Caligula defends his increasingly erratic and outspoken actions as he is the Emperor of the Roman Empire and he feels that he can do anything he wants with impunity.After he discovers Caesonia is pregnant, Caligula suffers a severe fever, but Drusilla nurses him back to health. Right after he recovers, Caesonia bears Caligula a daughter, whom they name Julia Drusilla, and Caligula marries her on the spot. He is enraged to learn the child is a girl and insists on calling her ""my son."" During the celebration, Drusilla collapses in Caligula's arms from the same fever he'd suffered. Soon afterward, Caligula receives another ill omen in the guise of a black bird. He rushes to Drusilla's side and watches her die. Caligula experiences a nervous breakdown, smashes a statue of Isis and drags Drusilla's nude body around the palace while screaming hysterically.Now in a deep depression, Caligula walks the Roman streets, disguised as a beggar. When Caligula is dragged drunk and dirty into a prison for causing a disturbance at an outdoor theater, his signet ring is spotted by a giant (Osiride Pevarello) and his true identity becomes known. Caligula is released and has the Giant become his companion and 'flunky'.After his brief stay in jail, Caligula becomes determined to destroy the senatorial class, which he has come to loathe. Over the next year, his reign becomes a series of humiliations against the foundations of Rome. He orders the execution of several senators and their families without the slightest provocation.Caligula officially proclaims himself a god and awards free games and food to every citizen for one month. When Longinus protests by saying that the economy will never be able to handle such an expense, Caligula shows him how easy it is to replenish the Imperial purse. He builds a large ship in the palace that is to be used as a brothel. Forcing the wives and daughters of his senators into prostitution, Caligula himself collects the fees from citizens eager to sample their betters.Afterward, estates are confiscated, the old pagan religion is desecrated, and Caligula initiates an absurd war on Britain to humiliate the army. Caligula orders his officers to attack papyrus growing in the water of a lake so he can claim to have conquered Britain. Back in court, he announces his victory while servants parade the captured papyrus. During a celebration, Caligula orders Longinus to recite a list of citizens who have failed the empire, and they are arrested. His final public act of madness is to proclaim his horse, Incitatus, a senator.Having overruled every branch of the government, mocked the Roman gods, humiliated and killed all of the most loyal and trusted members of the Senate, destiny finally catches up with Caligula; Chaerea, Longinus, the Imperial physician Charicles (Leopoldo Trieste), the Chief Executioner, the Roman High Priest, and a few other senators and members of the Praetorian Guard have quietly begun plotting his assassination.On the last night of his life, Caligula wanders into his bedroom where a nervous Caesonia awaits him. The black bird makes a final appearance, but only Caesonia is frightened of it. By this point, Caligula is so consumed by his insanity that he no longer exhibits fear or any kind of strong emotions.The next day, on a cold January morning in 41 A.D., after rehearsing an Egyptian play, Caligula and his family leave the stadium to return to the Imperial Palace. On their way back, a vengeful Chaerea awaits them in the front corridor. After Caligula teases Chaerea one final time by giving him the secret password ""scrotum"", Chaerea answers, ""So be it!""..... he draws his sword and strikes Caligula on his head. To insure that none of Caligula's line will follow him to power, Caesonia is also stabbed, the child Julia has her head smashed on the marble steps by the Executioner, and the Giant is decapitated by Chaerea. Deranged to the last, the mortally wounded and bloodied Caligula rises to his feet and to which he defiantly whimpers: ""I live!"" Chaerea responds by stabbing Caligula a final time and he falls to the floor. Caligula is finished off when 10 or more of his own guards, seeing their now-hated Emperor dying, gorily stab him to the marble floor with their spears while the horrified Claudius watches. Begging to spare his life, Claudius is given Caligula's robe and ring by Longinus and the servants who hail him as the new Emperor, proclaiming a new era for the Empire. As the unwilling and dull-witted Claudius is carried away, Chaerea, Longinus, and the other conspirators flee from the scene of the crime.As the servants wash the blood off the palace floor following the assassinations, the mutilated and lifeless bodies of Caligula, Caesonia, their daughter, and the Giant's severed head are thrown down the marble steps of the Palace for display to all those in Rome."
The Warriors,1979,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080120/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A street gang known as The Warriors must fight their way from the Bronx to their home turf on Coney Island when they are falsely accused of assassinating a respected gang leader. Cyrus, the leader of the most powerful gang in New York City, the Gramercy Riffs, calls a midnight summit for all the area gangs, with all asked to send nine unarmed representatives for the conclave. A gang called The Warriors are blamed for killing Cyrus as he gives his speech. They now have to cross the territory of rivals in order to get to their own 'hood. The Warriors slowly cross the dangerous Bronx and Manhattan territories, narrowly escaping police and other gangs every step of the way.—Anthony Pereyra {hypersonic91@yahoo.com} In a near future, Cyrus is a respected leader that intends to unite the gangs in New York. Cyrus invites the most relevant gangs for a meeting at the Central Park, a neutral turf in a moment of truce. He explains that if the gangs unite, they would be 60,000 members against 20,000 policemen and they could rule New York. Out of the blue, the punk Luther shots Cyrus and blames The Warriors, a gang from Coney Island. There is a riot in the Central Park and the police arrive and put the group under siege. The Warriors try to return to Coney Island while all the gangs decide to hunt them down. The long journey back home of The Warriors begins.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Cyrus, the messianic leader of the Grammercy Riffs, calls for a truce among all the gangs in New York City and asks them all to meet. During the meeting Cyrus proposes that all the gangs unite to form one super gang so that they can take over the city. Unfortunately, as he is addressing the various gangs, he is shot by Luther, the homicidal leader of a gang known as the Rogues. Luther then accuses Cleon, the leader of the Warriors, as the assassin and he is killed by the other gangs. However, the rest of the Warriors escape but now they have a price on their head and the rest of the gangs hunt for the Warriors as they try to make their way back to their home in Coney Island.—Brian Washington <Sargebri@att.net> Cyrus, the charismatic leader of the biggest gang in New York, The Riffs, organises a meeting in the Bronx between all the gangs in the city for which he plans to join all the gangs into one big gang and take over New York.

Now they must bop their way back to coney, while being hunted by both the cops and every gang in the city.—Jordan Crighton As night falls over Coney Island, Cleon (Dorsey Wright), leader of the Warriors, meets up with eight of his most trusted lieutenants to travel by subway to the faraway Bronx. They will be attending an event called by a man named Cyrus, described as ""the one and only."" Throughout the city, other gang delegations are seen entering the subway in their full colors. As the Warriors speculate about the event during their subway ride, we learn that Cyrus, called ""The One and Only"", leader of the largest gang in the city, the Gramercy Riffs, has called a truce of all the gangs in New York. He wants an unarmed delegation of nine from each gang to come to a mass meeting to hear what he has to say. Some of the Warriors are excited at the prospect, while others are skeptical.At Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx, the meeting is well-attended with over 100 gangs represented. The charismatic Cyrus (Roger Hill) takes the stage and delivers a spellbinding speech. He says that, instead of fighting each other over turf, they could unite to form an army of 60,000 soldiers, compared to only 20,000 police in the whole city. He punctuates his points with ""Can you dig it?"" to the crowd's wild response. Outside the meeting area, the police are seen silently moving in.Most of the crowd is enthralled with Cyrus' vision, but one member has his own agenda. Luther (David Patrick Kelley), the psychotic leader of a gang called the Rogues, has snuck a gun into the gathering. At a high point in the speech, Luther fires at Cyrus, killing him instantly. When Cyrus falls back, there is a brief stunned silence, followed by pandemonium. The crowd was so fixated on Cyrus that hardly anyone saw who fired the shot, but Luther turns to see that Fox (Thomas G. Waites) of the Warriors witnessed the assassination, so he points the gun to kill Fox. Just at that moment the police spotlights come on, blinding Luther.Cleon walks towards the middle of the chaos, to see whether Cyrus survived. Luther begins screaming to the crowd, ""That's him! The guy who shot Cyrus!"" Another member of the Rogues also claims to have seen Cleon shoot Cyrus. Cleon denies it, but Luther continues to scream ""The Warriors did it! The Warriors did it!"" and charges at Cleon. Cleon holds his own in a fight against the Rogues, but then the Gramercy Riffs, martial arts experts, step in and bring Cleon down with kicks and elbow hits. Cleon presumably has been killed.The other Warriors break through a wooden fence to make their escape, winding up in a cemetery as the rest of the police rush into the park and the various gangs flee. They take a head count and determine that everyone is there except for Cleon. Swan (Michael Beck), who as war chief is the second-ranked member after Cleon, states they are going to the subway, to catch a train back to Coney Island. A member named Ajax (James Remar) gives Swan some trouble when he asks: ""Who made you leader?"" Swan advises him to make his move, but the remaining members intervene, telling Ajax to calm down and urging everyone to stick together. Ajax backs down for now, and they make their way toward the subway, worrying whether the truce is still on. If it isn't, they will have to ""bop"" (fight their way) across other gangs' territories, vulnerable because they are wearing their colors and are not ""packed"" (armed).Meanwhile, the Gramercy Riffs' new leader, Masai (Edward Sewer), addresses the Riffs at their underground hideout. He wants the Warriors, alive if possible. The Riffs inform a local DJ (Lynne Thigpen), and she puts the word out on the radio, urging all local gangs to be on the lookout and capture or kill the Warriors, ""the gang that broke the truce"", for the Riffs. She dedicates the song ""Nowhere to Run"" to the Warriors. As the song plays, gangs throughout the city are getting ready to hunt down Cyrus' assassins.The Warriors wait for a train outside an elevated train station, so that they will not be ambushed on a open platform. Ajax complains that they are acting like ""wimps,"" but the others' caution is justified, since a school bus filled with a tough-looking skinhead gang known as the Turnbull ACs begins patrolling the area. When the train arrives, the Warriors make a break for it and barely make the train ahead of the gang. Masai is informed of the Turnbulls' failure. Meanwhile, Luther gets a telephone update from an informant and learns that the Riffs have put the word out on the street that they want the Warriors alive. The Rogues don't want the Warriors taken alive, for fear of the stories they might tell. Luther tells his crew that they can do some looking too.The celebrating Warriors' journey home is cut short when a fire on the tracks delays the train. They have no choice but to make their way to the next station on foot. That route takes them directly through the Bronx territory of a small, low-level gang known as the Orphans, who did not attend the gathering at Van Cortlandt Park and apparently don't know of the contract out on the Warriors. After determining the Orphans' numbers to be at least 30 versus their eight, Swan decides a diplomatic solution would be best. He brings Fox with him to meet with the Orphans' leader (Paul Greco). After a bit of tough posturing, the leader accepts the explanation of the subway fire, buttered up a bit by Fox's respectful comments, and tells them they can move through the territory if they come in peace. However, his girlfriend Mercy (Deborah Van Valkenburgh) begins taunting him with chicken noises and cutting comments. The leader's manhood is now insulted, so he orders the Warriors to remove their gang colors if they want to proceed through their territory. Swan refuses in no uncertain terms, and the Orphans leave while the Warriors march on.The curious Mercy tails the Warriors, and gets caught by Ajax. She claims to want some real action. Just then, the Orphans show up again, packed and ready to rumble. They throw some tough words around, but Snow (Brian Tyler) produces a Molotov cocktail, which Swan throws at a car near the Orphans. The Warriors take off past the flaming vehicle. The car explodes, the Orphans fail to pursue, and the Warriors hightail it to the next station with Mercy. She seems determined to stick around for the ride.The DJ passes on the news of the Orphans' defeat. Luther gets another update that the Warriors are making their way through and that the cops are out to get every gang in the city. When asked why he seems so happy about this situation, Luther responds ""I'm having a good time!""The train at the 96th street station is not moving and the frustration of the Warriors, especially Vermin (Terry Michos), is obvious. A police officer walks by the car, and they take off running. During this escape they split into three separate groups. Fox and Mercy run down the platform. A cop comes from behind one of the pillars, and tackles Fox. Fox yells at Mercy to run away, and in the struggle the cop tosses Fox onto the tracks, where he is killed by an oncoming train. Mercy is running in the other direction and doesn't see Fox's death.Vermin, Cochise (David Harris), and Rembrandt (Marcelino Sanchez) manage to evade the police and board a subway train to Union Square, the agreed upon meeting place if they are split up. Ajax, Swan, Snow, and Cowboy (Tom Mckitterick) also outrun the police and exit the station at the front door, only to find a bigger potential threat - a group of men in baseball uniforms, their faces painted, leisurely swinging baseball bats. The Baseball Furies have been waiting for them. The four Warriors take off running down the street. The chase continues into Riverside Park. Swan and Snow split to the side, leaving Ajax and Cowboy running forward. The Furies fail to see the split, and follow Ajax and Cowboy. Swan and Snow circle to the Furies' backs. Cowboy can no longer run, so Ajax turns to face his foes, with Swan coming up from the rear. In the ensuing melee, Ajax's and Swan's fighting skills shine. They succeed in wresting control of bats and eventually in laying out all of the Furies.The DJ announces the Baseball Furies' defeat and disparages all the gangs for their poor performance.Meanwhile, Vermin, Cochise and Rembrandt have arrived at Union Square to wait for the others. They see a group of six young women giving them ""come hither"" looks. Cochise and Vermin can't believe their luck in finding attractive chicks who seem to want to party with them, naively failing to realize that the women are lesbians. Only Rembrandt, the youngest Warrior, senses the danger. They go to the group's clubhouse and the leader (Lisa Mauer) identifies them as the Lizzies, an all-girl gang and says that they want to get down with the Warriors because they've heard of their reputation. Cochise and Vermin waste no time heading off to couches with their choice of girl. Rembrandt stays aloof and says that they need to get back. He notices the women exchanging glances, but before he can react, the door is locked and the leader pulls a gun and says ""So you guys are the famous Warriors? The guys who shot Cyrus."" Rembrandt shouts a warning and the three crash through a door, dodging bullets to escape. Rembrandt informs the others of what he has learned; that the women thought the Warriors shot Cyrus. They finally realize that every gang in the city must be looking for them.Swan and his crew continue walking through the park. They pass a lady on a bench (Mercedes Ruehl), who gives her best smile. Ajax decides to play games with the woman, and won't be dissuaded even after the others press on him the need to get home. Ajax disparages the others' manhood and turns back toward the woman. A few minutes later, Cowboy and Snow decide to go back to look after Ajax, and Swan continues to the station alone. The woman turns out to be an undercover cop, and Ajax is arrested when he tries to assault her, getting himself handcuffed to the bench they were sitting on. There's nothing Cowboy and Snow can do, so they make their way to Union Square.When Swan gets back to the 96th street station, he finds Mercy still hanging around. A cop spots them, and the two wind up running into a tunnel. Holed up in an underpass off the tracks, Mercy comes on to Swan. He insults her and says he wants to find something better. Mercy declares that Swan isn't any better than her. Swan continues on to Union Square and Mercy follows him. The Punks, who's leader wears roller skates, spot Swan on the subway platform and hang around waiting for their chance.Meanwhile, Snow and Cowboy have made it to Union Square and meet up with Cochise, Rembrandt and Vermin. Swan sees his fellow Warriors and signals them to lead the Punks into the men's room. They hide in the stalls, and ambush the Punks with Rembrandt's spray paint. The ensuing battle, which Mercy joins on the Warriors' side, is another victory for the Warriors.Back at the Riff's headquarters, Masai is told that there is a new witness who saw who really shot Cyrus.The six remaining Warriors board the final train home, with Mercy still in tow. Two young couples in evening dress coming from a school prom present such a contrast to Swan and Mercy that Swan takes pity on Mercy and clumsily signals that he accepts her. One of them drops a flower and Swan picks it up.Upon arrival at Coney Island, the sun has risen, and the journey is seemingly over. Swan gives Mercy the flower he'd picked up on the train, saying he hates seeing beautiful things go to waste. The Warriors and Mercy walk through the deserted Coney Island streets, only to realize that Luther and the Rogues are following them in a hearse. With no time to contact other members to come to their defense, the Warriors take shelter under a dock. Swan now has a switchblade he took from the Punk leader; the others arm themselves with what's around: Furies baseball bats, crowbars, hockey sticks, two-by-four pieces of wood, etc. Luther makes an ominous rattling sound with beer bottles and chants ""Warriors, come out to play-ay!""Swan leads his crew and Mercy out to the beach, and the Rogues follow. Finally face to face, Swan asks Luther why he killed Cyrus, to which the crazed Luther replies: ""No reason. I just... like doing things like that."" When Luther pulls a gun on Swan, he manages to flick his knife into Luther's wrist, disarming him. At that moment, the Gramercy Riffs appear in force on the beach. Swan asks whether the Riffs are still looking for the Warriors, to which Masai replies, looking at Luther, that they have found what they're looking for. Masai praises the Warriors as ""good, real good,"" and makes an exit path for them. They file out to the screams of Luther's death agonies.As the DJ announces that the alert is cancelled, the six surviving Warriors walk down their hometown beach, Swan hand-in-hand with Mercy. They are glad to have made it home, but are also emotionally defeated because they know that they and all the New York City gangs are back where they started from: nowhere."
Norma Rae,1979,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0079638/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A young single mother and textile worker agrees to help unionize her mill despite the problems and dangers involved. Like a lot of her family before her, Norma Rae works at the local textile mill, where the pay is hardly commensurate with the long hours and lousy working conditions. But after hearing a rousing speech by labor activist Reuben, Norma is inspired to rally her fellow workers behind the cause of unionism. Her decision rankles her family, especially her fiancé, Sonny, and provokes no shortage of contempt from her employers.—Jwelch5742 Thirty-one year old widowed mother Norma Rae Wilson lives in the southern US town of Henleyville, which contains one major employer, O.P. Henley Textiles. Like most of her friends and family, she works in Henley's mill - eight hundred on the line - those jobs on which the townsfolk rely to survive. Norma Rae is outspoken in her complaints about the working conditions at the mill, and will do most whatever to ensure a good wage for herself to support her two young children. She has a stable of casual sexual partners purely to relieve her boredom, she not having had a good history with men, with her one husband having died in a bar brawl, and the father of her younger child not having taken any responsibility at all after their sexual encounter. So she is surprised when she runs into a childhood mate, recently divorced Sonny Webster, the two who end up getting married. For Norma Rae, Sonny seems to be the kind of man who will make a good husband and father, the most important qualities in a man at this stage of her life. Like they do every few years, a Textile Workers Union of America representative, this time in the form of New York Jew Reuben Warshowsky, arrives in town, his goal to unionize the workers. They have been unable to do so as the workers fear losing their jobs, Norma Rae no exception. But as she begins to befriend Reuben and trust what he has to say is true, Norma Rae decides to work for him to unionize. As this union work takes over her life, her marriage is in jeopardy. But as the local face of the union, she may risk more in the form of her livelihood, her standing in the community and her family and friends, especially if they do not follow what she and Reuben are espousing.—Huggo Norma Rae is a southern textile worker employed in a factory with intolerable working conditions. This concern about the situation gives her the gumption to be the key associate to a visiting labor union organizer. Together, they undertake the difficult, and possibly dangerous, struggle to unionize her factory.—Kenneth Chisholm <kchishol@execulink.com> Norma Rae is a lively, but dependable, wife and mother in an Alabama mill town. Like her father, her mother and most of her friends, she works at the Henley mill, spinning and weaving cloth as the days go by without much apparent purpose. Her ""nothing special"" life changes when she and her coworkers meet Reuben, a dedicated, smart-mouthed labor organizer down from New York to teach the Henley crew about solidarity in a place where workers and owners alike think ""union"" and ""trouble"" are synonymous.—Mike Rogers <MICHAELPEM@aol.com> Summer 1978Norma Rae Wilson (Sally Field) works at the O.P. Henley Textile Mill. She is having lunch with friend and co-worker, Bonnie Mae (Gail Strickland). Bonnie Mae saw Norma in town last Sunday. 'Your friend drives a mighty big car.' 'If you looked in the motel register, you'd see my name, too.' 'None of my business.' Norma turns away and says to her mother, Leona (Barbara Baxley): 'Mama, you haven't opened your sack yet.' Her mother doesn't respond. 'Mama, can you hear me?' Norma takes her by the hand and hurries to the doctor's office. She tells him her mother didn't hear one word she said. The doctor replies: You know that happens ...it's just temporary. Norma: She's only deaf for 'one hour'...'two hours'... 'all day'. Doctor: She can always get another job. Norma: There are no other jobs.Norma is at home. Her mother is outside potting plants. Norma shouts from the window: 'You alight out there?' 'I'm fine,' her mother replies without hesitation. Norma tells her kids to do their homework, then goes into the bedroom and changes her clothes. Her father (Pat Hingle) enters. She says she's going into town. He offers to drive her. She's going to J.C. Penny's to buy underwear. 'You want to come along and sit outside the dressing room and have all the ladies look at you, then come on.'There's a knock at the front door. 'Mr. Witchard?' Norma's father answers: That's right, Vernon Witchard. Reuben Warshovsky (Ron Leibman) wants to rent a room with a mill family. He's a labor organizer. Come to put a union in the O.P. Henley Textile Mill. Vernon replies, 'You people are Communists, agitators, crooks, or Jews, or all four rolled together. You make folks lose their jobs.' Reuben asks Vernon how much he makes. A dollar thirty-three cents a frame. Reuben says he's underpaid. 'You need me, sir.' Vernon replies, 'If you run real fast you may be able to get back to your car before my dog bites you.' Reuben leaves.Norma is in the lobby of the Golden Cherry motel. Reuben enters and stops to chat, then asks the clerk behind the counter for a room with a view. 'Give him 31, Alston,' says Norma. 'Can't hear the drunks from in there.'Norma is in one of the rooms, putting her clothes on. She tells her lover, George Benson, she's ending the relationship. 'Didn't you get your steak dinner...your box of pralines,' George asks. Norma Rae says, 'You got your kids. There's a lot of gossip. I've got my two kids.' George: 'You're a hick...you got dirt under your fingernails...pick your teeth with a matchbook...What the hell are you good for anyway.' He slaps her so violently she falls against the wall. She leaves, her nose bleeding. Reuben is in the room next door and invites her in as she passes his door. He puts ice on her bleeding nose.Norma extends her hand: 'Norma Rae Wilson...Are you a Jew?' 'Born and bred,' Reuben replies. 'I never met a Jew before.' 'What makes you different from the rest of us? 'History.The bleeding stops and Norma leaves.Reuben is outside the textile mill handing out fliers. He's from the Textile Workers' Union of America. Norma passes Reuben to start her shift. Reuben asks, 'How's your nose?' A plant manager asks Norma if she knows the organizer.A mill manager, Jimmy Jerome Davis (Jack Stryker), says to Reuben, 'One of you guys shows up every four years, about the same time we get the locusts.' Reuben: We got six of you boys in civil contempt. Would you care to make it seven? Davis: We plaster the toilet with them things.Norma is called into the boss' office. The boss, Tommy Gardner (Lonnie Chapman) says, 'Norma you got the biggest mouth in this mill. ""Give us a longer break. Give us more smoking time. Give us a Kotex pad machine.""' The only way to get her to close that mouth is to give her a promotion. She's going to be a spot checker. 'Well, hell, it sure ain't gonna make me any friends.' 'It'll make you an extra dollar and a half an hour. 'Norma accepts the position. On the mill floor, she monitors employees as they work. She comes to her father's station. She asks him to speed up if he can. 'I'm going as fast as I can.' 'They're watching me. They're watching you,' she says. At home, her father gives her the silent treatment, then, 'I don't think you should push your own Daddy. I don't need that from my kid.'A nighttime softball game. Norma goes to the concession stand to buy a hot dog and runs into Reuben again. She also comes across Ellis Harper, the father one of her two children. Reuben follows her back to her seat. 'I climbed into the backseat of his Cadillac one rainy night six years ago, stuck my feet out the back window, and got myself my little Craig off that Southern gentleman. He ain't done nothin' worthwhile since.' She asks Reuben: What do you think of me? 'I think you're too smart for what's happening to you.'Back at the mill. Norma is spot-checking Sonny Webster (Beau Bridges). He mocks her, speeds up, jumps into a cart of loose cotton, weaves in and out and around the machinery. 'Come on, lady. I'm over here now! Mark me down! Mark me down!' 'You damn fool! You're gonna get us both to lose our jobs.'Norma is at home folding laundry and the doorbell rings. It's Sonny Webster. He's come to apologize. He got handed divorce papers that morning. Norma steps out on to the porch to speak with him. He asks if she would have a drink with him. She agrees and goes inside to get ready. Her father reminds her of all the men she's had relationships with, none of whom are taking care of her now. She goes out anyway.At the bar, Sonny and Norma are drinking. Reuben appears. A song comes on the jukebox that reminds Norma of her husband's death-Buddy Wilson was killed in a fight in a 'beer joint.' Reuben drives Sonny and Norma home.Back at the mill. Norma is ignored by her co-workers. She goes to the boss' office. She's quitting. 'You're speeding up the machines to weed them out.' 'You knew all that.' 'Yeah. I was greedy, and I was dumb.' She throws down her clipboard, takes off her spotter's jacket, and goes back to her machine. One of her co-workers helps her on with her apron.Sonny takes Norma, her kids, and his daughter, Alice, to the lake. There he describes the type of husband he will be if they were married. They get married.Bonnie Mae hands Norma a flier. Reuben is speaking at a meeting that evening, and she's going.The meeting is at a local church, a black church. Norma and Bonnie Mae are seated in the front row. They are the only white people present, other than three white men at the back. Reuben gives an impassioned speech about what a union is: One. Different people, different races, different religions, speaking with one voice. The textile industry is the only industry in the United States that is not unionized. 'They are free to exploit you, to lie to you, to cheat you, and to take away from you what is rightfully yours. I urge you to come over to Room 31 at the Golden Cherry Motel and pick up a union card and sign it.' Norma's is transfixed with Reuben as she applauds.Reuben arrives at the mill for an inspection. Even though the O.P. Henley mill is not unionized, a federal government court order stipulates the textile union has the right to inspect every bulletin board in the mill to ensure its notices are not being stripped off.Accompanied by a group of managers, Reuben inspects the first bulletin board. The notice is way above eye level. After Reuben threatens to call his lawyer, the notice is lowered so that its easily seen. He reads the notice and demands to see the other bulletin board. He is ushered through the weaving room. On his way he passes Norma at her machine. The second bulletin board is almost entirely hidden behind rolls of textile material. He has the textiles removed. Norma follows the developments from a distance.Norma visits Reuben at the motel. 'If I joined up with you will I lose my job?' Reuben: No way. You can wear a union button, talk union to co-workers during your break, hand out union pamphlets. They can't touch you. Norma Rae: I'll go along with you. Reuben: You're the fish I wanted to hook. Norma Rae Webster signs up and begins recruiting volunteers.Norma asks her reverend to allow a union meeting at the white church the following Saturday. 'Blacks and whites sitting together.' The reverend refuses.Norma invite black and white co-workers to her house for the union meeting. Norma explains to her neighbor why black men are at her house. 'The shades are going to be up.' Sonny takes Norma aside: You're going too far, Norma. This is our home. Norma Rae: How am I going too far? Sonny: There's a bunch of black men in there. You're gonna get us in a whole bunch of trouble. Norma Rae: I never had any trouble with black men. The only trouble I ever had in my life was with white men.The mill workers tell their stories of hardships at the mill.After the meeting Reuben tells Norma he isn't getting his message across. 'Only 17 people out of 800.' It's because you're an outsider, she replies. Reuben: You got any ideas? Norma Rae: Get some corn whiskey and meet on Saturday. We're gonna hit the back roads.
Reuben and Norma drive around the back roads handing out fliers. At one stop Reuben slips, falls, and soils his shirt on a mound of cow dung. Norma Rae: Its only grass and water, Reuben. At a waterhole Norma washes the shirt while Reuben swims in the nude. Reuben: This is the life! Norma finishes washing the shirt, strips off, and jumps in.Late at night Norma is seated at her dining table, on the phone doing union business. Sonny emerges from the bedroom: You ain't gettin' any sleep. I ain't gettin' any sleep and I got to get to work in the mornin'. Norma says she's got a hundred phone calls to make. Sonny is angry. Norma didn't get to the market, to the kids, and 'to me!' Norma, even more angry, rises, and mocks doing the household chores-cooking, washing, ironing, making love. Sonny calms down, strokes her face, and kisses her on the cheek.Norma is handing out union information during her break. Unlike Reuben, she can relate to the workers on a personal level. Norma's father, Vernon, is sitting by the gate. 'Well I don't bump into you much anymore now, do I?' 'You alright Daddy?' 'Sometimes I wonder when I lie down if I'm gonna get back up again'. 'Don't talk old to me. I don't like it.' 'I'm gonna come over there one of these nights...and take you out to a grand supper.' 'OK.'Millworkers are being stretched at the mill. Then, at the next union meeting, no one shows up. Reuben visits one of the volunteers who quit volunteering, Warren Latting. Warren: 'They got us on a stretch-out. Put us on a three-day week. Twice as much work for half the pay. All on account of you.' He shows Reuben six turnips and two quarts of water. Dinner for seven people. 'Just go sell your union someplace else.' He slams the door in Reuben's face.Vernon is working feverishly at his post. Jimmy Jerome Davis comes over. 'My arm's going numb on me, Jimmy. I think I better go and lie down.' 'You got a break in fifteen minutes.' Minutes later Vernon collapses. Norma and family attend Vernon's funeral.At the Golden Cherry motel, mill-workers are back doing union work. Norma chews out a worker who shows up late. Reuben throws her out of the room but catches up with her at a nearby diner. 'You can't come down that hard on a man...Leave him his balls.' 'You ain't mad at me?' 'If the situation ever called for a smart, loud, profane, sloppy, hard-working woman, I'd pick you every time, kid.'Late one night, Norma is napping at the Golden Cherry motel. She is awakened by two men. They're from the union national headquarters. When Reuben arrives, they suggest Norma leave. Reuben: 'What do you guys want?' 'This is a small Baptist town,' one man replies. 'The mill hands in this town go to church every Sunday. They say she's made a porno movie with a local police officer. Very explicit...' 'Show it to me.' 'There doesn't have to be a movie, people just talk like there's one. The lady has an illegitimate child. She's slept around.' Reuben: 'I don't believe this. Are we in the union business or are we in the character assassination business...Do you know that this woman has broken her ass for this organization? She doesn't see her kids. She doesn't have time to take a bath...Get the hell out of here!' He shows them the door.The O.P. Henley management posts a letter saying the black workers are going to take over the union. A group of white thugs beat up a black mill-worker. Several black men come to his defense, and a fight breaks out between black and white mill-workers. Norma calls Reuben. 'We can take legal action,' he says. He asks Norma for a copy of the letter. She can't do that. 'How good is your memory?' 'I still don't know the pledge of allegiance to the flag.' Reuben: Get someone to help you. Write it down a line at a time.Norma tries to memorize the letter but can't. Reuben is furious. 'Don't tell me you can't remember. You walk up to it. You stand there. You copy it down, word for word, line for line. You get me the date. You get me the signature. You get it all and you get it back here to me.' At the mill, Norma, with pencil and paper, copies the letter. Two managers tell her to stop; more managers gather around until she's surrounded by seven men. One manager, Mr. Mason (Noble Willingham) sticks his face mere inches from hers: 'You stop what you're doing. Right. Now.' She defiantly continues copying the letter.When Norma's done, Mason summons her to his office. 'Lady, I want you off the premises. Now!..I want you outta here right quick.' Norma refuses to leave. She brushes past the other managers, into the factory floor, among the other workers. She screams above the din of the machinery. 'It's gonna take you, the police department, and the fire department, and the National Guard to get me out of here! I'll wait for the sheriff to come and take me home. And I ain't gonna budge until he gets here. She jumps up on a table, writes 'UNION' on a piece of cardboard, and holds it with both hands high above her head. The workers stop to see what's going on. Norma's mother shuts down her machine. One by one the workers turn off their machines until the mill is dead quiet.Sheriff Lamar Miller escorts Norma off the premises. There is a police car waiting outside. Norma realizes she's not going home, but to jail, and puts up a fight. Several policemen carry Norma, kicking and screaming, to the car, and throw her into the back seat. At the station, Norma is booked. Charge: Disorderly Conduct. Norma has one phone call-- 'You can call Sonny.' 'I'll be calling my union organizer.'Reuben bails Norma out and drives her home. She immediately wakes up the kids and sits them down in the living room. You kids are going to be hearing a lot of things about me, she says, but 'you're going to hear it from me first.' She tells them she loves them, and who their fathers are. 'If you go in the mill, I want life to be better for you than it is for me. That's why I joined up with the union, and that's why I got fired for it...Now, you kids, you know what I am. And you know that I believe in standing up for what I think is right.' She kisses each one of them and sends them back to bed. She leaves to take a bath, and Sonny and Reuben are left alone in the living room. Sonny: She had one call, and she called you. Reuben: She knew I could make bail. Sonny: You come in here, you mix her up, you turn her all around...She's all changed...What's gonna happen to us now? Reuben: She's a free woman. Maybe you can live with it, maybe you can't. He turns and leaves.Norma is in bed. Sonny enters. 'Did you ever sleep with him?' 'No. But he's in my head.' Sonny: 'I'm gonna see you through getting tired, getting sick, getting old. I'm gonna see you through anything that comes up. And there's nobody else in my head. Just you.' He turns the light off and lies down, his back to her.The ballots are counted. 'Folks, ballots tabulated for the O.P. Henley Company. Against the union, 373. The count for the union, 427.' The workers erupt in cheers, hugs and tears, and chant: 'U-nion! U-nion! U-nion! U-nion!' Outside, beyond the fence, Reuben and Norma hear the cheers. They walk towards Reuben's little car, crammed with union materials. Reuben: What're you gonna do now? Norma Rae: Live. What else? At the car, parked directly in front of the O.P. Henley Company sign, Reuben says, 'I don't say goodbye. I have been known to cry.' 'Well, what do you say?' 'Be happy. Be well.' 'Same to you.' 'Best wishes don't seem hardly enough. I'd like to thank you. I thank you for your companionship, your stamina, your horse sense, and 101 laughs. I also enjoyed very much looking at your shining hair and your shining face.' 'Reuben, I think you like me.' 'I do.' 'I was gonna buy you a tie clip, or shaving lotion or something, but I didn't know what you'd like.' 'Norma, what I've had from you has been sumptuous.' He extends his right hand. She takes it. They look into each other's eyes for what seems like an eternity. He gets into his car. She watches him drive away, and is left standing alone in front of the O.P. Henley Textile Mill building."

In 1987, Captain William ""Buck"" Rogers pilots his space shuttle Ranger 3 on a mission but a meteor storm freezes him into an orbit that returns him to Earth - 500 years later. In 2491, his shuttle is found and captured by the Draconian flagship, under the command of Princess Ardala and her second-in-command Kane. Reviving him, they return him to Earth after secretly planting a homing beacon aboard his shuttle to track a path through Earth's defense barrier. Buck is under arrest and learns that Earth has been rebuilt over the centuries in his absence following a nuclear holocaust. Buck Rogers must adjust to the 25th century, and convince the Terrans that the Draconians are secretly planning to conquer Earth.—David Thiel <d-thiel@uiuc.edu> In 1987, Captain William ""Buck"" Rogers, on a mission to launch a space probe, is placed in suspended animation into an orbit that only returns his shuttle to our solar system - 500 years later. His shuttle is captured by the Draconian flagship, under the command of Princess Ardala and her henchman Kane, a former native of Earth. Reviving him, they deceive him into returning to Earth after secretly planting a tracer on his shuttle to learn the path through Earth's defense barrier. Under the command of Colonel Wilma Deering, the Earth Space Forces intercept him and Buck is under arrest. Buck Rogers must adjust to this new time, address the suspicions of the Terrans who accuse him of espionage, and protect Earth from the threat that the Draconians secretly pose.—Kenneth Chisholm <kchishol@home.com> In 1987, NASA astronaut Captain William ""Buck"" Rogers (Gil Gerard) is piloting the space shuttle Ranger 3 when he flies into an unexpected space phenomenon and is frozen for 504 years. In the year 2491, his shuttle is found drifting in space by the alien flagship Draconia, which is headed to Earth for a trade conference, under the command of Princess Ardala (Pamela Hensley) and her aide-de-camp, Kane (Henry Silva), a former native of Earth. Rogers is revived from his cryogenic sleep and is questioned by the princess and Kane. Princess Ardala is visibly attracted to Buck, though Kane arranges for Buck to be placed back on his shuttle and returned towards Earth.It turns out that the Draconians are actually planning to conquer Earth through staged pirate attacks on Earth's shipping fleet, forcing Earth to seek a treaty with the Draconians and unwittingly opening up their defenses to the invaders. They plant a homing beacon aboard Rogers' shuttle to track a way through Earth's planet-wide defense shield. Buck lands in New Chicago and is immediately taken into custody by Colonel Wilma Deering (Erin Gray), commander of Earth's military forces. He is interrogated and learns that Earth has been rebuilt over the centuries in his absence following a nuclear holocaust, and now much of Earth outside this huge city is a desolate, radioactive wasteland. Over the course of his time in detention, Buck meets Dr. Elias Huer (Tim O'Connor) the leader of Earth's Defense Directorate, the AI computer Dr. Theopolis, and the robot drone Twiki (voice of Mel Blanc), most of whom attempt to help him adjust to his current surroundings.While recounting his encounter with the Draconians, Buck notices several discrepancies and suspects that the Draconians must be armed, contrary to the terms of the trade meeting. Against advice, Buck ventures outside the city to the ruins of old Chicago in an attempt to find out that what he has been told is real, eventually finding his own parents' grave and having to be rescued by Wilma and her troops from the mutants inhabiting the ruins. Following Buck's return to the Inner City, the Draconian tracking device is found aboard his shuttle, and the authorities accuse Buck of espionage and sentence him to death. Buck claims that the Draconians simply used him, and eventually Wilma persuades Dr. Huer to prove Buck's claims by requesting a meeting with Princess Ardala and Kane aboard the Draconia. During the meeting, the pirate ships (actually Draconian marauders) attack their flagship as a diversion, but Buck manages to destroy them single-handedly, thus earning Wilma's respect.At the official diplomatic reception on Earth, Ardala, still attracted to Buck, invites him back to the Draconia. Buck uses the invitation to go aboard and find out the truth behind the Draconians' scheme. On the ship, Ardala informs Buck she needs a man such as him to rule by her side and offers Buck the position. After drugging Ardala, Buck explores the ship and discovers their marauders and plans to launch an imminent attack on Earth. Dr. Theopolis and Twiki, who have followed Buck aboard, eventually meet up with him and alert Earth to the Draconian invasion. Wilma immediately scrambles Earth's starfighters and attacks the Draconia, while Buck sabotages the Draconian marauders prepared to attack Earth and fights off Ardala's bodyguard, Tigerman. During the battle, the Draconia is critically damaged, but Buck, Theopolis and Twiki are rescued by Wilma before the ship explodes. Ardala and Kane also escape before the Draconia's destruction in an escape shuttle, while Kane vows to return and to take his revenge on Rogers."

At first the unidentified caller says nothing and Jill thinks an acquaintance is playing a prank. Several similar calls have her unnerved enough to call the police when the silent stranger still offers no clue to his identity. The phone calls continue - Finally, an eerie voice on the other end of the line asks ominously ""Have you checked the children lately?"" Apparently the stranger can see her and follow her movements. She closes all the curtains and turns out the lights believing that the darkness is her only hiding place. By now the police are tracing the origin of the calls and they tell Jill she must stall for time the next time he calls so they can complete the trace. More calls - ""Why haven't you checked the children?"" Jill, by now frightened nearly out of her wits, screams into the receiver ""Leave me alone!"" and slams the phone down into its cradle. The next time the phone rings it's the police: ""We've traced the calls...they're coming from inside the house!""—Mark Fleetwood <mfleetwo@mail.coin.missouri.edu> In Los Angeles, California, teenager Jill Johnson (Carol Kane) arrives to babysit at the Mandrakis residence. Before leaving for the evening, Mrs. Mandrakis (Rutayna Alda) informs Jill that she and her husband, Dr. Mandrakis (Carmen Argenziano), might see a movie after dinner, which means they could be gone until midnight. She also requests that Jill not disturb the two children, who are asleep and recovering from a cold. During the evening, Jill remains downstairs and studies in the living room. After awhile, the telephone rings. When Jill answers, a man with a British accent asks, ""Have you checked the children?"" then hangs up. He calls back, repeating the question. As the same voice telephones several more times, Jill wonders if her friend, Bobby, is playing a practical joke. Rattled, she pours herself a glass of whiskey, then tries to reach Dr. and Mrs. Mandrakis at the restaurant, but they already left. Next, she contacts the police, but the officer says he is unable to offer much help unless the caller threatens her. When Jill answers another time, the anonymous caller poises the question more emphatically.Sensing that the man is outside watching her, she closes the curtains and bolts the front door. She does not pick up as the phone rings again, then redials the police. Sgt. Sacker (Bill Boyett) reassures her that he will attempt to trace the call, and Jill manages to keep the stranger on the line for longer next time. As soon as he hangs up, the sergeant telephones and states that the call is coming from inside the house. He orders Jill to leave immediately. Looking up, she sees a man's shadow at the top of the stairs. She frantically opens the front door as the police arrive. The intruder upstairs is apprehended, but he is covered in the blood of the two Mandrakis children, whom he killed several hours earlier. By the time detective John Clifford (Charles Durning) appears on the scene, the parents have returned home and are trying to comprehend the tragedy. Officer Charlie Garber informs Clifford that the killer, a British citizen named Curt Duncan (Tony Beckley), used a second telephone line inside the house to call the babysitter, who was not hurt.Seven years later.Clifford has retired from the police force and works as a private investigator. Dr. Mandrakis hires him to find Duncan, who has recently escaped from the state mental hospital. Clifford questions Duncan's supervising physician, Dr. Monk (Rachel Roberts), who believes the patient is no longer a threat to children and feels confident that the intensive therapy, including electric shock treatment, was helpful, but Clifford would prefer clues as to the whereabouts of the psychopath.Meanwhile, at a bar downtown called Torchy's, Duncan tries to converse with a single, middle-aged woman named Tracy Fuller (Colleen Dewhurst), but she ignores him. When Duncan remains persistent, another bar patron assaults him. Tracy suddenly feels sympathy for the British man as he is dragged into the alley. Walking home alone that night, she is unaware that Duncan follows her. He appears outside her apartment door and apologizes for his behavior at the bar. Tracy is initially considerate until Duncan insists on staying and having coffee. After finally persuading him to leave, she feels unnerved by the stranger.At police headquarters, Clifford receives cooperation from his former colleague, Garber, who is now a lieutenant, and combs through recent crime reports. He also questions vagrants on the street and shows them a photograph of Duncan. After inquiring about the fight at Torchy's, Clifford tracks down Tracy and enlists her help in trapping the child murderer. Clifford then confides to Garber (Ron O'Neal) that he plans to kill Duncan and requests that the police do not get involved. Reluctantly, Garber agrees.As instructed, Tracy leaves Torchy's and walks back to her apartment alone at night, while Clifford watches for anyone following her. Duncan, however, does not appear. Nevertheless, Clifford assures Tracy that he will keep patrol outside her building. As Tracy settles in for the evening, Duncan, who has been hiding inside the apartment, surprises her and pleads with her for friendship. Hearing Tracy scream, Clifford storms into the apartment, but is unable to catch the killer as he flees. With a tip from a vagrant, Clifford locates Duncan at a homeless shelter, and the two men confront each other. Clifford aims a lethal lock needle towards the murderer, but Duncan dodges the weapon and escapes.Meanwhile, Jill Johnson still lives in Los Angeles, but is now married to Stephen Lockhart (Steven Anderson) and has two young children. As she prepares to cook dinner for the family, her husband telephones and announces that he is taking her to a restaurant. Jill then arranges for Sharon to babysit the children. While Jill and Stephen are enjoying dinner, the maître d' at the restaurant interrupts and informs the couple that they have a telephone call. When Jill picks up the receiver, the familiar voice with the British accent says, ""Have you checked the children?"" Jill screams that Curt Duncan is back, and Stephen immediately calls the babysitter, who assures the parents that everything is fine at home.Accompanied by a police officer, Stephen and Jill return to the house, and are relieved to find that the children are okay. Nevertheless, Stephen places a rifle by his bedside. Meanwhile, at police headquarters, Garber hears about the incident with Mrs. Lockart and alerts Clifford. When Clifford telephones the Lockhart home and receives a constant busy signal, the operator notifies him that the line appears to have been recently disconnected.Meanwhile, Jill cannot sleep. Checking on her son, she notices a piece of candy in his room that she did not give him. Frightened, she goes back to her bedroom. There, she hears Duncan's voice and assumes he is hiding in the closet. She shakes her husband in the bed, but instead, Duncan jumps out from underneath the covers. As the killer tries to strangle Jill, Clifford suddenly arrives and shoots Duncan dead. The private investigator comforts Jill and assures her that Stephen, who was knocked unconscious and placed in a closet, is fine."

Life of Brian,1979,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0079470/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Born on the original Christmas in the stable next door toJesus Christ, Brian of Nazareth spends his life being mistaken for a messiah. The story of Brian of Nazareth (Graham Chapman), born on the same day as Jesus of Nazareth, who takes a different path in life that leads to the same conclusion. Brian joins a political resistance movement aiming to get the Romans out of Judea. Brian scores a victory of sorts when he manages to paint political slogans on an entire wall in the city of Jerusalem. The movement is not very effective but somehow Brian becomes a prophet and gathers his own following. His fate is sealed however and he lives a very short life.—garykmcd As the otherwise mighty Romans try to rule 33 A.D. Judea with an iron hand, Three Wise Men from the east arrive at a humble manger, intent on delivering their precious gifts to newbornJesus Christ. Instead, they visit poor Mandy Cohen and her baby boy named Brian at their dilapidated stable, only to set in motion a series of unforeseen coincidences. As a result, thirty-three long years later, against the backdrop of a new religion, Brian has now become an active member of the subversive movement known as the ""People's Front of Judea"", only to find himself mistaken for the prophesied Messiah, after a botched act of extremism. Now, there's no turning back, and the cross awaits him. Can Brian prove that he was just a boy living a few stables away from Jesus?—Nick Riganas Brian is born in a stable on Christmas, right next to You Know Who. The wise men appear and begin to distribute gifts. The star moves further, so they take it all back and move on. This is how Brian's life goes. The Jews are looking for a release from the Romans, Spiritual and political decay, keep looking for signs and a group decides Brian is the Messiah. He cannot convince them he is not. He joins the Peoples' Front of Judea, one of several dozen separatist groups who actually do nothing, but really hate the Romans. While not about Jesus, it is about those who hadn't time, or interest to listen to his message. Many Political and Social comments.—John Vogel <jlvogel@comcast.net> Brian Cohen is born in a stable a few doors down from the one in which Jesus is born, a fact which initially confuses the three wise men who come to praise the baby Jesus, as they must put up with Brian's boorish mother Mandy until they realize their mistake.Brian grows up to be an idealistic young man who resents the continuing Roman occupation of Judea, even after learning his father was a Roman Centurion - Naughtius Maximus. While attending Jesus' Sermon on the Mount, he becomes attracted to a young female rebel, Judith. His desire for Judith and hatred for the Romans lead him to join the People's Front of Judea, one of many factious and bickering separatist movements, who spend more time fighting each other than the Romans.The group's cynical leader Reg gives Brian his first assignment as a rebel: an attempt at scrawling some graffiti (""Romanes eunt domus"", poorly translated Latin for ""Romans Go Home"") on the wall of the governor's palace. He is soon confronted by a passing Centurion who, in disgust at Brian's faulty Latin grammar, forces him to write out the grammatically correct message (""Romani ite domum"") one hundred times. The walls of the fortress are literally covered in text by dawn.When the Roman guards change shifts at daybreak, the new guards immediately try to arrest Brian. After a series of misadventures, the fugitive winds up in a motley group of mystics and prophets who harangue the passing crowd in a plaza. Forced to come up with something plausible in order to blend in, he babbles pseudo-religious nonsense which quickly attracts a small but intrigued audience. Once the Roman guards have left, Brian tries to put the episode behind him, but has unintentionally inspired a movement; and a crowd begins to follow him around, with even the slightest unusual occurrence being hailed as a ""miracle."" After slipping away from the mob (who are busy persecuting a ""heretic"") and spending the night with Judith, he discovers that an enormous crowd proclaiming him the Messiah has formed outside his Mother's house. Appalled, Brian is helpless to change the people's minds, as his every word and action are immediately seized as a point of doctrine.The Romans finally catch the hapless Brian and he is scheduled to be crucified. Pontius Pilate asks the crowd whom he should pardon, but is fed various ""fake"" names intended to highlight his strong lisp, much to the their amusement. Pilate eventually orders Brian's release, but in a moment parodying the climax of the film Spartacus, the various crucified people all claim to be ""Brian of Nazareth"", and the wrong man is released. Abandoned by anyone who might be able to help him, the actual Brian remains hanging in the hot sun, and is told by his fellow sufferers, in song, to ""Always Look on the Bright Side of Life""."

They find fish that grow many times their normal size, and also a series of bizarre and grisly murders. Veteran Director John Frankenheimer manages to present ""Prophecy"" as both a monster movie, and a suspenseful tale about the deadly forces which result from the pollution of the environment.—J Rice The idealistic Dr. Robert Verner is invited by his friend Vic to travel to the Maine with his wife Maggie working for the Environmental Protection Agency to prepare a report about the dispute between Indians ""Opies"" (meaning the original people) and the lumberjacks. Maggie is pregnant but she has not told to Robert since he does not want to have children. Robert and Maggie are welcomed by the director of the paper mill Bethel Isely that drives them to their cabin in the woods. However they find an Indian blockage of the road and witness a conflict between the leader of the Opies John Hawks and Isely and his men. On the next morning, Robert goes fishing and he sees a huge salmon in the river. Then they meet with John Hawk and his wife Ramona and they tell that their people are ill and most of their babies are born with deformation. They also hear about the legendary Katahdin and visit the Garden of Eden of the Opies, where Robert finds weird plants with roots on the surface and a huge tadpole. Robert continues to investigate and discovers that the industry is using methyl mercury in the process that is causing the mutagen in the environment.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Tracking two lost lumberjacks through the night, a rescue team nearly follows a hound over a cliff. Two men rappel down to retrieve the fallen hound, but they are killed. The third, hearing screams down below, rappels down to investigate, where he finds his team mates dead, only to be killed himself by an unidentified creature.Dr. Robert Verne is fed up with dealing with the squalor of city tenements. He does not feel he is making a difference. He accepts a job from the United States Environmental Protection Agency to write a report on a logging operation near the Androscoggin River in Maine. The loggers are in a dispute with the local American Indian ""Opies"" (i.e., ""O.P.s""), the original people.Dr. Verne's wife Maggie accompanies him on the trip. She is pregnant but is apprehensive to tell her husband as he is set against having children. When they fly in, they meet a man, Travis Nelson and his two children Paul and Kathleen who are embarking on a trek into the wilderness. They also meet Bethel Isely , the director of the paper mill, who is to be their host. He tells them about his missing rescue team and lays the blame at the feet of the Opies. The latter have their own explanation: Katahdin, a vengeful spirit of the forest that has been awakened by the activities of the loggers. Isely describes Katahdin as ""larger than a dragon with the eyes of a cat"".As Isely drives the couple to their cabin, their path is barred by a party of Opies. They refuse to let Isely's people pass and a fight ensues between the leader of the Opies John Hawks Armand Assante and Kelso (Everett Creach), one of Isely's heavies. The heavy is armed with a chainsaw while Hawks has only a double-bit axe. The scuffle ends with Hawks laid on the ground with the chainsaw nearly at his throat. The Opies relent and let the cars pass. Verne and Maggie are visibly shocked by the incident.While fishing, Verne sees a huge salmon devour a duck. Later, after he and Maggie have eaten his catch, they are attacked in their cabin by a deranged raccoon. Verne kills it and sends a tissue sample to be tested.The next day Hawks and his wife Ramona Victoria Racimo approach Dr. Verne to put over their side of the story. If Verne is concerned about the environment then he should include the people in his assessment. Something is making the people ill: still births, mental illness and birth defects are rife. Hawks takes Verne and Maggie to the home of Hector M'Rai, Ramona's grandfather. Hector claims to have seen Katahdin and describes him as ""part of everything in God's creation"". Verne sees plant roots growing on the surface that should be underground; Hawk nets a bullfrog-sized tadpole from the water to show Verne; Hector has cigarette burns on his hand but feels no pain. As the evidence mounts the idyllic setting gradually takes on a sinister hue.Verne and Maggie tour the paper mill to look for incriminating evidence but the chemicals used in the processing are demonstrated to never leave the plant. Isely tells them that the water is routinely tested for purity. As they leave, however, Verne notices mercury deposits on Maggie's boots. It is a mutagen that causes birth defects and progressive nerve damage. It has long been used in logging as a fungicide because it is cheap. It will not show up in Isely's water purity tests because it sinks to the bottom. Verne needs more evidence and determines to take blood tests from the Opies.That night, the Nelson family, who have set up a camp in the woods, are suddenly assaulted by Katahdin; a ferocious bear with one of it's sides containing horribly mutated skin. The horrified Paul tries to flee, but the beast swats him into a rock, killing him. The next day as Verne and Maggie are taking blood samples, Isely and Sheriff Bartholomew Pilgrim arrive to arrest Hawks and his men whom they mistakenly believe to be the ones who killed the Nelson family. Hawks, however, escapes. Verne, Maggie and Ramona take a helicopter to the campsite to investigate the killings. Verne and Ramona find huge scratch marks on the trees while Maggie finds two mutated bear cubs trapped in a salmon poacher's net. One of the cubs is still alive and Verne is determined to save it so it can serve as empirical evidence of the contamination. However, the weather has turned and the pilot, Huntoon, refuses to take off in the high wind.They make for Hector's home and Verne sends Hawks to fetch Isely and the sheriff. Verne sets up an emergency room in one of Hector's tepees and helps the cub survive. Maggie is clearly distressed by the ordeal so Verne takes her aside and assures her that it will all be over soon. Shockingly, she reveals to him that she is pregnant and she has eaten contaminated fish like the mother of the cubs.Isely and Sheriff Pilgrim arrive and see the mutant cub. Isely is contrite, knowing that Hawks and his men weren't the killers. Hector arrives, when suddenly Katahdin attacks the camp in search of her cubs and kills everyone in sight. Everyone else seeks shelter in tunnels beneath Hector's home. All goes quiet so Pilgrim decides to check it out. He pokes his head up out of the tunnel and Katahdin kills him.The next day, the survivors make their way out of the forest. The helicopter is not an option as Huntoon was severely mauled in the beast's initial attack. Isely heads up to Mount Emery to try to reach a radio tower and call for help. Isley finds the radio tower but the monster immediately finds him and before Isley is able to call help, Katahdin kills him as well. The others find the Opie village mysteriously isolated and the Opie people gone, but take a truck and try to drive out along the winding forest road. Katahdin turns the truck over and finishes Huntoon off by devouring his head. The others run off through the forest with the beast in pursuit.They arrive at the river and swim across. The cub continues to bite Maggie but Rob pulls it off her and holds it underwater, drowning it. Hector stays behind to make Katahdin flee but fails and he is killed as well. Katahdin seems reluctant to follow them at first, but then enters the water and vanishes. They believe she drowned but then she suddenly emerges. They take shelter in a log cabin, but Katahdin tears down the walls. Maggie is knocked unconscious by debris, but Ramona is crushed. It is later revealed that she survived the incident.Verne finds a Winchester Model 1892 rifle in the cabin and shoots the monster twice with some effect. Hawks shoots arrows into Katahdin's hide until the beast sends him airborne with a mighty swat from her paws, then he lands on the ground, dead and bloodied. Verne picks up an arrow, then Katahdin hoists him up, only to be stabbed repetitively in the face and eyes until she collapses into the lake. Rob notices that the monster still moves slightly and leaps onto the beast and stabs her a few more times until her corpse finally sinks below the water.Verne and Maggie fly over the forest the next day, but not knowing that there is another mutant animal still alive in the forest."
Breaking Away,1979,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078902/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A working-class Indiana teen obsessed with the Italian cycling team vies for the affections of a college girl while searching for life goals with his friends. Best friends Dave, Mike, Cyril and Moocher have just graduated from high school. Living in the college town of Bloomington, Indiana, they are considered ""cutters"": the working class of the town so named since most of the middle aged generation, such as their parents, worked at the local limestone quarry, which is now a swimming hole. There is great animosity between the cutters and the generally wealthy Indiana University students, each group who have their own turf in town. The dichotomy is that the limestone was used to build the university, which is now seen as being too good for the locals who built it. Although each of the four is a totally different personality from the other three, they also have in common the fact of being unfocused and unmotivated in life. The one slight exception is Dave. Although he has no job and doesn't know what to do with his life, he is a champion bicycle racer. He idolizes the Italian cycling team so much he pretends to be Italian, much to the chagrin of his parents, especially his used car salesman father, Ray Stoller, who just doesn't understand his son. Dave crosses the unofficial line when he meets and wants to date a IU co-ed named Katherine Bennett, who, intrigued by Dave, in turn is already dating Rod, one of the big men on campus. Dave passes himself off to her as an Italian exchange student named Enrico Gismondi. Beyond Katarina as he calls her, Dave's main immediate focus is that the Italian cycling team have announced that they will be in Indianapolis for an upcoming race, which he intends to enter to be able to race his idols. After an incident at the race, Dave, with a little help from his parents and unwittingly by actions of his friends, has to reexamine his life, what he really wants to get out of it and how best to start achieving it.—Huggo Dave and his working-class friends Cyril, Moocher and Mike spend their post-high school days in Bloomington, Indiana, sparring with snooty students from the local university, chasing girls and--in Dave's case--dreaming of competitive bicycle racing. The four friends face opposition from all corners as they decide to make Dave's dreams come true in the university's annual bicycle endurance race.—Jwelch5742 Dave, nineteen, has just graduated high school, with his 3 friends, the comical Cyril, the warm hearted but short-tempered Moocher, and the athletic, spiteful but good-hearted Mike. Now, Dave enjoys racing bikes and hopes to race the Italians one day, and even takes up the Italian culture, much to his friends and parents annoyance. Meanwhile, the 4 friends try to break away from their townie, Indiana reputation while fighting with nearby college snobs.—Carrie W. (dancingchicken2005@hotmail.com) In Bloomington, Indiana, recent high school graduate Dave Stoller (Dennis Christopher) carries a cycling trophy as he walks through the woods with his friends Mike (Dennis Quaid), Cyril (Daniel Stern), and Moocher (Jackie Earle Haley), on their way to swim at an abandoned, water-filled quarry.Later that morning, Dave rides his bike through town, singing in Italian, while his parents, Evelyn (Barbara Barrie) and Ray (Pau Dooley), discuss his recent behavior at breakfast. Ray wants Dave to get a job and move out, but Evelyn defends her son's interest in cycling and remaining at home with his parents, the way Italian people live. Dave returns with his trophy and announces that an Italian cycling team may race in Indiana soon. Ray later pretends Dave is a stranger when he rides past his father's used car lot and shouts hello in Italian.Back at the quarry, Dave and his friends discuss their need to find jobs, hoping to work at the same place. Mike notices several college students from the University of Indiana on the other side of the quarry and becomes upset, suggesting that if they want to infringe upon the locals' territory, he and his friends should take a trip to the college campus. Soon after, they drive to Indiana University and discuss the differences between the rich students and themselves.While they watch the football team practice, Mike recalls his time as a high school quarterback and expresses the frustration he feels when reading newspaper stories about players on the college team. Later, Dave practices Italian on campus and spots a beautiful girl riding a moped. Picking up a book that she dropped, Dave chases her on his bike, and outside the girl's sorority house, he returns the book. Dave introduces himself as ""Enrico,"" an Italian exchange student, and she tells him her name is Katherine (Robyn Douglass).One day, Dave receives a cycling journal in the mail and learns that Team Cinzano, the Italian cyclists, will hold a race in nearby Indianapolis. As Dave rides through town, Cyril runs alongside him, and they discuss a college entrance exam Dave is supposed to take, though he admits he doesn't want to go back to school.One night, Dave stands outside Katherine's sorority and serenades her in Italian while Cyril plays his guitar. Inside the sorority, Katherine's friend Suzy (Pamela Jane Soles) calls Katherine's current boyfriend, Rod (Hart Bocher), to alert him. Meanwhile, Evelyn and Ray have a romantic dinner at home, listening to Italian music. When Dave finishes his song, Katherine rides off with him, leaving Cyril behind. Rod and his friends pull up and run after Cyril, believing he was the one who serenaded Rod's girlfriend. Later, Dave and Katherine return, and she kisses him goodnight.The next day, Mike sees Cyril's bruises and demands to know what happened, but Cyril remains silent about the incident.

Hair,1979,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0079261/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Claude Bukowski leaves the family ranch in Oklahoma for New York where he is rapidly embraced into the hippie group of youngsters led by Berger, yet he's already been drafted. He soon falls in love with Sheila Franklin, a rich girl but still a rebel inside. This movie, based on the cult Broadway musical of the 60s, tells a story about Claude, a young man from Oklahoma who comes to New York City. There he strikes up a friendship with a group of hippies, led by Berger, and falls in love with Sheila, a girl from a rich family. However, their happiness is short because Claude must go to the Vietnam war.—Dragan Antulov <dragan.antulov@altbbs.fido.hr> Hair is a musical focusing on the lives of two young men in the Vietnam era against the backdrop of the hippie culture.Set in the late 1960s, Claude Hooper Bukowski (John Savage) is a naive Oklahoman sent off to see the sites of New York before beginning his enlistment in the US Army. On his arrival he observes a group of hippies lead by George Berger (Treat Williams) begging for change from a trio of horseback riders. Later, Claude catches the runaway horse the hippies have rented and uses it to show off his riding skills to one of the trio of strangers--an upper class débutante. While returning the horse to the hippies, Claude accepts their invitation to be shown around the city.In the course of a single evening, Claude gets stoned smoking marijuana and then is introduced to the race and class issues of the 1960's. The morning after, George finds a scrap of newspaper identifying the mysterious girl. The hippy group, including Hud (Dorsey Wright), Jeannie (Annie Golden) and Woof (Don Dacus), crash a private party where the girl, Sheila Franklin (Beverly D'Angelo), secretly enjoys the disruption of her rigid environment. After the group is arrested, Claude uses the only money he has to pay George's fine so that George can find the funds to get the rest of them released. Meanwhile, at the prison, Woof's refusal to have his hair cut leads into the title song.Unsuccessful at convincing Sheila to get the funds from her father, George returns to his parents' home and is able to convince his mother to give him enough money to have the others released from jail.For their next adventure, the group attends a peace rally in Central Park where Claude drops acid. When Jeannie proposes they get married to keep Claude out of the Army and Sheila shows up to apologize, Claude's ""trip"" reflects his internal conflict over which world he belongs in--his own native Oklahoman farm culture, the upper class society of Sheila or the free-wheeling world of the hippies.When his trip is over, Claude and the hippies have a falling out over both a mean trick they pull on Sheila (taking her clothes while she's skinny-dipping, which then leads to Sheila being completely humiliated when she has no choice but to hail a taxi completely naked) and their philosophical differences over the war in Vietnam and personal versus community responsibility. In the end Claude goes through with his original plan and reports to the draft board. He begins his enlistment in the Army and makes it through basic training.When Claude writes to Sheila from his training camp, she seeks out George and his group to share the news. George begins to cook up a scheme to visit Claude in Nevada at the military base. Enter Hud's finance (Cheryl Barnes), who wants him to return to their life together with his son, LaFayette Jr. (Rahsaan Curry). Tricking Sheila's brother Steve (Miles Chapin) out of the family car, the hippies, Sheila and Hud's finance all head west and try to enter the training camp to visit Claude.Turned back at the guard post, George's next scheme has Sheila chat up Fenton (Richard Bright), an Army Sergeant, at a local bar. Luring him out a back country road with intimations of sex, Sheila helps the group relieve him of his uniform and his car. Using both the car, having his hair cut very short and dressed in Fenton's Army uniform, George infiltrates the Army base, finds Claude and reveals himself. When Claude refuses to leave for fear of being found missing during a headcount, George schemes to take his place long enough for Claude to visit with the others waiting in the desert.While Claude is away, the base, which has been on alert, becomes fully activated with immediate ship-outs to Vietnam. George, unwilling to reveal the Claude is AWOL, boards the plane to Vietnam in Claude's place. Claude arrives too late to slip back into his place.The final scene is at Arlington Cemetery several months later showing George's headstone (he was killed in action in Vietnam) and the song ""Let the Sunshine In"".

In this sequel to American Graffiti, set over the four consecutive New Year's Eve's from 1964 to 1967 depicts scenes from each of these years, intertwined concurrently with one another as though events happen simultaneously. The audience is protected from confusion by the conceit of a distinct cinematic style for each section.Northern California, New Years Eve, 1964. John Milner (Paul LeMat) is now a drag racer. He and his fellow competitors are racing each other for the right to race against the car made by a national racing team known as ""The Factory"". He gets to meet his old school friends Steve Bolander (Ron Howard) and Laurie Henderson (Cindy Williams) whom are now married and Laurie is nine months pregnant and expecting twins. Terry 'The Toad' Fields (Charles Martin Smith) also turns up having joined the U.S. Marines and whom is with his fiancee Debbie Dunham (Candy Clark). John also meets Carol (Mackenzie Phillips) whom has dropped out of high school and is now a hippie drifting around the country in defiance of her parental rules. While John deals with his manager wanting him to win the upcoming championship after he loses his latest match. But John has other complications when Teensa (Mary Kate Place) a former high school girlfriend, leaves behind a non-English speaking foreign exchange student named Eva (Anna Bjorn) whom is from Iceland and John attempts to woo her despite the language barrier.South Vietnam, New Years Eve, 1965. (Note: all of these sequences are shot hand-held on grainy super 16 mm film designed to resemble war reporters' footage.) Terry Fields is serving his tour of duty and sets out trying to wound himself so he can get sent home and be reunited with Debbie, but had a lot of bad luck wanting to do so. After an attempt to shoot himself causes an all-out artillery and airstrike against his location, he deals with his commanding officer, the pompous Major Creech, whom is trying to impress a visiting U.S. Senator.... both of whom appear indifferent to the troop's living conditions and low morale caused by the frequent and unseen enemy ambushes and harassing attacks. Terry is partnered with Little Joe Young (Bo Hopkins) the former gang leader of the Pharaohs back home whom deal with a naive and newbie helicopter pilot, named Lance Sinclair, who seems eager for action, but soon realizes the brutality of the war.San Francisco, California. New Years Eve, 1966. (Note: these sequences echo the movie 'Woodstock' using split screens and multiple angles of the same event simultaneously on screen.) Free-spirited Debbie ""Deb"" Dunham has turned from drinking Old Harper whiskey to smoking marijuana and has given up her platinum blonde persona for a hippie/groupie persona and is now living in a commune with several other hippies including Carol, who has renamed herself 'Rainbow'. Deb and her boyfriend are pulled over in their car where he gets arrested for marijuana possession by a motorcycle cop whom is former drag racer Bob Falfa (Harrison Ford, in an uncredited cameo). As Deb sets about to get bail for her boyfriend, she embarks on a strange surreal acid-induced journey through the city from the strip club where she formerly worked, to the commune, and to a gun-tooting pimp to get the money. As soon as Deb posts her boyfriend's bail, she, Rainbow, and another hippie, named Moonflower, set out to get access to a strange country-western band whom Deb joins on her mystical journey of self discovery.Modesto, California, New Years Eve, 1967. Steve and Laurie Bolander deal with their crumbling marriage. They have money problems, and Laurie wants to help by getting a job, which the sexist and traditional-minded Steve is absolutely against. He says that a mother's place is in the home and will not talk about it anymore. An angry Laurie storms out and goes to her younger brother Andy's apartment. (Note: Laurie's twin brother Curt is said to be living in Canada as a draft dodger). Andy lures Laurie to an anti-war demonstration at a local college campus. Steve sets out to find Laurie and he too gets caught up in the protest which leads into a full-out riot. (Note: these sequences attempt to memorialize the late 1960s with the scenes that recreate the sense and style with references to Haight-Ashbury, the campus peace movement, the beginnings of the modern woman's liberation movement and the accompanying social revolt.) One character burns his draft card triggering the rioting... showing a younger audience what so many Americans had done on the television news ten years before the movie's release. More scenes afterwords show both Steve and Laurie's reactions to the police brutality on the campus demonstrations with billy clubs during the protest.In 1964, John beats everyone, but wrecks his car in the last race. With only a few minutes to make repairs, all of the other teams help John and his team make the repairs and get to the starting line before having to forfeit. He beats the Factory car, and is told by their owner that he has what it takes to go pro. Also, with the help of a groundskeeper acting as a translator for Eva, he managed to tell her how he feels towards her before she leaves. The segment ends with John driving his trademark yellow Deuce at night along a lonely highway toward another vehicle's headlights, and is never seen going further... hinting that the crash was in that vicinity.In 1965, when Terry and Joe's chopper is shot down behind enemy lines and Joe ends up dead from a sniper's bullet to his chest, Terry and the pilot Sinclair, are rescued, but Terry becomes alienated with Major Creech who downplays the events to please the visiting Senator. Later that night, the Creech is cutting a cake made for him and his officers that was presented by Terry. Terry runs to the latrine he is assigned to clean when the cake is cut. Instead of the cake blowing up (as the viewer is led to believe would happen), the latrine blows up. Terry fakes his death in a latrine explosion in which he is declared missing in action. In a gag sequence, the feces from the latrine rain on top of both Major Creech and the Senator who angrily declares, ""this is a dirty war!"" In the final scene, Sinclair meets with Terry in the jungle who gives him the supplies he needs as Terry sets off to hide out in Europe, free from his war duty, but thus never return to the USA (It is never revealed what happened to Terry afterwards if he really did escape from Vietnam).In 1966, Deb goes to a local band to see if they will give her boyfriend a tryout. Newt (Scott Glenn), the leader of the group, is reluctant to do so, but Debbie, Rainbow, and Moonflower tag along to their next gig at a country bar in order to keep convincing Newt. He finally does, but he also begins falling for her. At the gig, Newt puts Debbie in the band as a tambourine player. While performing, she sees her boyfriend at the club dancing erotically with another woman. Debbie jumps off the stage and confronts him. The confrontation eventually leads to a huge bar fight. At the end of the night, Debbie has dumped her boyfriend and is asked to join the band permanently, which he does. She and Newt also begin a relationship.In 1967, Steve and Laurie and all their friends are arrested. When the police begin to abuse Laurie, Steve loses it and begins punching out the cops. He is quickly joined by all of the other arrested protesters and Steve, Laurie, Andy and his girlfriend escape custody. Back home, Steve tells Laurie that he has changed his mind and she can get a job.As with the first American Graffiti movie, the audience is given a last still images of the main cast and what became of them:-John Milner was killed by a drunk driver in December 1964.-Terry Fields was reported missing in action near An Loc in December 1965.-Steve Bolander is an insurance agent in Modesto, California.

Mike manages to shoot out a tire from the car as it arrives at the mortuary which goes out of control. Mike manages to jump out of the car before it hits a tree and explodes, with the Tall Man still inside.Inside the mortuary, Jody is breaking into a crypt of his parents to find if their bodies are still there. Mike enters the building minutes later and sees his parents unearthed coffins and upon opening one, and finds that they are empty. Mike runs and has another encounter with the lethal flying silver sphere, until Jody shows up and destroys the silver sphere with a blast from his shotgun. The two brothers then encounter Reggie, who claims that he made it to the mortuary and has been hiding in a coffin for the past few hours. Reggie also claims to have found the missing girls in a room and freed them.Mike, Jody, and Reggie then go into another room which is a large open area, filled with storage barrels containing several dwarfs, as well as two long poles which upon close examination, is the gateway to an alien planet. Mike is briefly sucked through, but saved by Jody and Reggie who pull him back. Mike realizes that the Tall Man is using the corpses as slaves to his alien planet, and they have to be crushed to small size because of the planet's intense gravity and heat. When the lights in the building go off, Mike disappears and Jody sets off to find him.Alone in the small room, Reggie decides on a gamble to shut down the humming two-pronged gateway by slamming his hands on the tops of the poles, creating a vacuum which he barely escapes. Outside the mortuary, Reggie encounters the woman in lavender, who stabs him to death with the dagger. Mike and Jody come upon the scene and discover the woman in lavender, who changes into the Tall Man, yet another replica. Mike and Jody are forced to run as the mortuary glows and is apparently destroyed.Back home, Mike and Jody, distraught over the death of Reggie, and that the entire town is either dead or consumed by the gateway vacuum, plot on a way to stop the Tall Man by trapping him in a mine shaft since there seems to be no way of killing him. While Jody sneaks out of the house to go to a remote area near a mine shaft to prepare the trap, the Tall Man arrives at the house and attacks Mike who is forced to run. The chase leads to the mine where the Tall Man falls through a fake ground into the hole and to the bottom where Joey pushes a large boulder to seal the hole, thus trapping the Tall Man.After doing so successfully, Mike suddenly wakes up with a start in his house. Mike is next seen lying by the fireplace with the alive-and-well Reggie sitting next to him.Reggie tells Mike he was simply having a bad dream, something that has been a common occurrence since Jody died in a car crash a few weeks earlier. Mike realizes that Jody is indeed dead as well as his parents... all of whom died in the car accident, and the whole thing with the Tall Man was nothing but his horrible nightmare. Reggie suggests that they go away for a while, and Mike agrees.Mike goes into his room to pack his stuff where the Tall Man is waiting for him behind his door. After Mike is shocked to see the Tall Man behind his door, several arms of the dwarf minions pulls Mike through his bedroom window as he screams...."
The Onion Field,1979,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0079668/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"An LA police officer is murdered in the onion fields outside of Bakersfield. However, legal loopholes could keep his kidnappers from receiving justice, and his partner is haunted by overwhelming survivor's guilt. Gregory Ulas Powell is a disturbed ex-con who recruits Jimmy Lee ""Youngblood"" Smith, a petty thief, as his partner in crime. Powell panics one night when the two of them are pulled over by a pair of cops for broken brake lights. Powell decides to kidnap the cops, and Smith, as always, reluctantly goes along with Powell's crazy scheme. The group drives out to a deserted onion field in Bakersfield, California, and one officer is shot while the other escapes. The remainder of the film explores the nature of the American justice system, as well as the devastating psychological effects of this event, and the trial on the surviving officer.—Tad Dibbern <DIBBERN_D@a1.mscf.upenn.edu> Two new partnerships have a fateful encounter late one evening in Los Angeles in early 1963. Patrolling, Los Angeles Police Department Detectives Ian Campbell and Karl Hettinger pull over what they consider a vehicle carrying two suspicious looking men. Those two men are Greg Powell and Jimmy Smith aka Jimmy Youngblood, who indeed are petty crooks - although Powell is more of a minor thug - and who were on their way to commit the latest in a string of robberies. This encounter escalates to a standoff culminating in an onion field outside of Bakersfield, where one of the four is shot dead. Beyond the shooting, the evening does not end as any of the men would have envisioned when the encounter began. In the aftermath of this event, the three survivors recount the activities of the evening in the trial into the shooting and in their everyday lives, the most contentious issue being what happened immediately following the firing of the initial shot. In recounting the event, they contemplate what went wrong and what they would have done differently if given the chance again. That evening has a profound effect on the lives of the three survivors, who have problems emotionally dealing either with what happened that evening or the consequences of their actions that evening, especially in the issue of if the justice system was indeed just both in its process and outcome.—Huggo In Los Angeles in 1963, police officers Karl Hettinger and Ian Campbell stop a car with two suspicious looking men inside. The two, Greg Powell and Jimmy Lee Smith, are in fact small-time hoods who rob liquor and convenience stores for relatively small amounts of cash. The hoodlums take the two policeman prisoner and drive them out to an onion field in Bakersfield California. There, Campbell is killed while Hettinger escapes. Greg Powell is quickly arrested and blames the shooting on Jimmy. There begins a legal saga that will stretch out over many years. Although originally convicted and sentenced to death, both Powell and Smith successfully appeal leading to re-trial after re-trial. Karl Hettinger meanwhile feels that he was somehow responsible for his partner's death and should have been able to do more. He's an emotional wreck and begins to shoplift eventually being caught and forced to resign. Based on true events.—garykmcd"

(This is not explained in this film but in the sequel, Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior.) Central to the plot is a poorly-funded national police unit called the Main Force Patrol (MFP, derogatorily called ""The Bronze"" by their enemies), which struggles to protect the Outback's few remaining townspeople from violent motorcycle gangs. The MFP's ""top pursuit man"" is a young police officer, Max Rockatansky (Mel Gibson), badge number MFP4073.A member of one of the motorcycle gangs, Crawford Montazano (nicknamed ""The Nightrider""), escapes from police custody by killing an officer and stealing his vehicle. MFP officers pursue the Nightrider in a high-speed chase that results in several serious wrecks. Among those involved is a cocky motorcycle cop nicknamed Goose (Steve Bisley), who radios Max.

Meanwhile, they vandalize property, steal fuel, and terrorize the citizenry. While chewing up a town where the Nightrider's remains arrived by train, the gang brutalizes a civilian couple that tried escaping to the road; the couple is overtaken, then both of them are raped and the car is wrecked. Max and Goose are informed about the incident and go to the crime scene. They find Toecutter's young protegé, Johnny the Boy (Tim Burns), and the girl from the car in the middle of the wreckage. Johnny's drug-fueled rantings reveal him as a member of Nightrider's gang; Goose looks on Johnny with particular disdain, as his leg was broken during the Nightrider pursuit. However, they do not kill Johnny, but arrest him and drag him away in chains.Johnny is held at the MFP's dilapidated Halls of Justice pending a visit from the Court. However, when the attorneys arrive, Johnny is ordered released: the judge has set Johnny free because no witnesses showed up for the trial. (Without the testimony of witnesses, no charges could be filed; the courts declared ""no contest"" for the case.) A shocked Goose attacks Johnny and must be physically restrained; both Goose and Johnny shout threats of revenge at each other. The second-in-command of the biker group, Bubba Zanetti (Geoff Parry) arrives at the courthouse to pick up Johnny, on orders from the Toecutter. Bubba does so begrudgingly, because he hates Johnny for his rowdiness, lack of style and drug addiction, and hates the Toecutter's favoritism towards Johnny.Shortly thereafter, Johnny the Boy sabotages Goose's MFP motorcycle while Goose is shacked up with a singer he met at a cabaret. His rear wheel locks up at high speed the next day, throwing Goose from the bike; Goose, however, survives without even suffering ""road rash"". Goose borrows a ute to haul his bike back to civilization. Unfortunately, Johnny ambushes Goose, throwing a brake drum through the ute's windshield, causing Goose to roll the vehicle over, Gas leaks from the fuel tank, soaking the ground around the truck; Johnny, at the belligerent urging of the Toecutter himself, then burns Goose alive in the wreckage.

He takes a road trip with his wife and infant son in the relatively peaceful coastal area north of their home.While on holiday, Max's wife, Jessie, (played by Joanne Samuel) runs into Toecutter's gang, who harass her. She escapes, but the gang manages to track her to the farm where she and Max are staying. Jessie and her son are run down by the gang, who leave their crushed bodies in the middle of the road. Max arrives too late to intervene. His son is pronounced dead on the scene, while his wife suffers massive injuries. (It is revealed in Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior that she later died from her injuries.)Filled with obsessive rage, Max once again dons his police outfit, straps on his sawn-off shotgun, and steals a supercharged black Pursuit Special to pursue the gang. He methodically hunts down and kills the gang members: several gang members are forced off a bridge at high speed while others spill their bikes; Max shoots Bubba off his cycle with his shotgun (Bubba shoots Max in the leg with a pistol first, though, giving Max a limp that is consistent throughout the series, then runs over his exposed arm). Max struggles back into his car and pursues the Toecutter into a forbidden area. Max forces the gang's leader into the path of a speeding tractor trailer and he is crushed in a head-on collision.Max later finds Johnny the Boy taking the boots off a dead driver at the scene of a crash. Johnny desperately tries to convince Max that the man was dead when he found him and that his drug addiction has made him mentally unbalanced. Max doesn't listen and handcuffs Johnny's ankle to the wrecked, overturned vehicle with a ruptured petrol tank. Max lights a crude time-delay fuse and gives Johnny a hacksaw, leaving him the choice of sawing through either the handcuffs (which will take 10 minutes) or his ankle (which will take 5 minutes), and then drives off into the desolate outback, ignoring Johnny's frantic ramblings. The camera shows Max's car from the front, with a large and fiery explosion in the distance behind it, leaving Johnny's fate unknown. Max blankly continues to drive in a rainstorm into the Outback, a shell of his former self."

She books into a hotel as Mrs. Neele. Fiction: A US reporter looks for her and investigates. A fictional account of the real life, eleven day, never explained 1926 disappearance of famed murder mystery writerAgatha Christieis presented. On a cold winter day, her damaged car with her expensive fur coat is found abandoned at the side of a country road. While the authorities initially suspect that she could have committed suicide, her pompous husband, Col. Archibald Christie, who is less than cooperative with the authorities, is adamant that she is still alive. What he doesn't tell them is that he recently asked her for a divorce so that he could marry his secretary, Miss Nancy Neele. Although the divorce request was not a total surprise since she knew of the extramarital affair, Mrs. Christie still did not want to grant him the request since she still loves him. Concurrently, American newspaper columnist Wally Stanton was scheduled to conduct an interview with Mrs. Christie. Since he can no longer do so with her disappearance, Stanton instead tries to find out himself what happened to her. He manages to track her to a resort spa hotel in Harrogate, she who is living openly there but under an assumed name, and he who does not disclose his own identity to her when he meets her. Stanton's goal is not only to find out what she is up to, but to protect her good name which means not allowing the authorities to find her before he uncovers her motives. Stanton's own motives end up being more than just wanting an exclusive story.—Huggo The movie starts when Agatha Christie's husband tells her he wants a divorce, as he fell in love with his secretary, Nancy Neele, and wants to marry her. Agatha pleads for him to stay with her, to no avail. She is very upset and drives away in the dark, swerves to avoid a dog on the road and plants her vehicle against a tree. In the morning her car is found, empty, and a massive search is initiated by the police. Rumors galore, the affair of the husband is common knowledge: the wife is always the last to know. Agatha shows up incognito at the Royal Bath passing through Harrogate station. It so happens that a famous American author is in the country who is somewhat of a detective himself; he tracks Agatha down at the spa, checks in at the same hotel and pursues her, as a suitor. Agatha, now calling herself Theresa Neele, is not interested as she is still in love with her husband. It seems too much of a coincidence when the competition, Nancy Neele, apparently also is taking in the baths. An Agatha Christie worthy story develops when people go about their way in mysterious ways and the suspicion is raised that a dead body might turn up after all, but who will it be? This is a charming movie that portrays Christie as a vulnerable and rather awkward author in a traditional marriage.—Johanna van Zanten Agatha Christie, a new mystery writer, is the toast of London but with her personal life in ruins she disappears to escape all the press and publicity. The film tells of what might have happened during the real life 11 day disappearance of the 'Queen of Crime.'—Tonyman 5 In real life, mystery writer Agatha Christie disappeared for 11 days in December 1926. To this day, no one knows the details of what she did during that time. The film gives a fictional account of Christie's time away, showing her as a woman fleeing her own life after the death of her mother and the announcement from her husband that he is leaving her. She flees to a spa in Harrogate. With the whole country looking for her, an American reporter finds her and ultimately tries to help her."

The early partnership of outlaws Robert LeRoy Parker and Harry Alonzo Longabaugh, better known as Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, in the late nineteenth century American frontier is told. Just paroled from a Wyoming prison on a vow to the state's Governor, affable and otherwise honorable Butch returns to his old stomping grounds of Brown's Hole, Utah, where he meets Longabaugh in a casino shootout gone wrong, the event initiated by Longabaugh.

Despite wanting some notoriety both as an outlaw but also as an all 'round good guy who deserves some respect, Butch is trying to ween himself off criminal activities largely for the sake of his wife Mary and their two young sons, while Sundance is heading in the opposite direction wanting to commit as much lucrative crime as they can muster.

Regardless, the goings-on of the war may override any of their immediate wishes.—Huggo It is 1943 and streams of American soldiers are stationed in England awaiting orders for the D-Day Invasion, the end of World War II. Three soldiers and their involvement with three English women of different social classes metaphorically represent the larger relationship between England and America. The main story is about American Sgt. Matt Dyson (Richard Gere), and British girl Jean Moreton (Lisa Eichhorn). Dyson is a cook whose ambition is to return to America and establish a chain of Motels, whereas Jean seems satisfied to wait for her childhood boyfriend Ken (Derek Thompson) to return so they can start a family and a life together.

The Americans experience a certain prejudice from the English and this reaches a climax at a New Year's dance where some of the White English women dance with some of the Black American Soldiers resulting in a brawl that leaves the couples at odds with each other. The American attitude voiced by Danny seems to be stick with your own kind, whereas the British attitude voiced by Jean is no one should be an outcast because of skin color. Eventually word comes that the war has ended and the Americans leave behind mixed memories of their stay."

Winter Kills,1979,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080139/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The younger brother of an assassinated US President is led down a rabbit hole of conspiracies and dead ends after learning of a man claiming to be the real shooter. Nineteen years after President Timothy Kegan (John Warner) was assassinated, his brother Nick (Jeff Bridges) discovers a dying man claiming to have been the gunman. While trying to avoid his wealthy and domineering father's attempts to control his actions, Nick follows the clues that have been handed to him. As he progresses, it becomes increasingly difficult to discern the real trails from the dead ends, and increasing dangerous as unknown parties try to stop Nick from uncovering the truth.—Jean-Marc Rocher <rocher@fiberbit.net> On board his millionaire father's tanker ship, Nick Kegan (Jeff Bridges) phones his lover, Yvette Malone (Belinda Bauer), and leaves a message on her answering machine. Just then, a family associate named Keifetz (Richard Boone) arrives on the ship by helicopter with a man wrapped in bandages. Inside the ship's doctor's office, the injured man, Arthur Fletcher (Joe Spinell), mutters a confession as an orderly transcribes; Fletcher had assassinated Nick's half-brother, the President of the United States, 19 years ago on February 22, 1960 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania while President Kegan was riding in an open limo with his wife. Fletcher claims that he and one other gunman were hired by a man named Casper, Jr., for the job, after which Fletcher hid his rifle in Room 903 of the Engleson Building in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Fletcher claims that he is confessing because he waned to be able to prove that he was the real killer. Nick inquires about Willie Arnold, the assassin who was determined to be the lone gunman by the Pickering Commission. However, Fletcher dies before he can answer, so Nick heads to Philadelphia to look for the rifle.At the Engleson Building, Nick uncovers the weapon, but, just as he and his companions prepare to leave, a young woman on a bicycle (Barbara Richert) with an infant child rides past their vehicle and pops her chewing gum. In an instant, Nick's associates are shot dead by an unseen sniper. Panicked, Nick runs to call his father, Pa Kegan (John Huston), but instead is connected to John Cerruti (Anthony Perkins), the mastermind behind the Kegan empire. When Nick reports the incident and his whereabouts, Cerruti promises to send help, but the vehicle and the rifle inside are stolen by an unseen person as Nick waits.Sometime later, Nick is chauffeured to Pa Kegan's desert estate, where he is greeted by the Japanese butler, Keith (Toshirô Mifune). Later that evening, Nick sees his emotionally unstable mother, Emma (Dorothy Malone), and is rebuked by his father for leaving the ship. When Nick reports Fletcher's confession and the incident in Philadelphia, his father storms away. However, Pa wakes Nick in the morning with a plan to expose the assassination conspiracy.A few days later, Pa sends Nick to meet his former political rival and one of the richest men in the U.S., Z.K. Dawson (Sterling Hayden). Driving into Dawson's Tulsa, Oklahoma, ranch, Nick is cornered by WW II tanks. Dawson surfaces from a hatch, arguing that he was not involved with the assassination and implicating the Philadelphia Police Departments Captain Heller and his sidekick, Ray Doty.On an airplane to New York City, Nick receives a call from Pa, who reports that they no longer have any witnesses to Fletcher's confession; Keifetz was killed and the ship's orderly broke his neck in a fall.Sometime later, Nick meets Ray Doty (Michael Thomas), who remembers that the man implicated in Fletcher's confession, Casper, Jr., was connected to the Philadelphia police through a nightclub owner named Joe Diamond (Eli Wallach). According to Doty (in a long flashback sequence to 1960), Diamond bribed Captain Heller (Brad Dexter) for access into the police station so he could kill Willie Arnold after the presidential assassination. Gangster Gameboy Baker (Ralph Meeker) arranged the assassination because the president did not return favors for the mafia's $2 million campaign contribution and Arnold was their scapegoat. Joe Diamond was arrested and later died in prison from cancer nearly 10 years after the Kegan assassination.Sometime after his meeting with Doty, Nick returns to New York City and makes love to Yvette. In the throes of passion, the young woman agrees to marry him but later retracts her promise, claiming that Nick is more intimate with her answering machine. When Nick returns home to his nearby apartment, he is attacked by his maid, but he gains the upper hand and has her detained.At lunch the next day at a fancy restaurant, Nick asks Yvette to help him track down people who knew Joe Diamond through National Magazine, the magazine for which she works. Soon, Yvette directs Nick to a Cleveland, Ohio, diner, where he meets gangster Irving Mentor (Irving Selbst) and bribes him for information. Mentor reports that Casper, Jr., figured in the assassination because he was connected to a Hollywood studio that lost $50 million when one of their stars killed herself over an alleged affair with the president. Just then, the same mysterious woman on the bicycle who popped her chewing gum before the shootings in Philadelphia brings a dead cat into Mentor's diner and Nick chases after her as the restaurant explodes, killing Mentor and his henchmen. The unknown woman again gets away.Nick returns to New York City, where Pa debunks Mentor's story and orders Nick to meet with imprisoned gangster Frank Mayo (Tomas Milian), who was given special leave for the interview. When Mayo suggests that Nick is being misled, Nick heads to National Magazine headquarters and learns that Yvette is not actually an employee. Later, the hostile doorman (Joe Ragno) at Yvette's apartment building insists to Nick that no woman with the name of Yvette lives there.Returning home to his apartment, Nick finds Keifetz, who admits that he faked his death and encourages Nick to use Cerruti's intelligence connections to find Yvette. At Pa's financial headquarters, Cerutti tells Nick that Yvette was kidnapped by Casper Jr., and recounts a new version of the assassination. According to Cerruti (in another flashback sequence to the late 1950s), a Washington, D.C. madam named Lola Comante (Elizabeth Taylor), who obliged the president's fondness for sex, offered him a $2 million campaign contribution from Mayo and his mafia associates. When the president discovered that Pa was behind the deal, he ended their relationship, leaving Pa financially and emotionally devastated.Changing the story yet again, Cerruti confesses that he arranged for Nick to meet a fraudulent Z.K. Dawson in Tulsa. The real Dawson and his daughter, Yvette, were the true perpetrators of the assassination; Yvette, formerly known as Maggie Dawson, was the president's mistress. Nick discounts Cerruti's story and insists on learning Yvette's whereabouts. As Nick attacks and fractures Cerruti's arms with a baton, he breaks down. Cerutti claims that Pa spent millions of dollars to support his son's presidency because it benefited him financially, but he was displeased by the president's liberal politics and so it was Pa who had him killed. Pa created an elaborate hoax to confuse Nick, including the employment of an actress named Jenny O'Brien to play the role of Yvette. When Cerruti says that Jenny is ""tied up"" at Kegan Medical School, Nick leaves... only to find her body in the morgue.Sometime later, Nick confronts his father in his office, but Pa claims that Cerruti masterminded the assassination to augment the Kegan coffers and blackmailed Pa into keeping quiet. When Nick attempts to call the police, Keifetz and an officer break into Pa's office and Nick thinks the men are there to back him up; however, Pa announces that Keifetz is an assassin with orders to kill Nick. Defending himself, Nick grabs the officer and uses his gun to fire at Keifetz, who shoots back at the officer as he dies. Nick chases his father onto the high-rise balcony and finds Pa clinging to the rail of an enormous American flag. As Nick reaches for his father, Pa falls to his death, tearing the flag in half with his body as he calls out to Nick: ""put my money in South America!"". Nick staggers away, but tells the secretary that he will return because he cannot escape his family ties.Sometime later in the final scene, Nick calls Yvette's answering machine to hear her voice one last time."

Cuba,1979,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0079013/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A British mercenary arrives in pre-Revolution Cuba to help train General Batista's Army against Castro's guerrillas while he also romances a former lover now married to an unscrupulous plantation owner. In the late 1950s, a British hireling is sent to Cuba to train Batista's army. They must be trained to fight Castro's army. While there, the Brit encounters an old love, who is married. While Castro's army wins more and more, their love revives.—R. Kessen <rhkessen@cs.vu.nl> When British ex-Army officer Robert Dapes arrives in Cuba to advise the Batista government on fighting the revolutionaries, he realizes that the cause is already lost, with well organized rebels constantly gaining ground against poorly trained government troops. His difficulties are compounded when he runs into Alexandra, the love of his life who has settled for a comfortable marriage which is now threatened by the revolution and by the exploits of her philandering husband.—J-26 In December 1958, former British military officer and counter-insurgency specialist, Major Robert Dapes (Sean Connery), arrives in Havana, Cuba, as a mercenary. He has been hired by General Bello (Martin Balsam) on behalf of the military dictator General Fulgencio Batista (Wolfe Morris) to help the Cuban army defeat Fidel Castro's rebellion. Arriving on the same flight is American investor, Larry Gutman (Jack Weston), who is met outside the terminal by elegant businesswoman, Alexandra Pulido (Brooke Adams). Passing by, Robert thinks he recognizes her as a former lover, but her chauffeured car drives away as he calls out to her. Captain Ramirez (Hector Elizondo), Robert's military escort, informs him that she is married to a member of Cuba's oldest and wealthiest families, the Pulidos.From the airport, Alexandra takes Gutman to the cigar factory she manages. In her absence, Juan Pulido (Chris Sarandon), Alexandra's philandering husband, is involved in a continuing his affair with factory worker Therese Mederos (Lonette McKee), and when Alexandra returns to the office, she notices a flirtatious exchange between them. While Juan escorts Gutman through the plant, Alexandra fires Therese. To impress Gutman, Juan shows him the scope of his family's business, encompassing tobacco, sugar, and rum, and then introduces him to his father, the tycoon Don Jose Pulido (Walter Gotell). Don Jose informs Gutman that his daughter-in-law Alexandra is the real executive of the cigar factory while his son Juan would rather be a playboy. When Alexandra announces that she dismissed Therese, Juan appears unconcerned and promises to refrain from dallying with the staff. Gutman then leaves and meets with British executive Donald Skinner (Denholm Elliott) who is looking for Gutman's representation to buy up more sugar field land in Cuba to open a sugar factory.Meanwhile, Ramirez takes Robert to a luxurious, modern hotel, but Robert chooses to stay in less conspicuous, modest accommodations at a local seedy hotel. After settling in, Robert meets with General Bello and emphasizes that strategy rather than weapons will subdue the rebels. As the general grants him exclusive security clearance, Robert warns Bello that Castro will be difficult to defeat if the people are on his side.While visiting a military barracks, Robert sees the woman from the airport again and realizes that she is ""Alex."" Robert interrupts her tennis game to say hello, but she discourages his greeting, stating that she is married now.During a reconnaissance patrol, Robert helps capture a rebel soldier as well as enemy documents. Despite this small gain, Ramirez tells Robert that he might have arrived too late to help the Cuban army win the larger battle.That evening, the rebels ambush a formal dinner party hosted by General Bello and kill several high-society guests. Robert and Ramirez arrive immediately after the shooting and assist the wounded until ambulances arrive.Elsewhere in the city, Julio Mederos (Danny De La Paz), an ambitious young teenage rebel fighter, prepares to kill Juan Pulido for betraying his sister, Therese, but she tries to dissuade her brother. Meanwhile, at the Flamingo nightclub during a Christmas Eve party, Alexandra is angry with Juan for assuming that she would share a table with Gutman's companion, a prostitute. When Robert arrives, she joins him at the bar, recalling fond memories of their passionate affair 15 years ago. Robert is about to warn her of the recent massacre, but is interrupted by Juan's appearance. As Alexandra introduces the two men, Robert notices Julio aiming a gun at them, reacts quickly, and they dodge the bullet. Ramirez runs after Julio, but is unable to catch him. After assisting the police investigation, Robert returns to the nightclub and finds Alexandra waiting for him. As dawn breaks, the former lovers stroll through Havana and reminisce. After sharing a kiss, they return to Robert's hotel room and make love. Meanwhile, Juan is busy carousing with Therese.Elsewhere in Havana, Castro's intelligence agent, Nunez (Roger Lloyd Pack), criticizes Julio for attempting an unnecessary assassination on Pulido. The agent tells the brash rebel that if he wants to kill, he should target someone more valuable and shows a photograph of Major Robert Dapes.That morning, Rivero Agüero, a candidate backed by Batista, is announced as the new President of Cuba. At breakfast, Alexandra informs Robert that Agüero was not elected by the Cuban people, but was chosen by Batista in a rigged election. Recognizing that Alexandra is unhappy in her marriage, Robert invites her to leave Cuba with him. However, she reminds Robert that she has responsibilities at the factory and that she enjoys her luxurious lifestyle. As their conversation turns into an argument, she leaves.Meanwhile, rebels call for a nationwide strike on the radio, in protest of the rigged election. At the Pulido cigar factory, Alexandra is unable to prevent workers from leaving as the streets of Havana fill with protesters. Elsewhere, Cuban army soldiers detain Julio, along with other bus passengers, at a military checkpoint. As Ramirez and Robert arrive at the same barrier, Julio withdraws his concealed gun and fires at the soldiers. During his escape, Julio aims at Robert, but he accidentally kills Ramirez instead.Robert then goes to the deserted cigar factory looking for Alexandra and finds Julio with a gun to her head. Threatening to kill Alexandra, Julio orders Robert to drive the three of them to Castro's camp where Julio hopes to prove his worth as a revolutionary by handing over valuable hostages. Along the way, Castro's guerrillas intercept the car. Alexandra and Robert are taken to a gasoline depot that has just been captured by the rebels and are detained with Cuban army soldiers. Unlike the thug Julio, Carrillo (Tony Mathews), one of the rebel leaders, does not want to kill the captives, but instead wants to convert them and win the revolution through strategy. When General Bello and his army counterattack to regain the depot using an armored train, Robert, now fully alienated with the government that hired him, tries to aide the rebels, realizing that the revolution is on the verge of toppling Batista's corrupt government. In a climatic gun battle, Robert commandeers a government tank and opens fire on the government troops. Many government soldiers and rebels are killed or wounded in the battle. Carrillo is wounded in his right leg by shrapnel, but Alexandra manages to tend to his wound. Gutman even joins in on the fighting by manning a heavy .50 caliber machine gun. Gutman shoots up at a twin-engine plane, thinking that it's a government bomber, but it is a charter flight piloted by Donald Skinner, who manages to fly the damaged plane away from Cuba to land safely in Miami, Florida. The end result of the battle is the rebels defeat the Cuban military and capture many government troops, including General Bello.Later on New Years Day, Robert drives Alexandra home and tells Juan that he is taking her away from Cuba now that Fidel Castro will becoming to power. However, Alexandra argues that she feels like a pawn between the two men, and declares that she wants to remain in Cuba, asking Robert to stay with her. Frustrated, Robert leaves to make arrangements for departure, hoping that Alexandra will change her mind and meet him at the airport. As Alexandra drives her sports car to escape, Juan continues to indulge and behave as if nothing will change, but the teenage rebel Julio sneaks onto the property and shoots him dead in the swimming pool.Later, at the airport, Robert, Gutman, and other foreigners, wait in the departure lounge for the last flights out of Cuba and watch as Batista and Don Jose Pulido easily flee the country on private planes. Before boarding, Robert leaves a ticket at the gate for Alexandra. She arrives in time, but instead of joining him, she watches as his plane prepares for departure. Tearful, she returns to Havana alone to face an unknown future without Robert and her late husband Juan. In the city, a large crowd of cheering Cubans welcome Fidel Castro to power.The film closes with the caption 'Cuba, 1959' as the end credits roll over the Cuban flag."

Stalker,1979,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0079944/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A guide leads two men through an area known as the Zone to find a room that grants wishes. In a small, unnamed country there's an area called the Zone. It's an unusual area, and within its a place known as the Room, where it's believed wishes are granted. The government declared The Zone a no-go area and have sealed it off. This hasn't stopped people from entering the Zone. A writer, and a professor, want to reach the Zone. Their guide - a man known as a stalker, has a special relation with the Zone.—grantss Two men and their guide, a 'stalker', travel through a mysterious and forbidden territory in the wilderness called 'the zone."" In the zone, nothing is what it seems. In the zone, there's said to be a bunker, which contains: a 'magical' room, where people who make wishes...come true. Only by following the Stalker's lead can the two men hope to make it to the bunker - and the room. As they travel, they realise it may take something more than just determination to succeed. In the heart of the bleak and barren Zone--an out-of-bounds wilderness, and the cancerous epicentre of an unspeakable tragedy--lies the mystical location people refer to only as ""The Room"". Imbued with the unfathomable capacity for granting one's impatient wishes, two men, the Writer and the Professor, enlist the help of the altruistic guide, Stalker, to visit the restricted area. In high hopes of finding inspiration and enlightenment, the ambitious dreamers stick to their experienced tracker until they arrive at the alleged source of metaphysical power; however, are they worthy of the ultimate truth?—Nick Riganas Near a gray and unnamed city is the Zone, an alien place guarded by barbed wire and soldiers. Over his wife's objections, a man rises in the early morning and leaves her with their disabled daughter to meet two men. He's a Stalker, one of a handful who have the mental gifts (and who risk imprisonment) to lead people into the Zone to the Room, a place where one's secret hopes come true. His clients are a burned out popular writer, cynical, and questioning his talent; and a quiet scientist more concerned about his knapsack than the journey. In the deserted Zone, the approach to the Room must be indirect. As they draw near, the rules seem to change and the stalker faces a crisis.—<jhailey@hotmail.com> A ""stalker"" is a guide who takes people through ""The Zone,"" a place located outside an unidentified city, the result of an extra-terrestrial incursion. The State has closed it off from the outside world with barbed wire and it is closely guarded by armed police and soldiers. Inside The Zone there is ""The Room,"" which is said to grant ones deepest wish to anybody who enters it.""Stalker"" opens with the credits rolling on the background showing of a shabby bar. An atmosphere of despair is reinforced by a strange electronic music. Soon after, Professor Wallace tells about the sudden appearance nearby of a miracle of miracle: The Zone.The next scene shows a dingy room where three figures, a man, a woman, and a child, are asleep together in a wrought iron bed. Next to the bed is a pair of crutches. The man slowly gets up, dresses, goes to the kitchen sink and washes himself. The woman, his wife (Alisa Frejndlikh), joins him and scolds him for returning to his old ways, which will surely land him back in jail. The man argues briefly for her to let him go, that he must go, and he finally pushes her aside and leaves the room. As he leaves, his wife curses the day she ever met him and reproaches him for having begotten such a child. She falls to the ground, weeping.The man, Stalker (Aleksandr Kajdanovsky), goes to the waterfront to meet with a couple, a well-dressed woman and a man, Writer (Anatoli Solonitsyn). He rudely dismisses the woman and, together with Writer, walks back to the bar shown in the opening of the film, where a third man, Professor (Nikolai Grinko), is waiting for them. No sooner as these two men meet that they start bickering with each other. Stalker will guide these two men through The Zone. Writer explains that the reason for his trip is to recover his lost inspiration while Professors motivation is purely scientific curiosity.Stalker and the two men leave the bar for their dangerous mission into The Zone. They drive through a desolate urban landscape of broken down and abandoned buildings, littered potholed streets, carefully avoiding police patrols. After sometime, sneaking behind a train, they enter through open gates the buffer area of The Zone. They hide for a while, and following the train again through another check-point, and all the while being shot at, they penetrate into The Zone itself. Having taken refuge in an abandoned building, they regroup, and Stalker sends Writer ahead to look for a railway flatbed car, which will take them inside The Zone itself. Writer loses in nerves and turns around right away, having second thoughts about continuing the trip, so Professor calmly volunteers for the mission.All three men journey on the flatbed car silently and solemnly through changing landscape in a single three-and-a-half minute odyssey to the The Zone. As they reach, the film turns from sepia color to full color. There is a striking contrast between the lush green, but littered landscape of The Zone and the dilapidated surroundings previously encountered. The atmosphere is still except for the calls of cuckoo birds heard in the far. ""There we are... home, at last,"" says Stalker and proceeds to talk about another stalker, his mentor, Porcupine. Before absenting himself for a while, Stalker hands Professor some white cloth and some steel nuts and tells him to tie a piece of this gauze to each of the nuts. During his absence, Professor relates the story of Porcupine and of The Zone. When Stalker rejoins the group, their journey through The Zone begins, with Stalker every so often throwing one of the nuts to indicate the path to follow. All along, Stalker relates how dangerous and tricky The Zone is, and that it demands respect. Rules that apply outside The Zone are no longer valid inside it. For example, the shortest path between two points is no longer a straight line, but a convoluted path. As they soon arrive in view of The Room, Writer rebels against this rule and proceeds straight on toward The Room, but stops short when he hears a voice warning him: ""Stop, don't move."" Writer returns precipitously to Stalker and Professor who swear that they had not spoken a word. Professor suggestion that Writer scared himself starts another argument interrupted by Stalker who again reiterates the danger in The Zone, full of deadly traps, and what kind of persons is allowed to enter The Room. Professor now gets apprehensive and refused to go on, but Stalker dissuades him, and the group continues on.Professor, having forgotten his knapsack, wants to go back to fetch it. Stalker tells him it is impossible because it is too dangerous. Stalker and Writer continue their journey, wading knee-deep toward a waterfall. Arriving at the cascade, Stalker notices that Professor is missing. Since it is not possible to retrace ones path in The Zone, they proceed and as they passed through an archway in a tiled wall, they meet a serene Professor having a drink by a fire, with his knapsack nearby, just where he had previously left it. Stalker recognizes this as a trap. Another argument ensues during which Professor and Writer throw biting insults at each other.A long, puzzling and complex scene follows, during which a mysterious dog appears. This long scene is complex in so far as the positions and the spatial relationships between the three characters keep changing in unnatural ways. The background of electronic music adds to the strangeness of the scene. Writer and Stalker talk about the redemptive power of art. A voice-over, that may be Stalkers wife, recites some biblical passage, and so does Stalker.A quick cut shows the group arriving at the ""meat grinder,"" a dark tunnel, dimly lit through hole in the ceiling, and a floor covered with puddles. Writer is designated in a draw to go first, while the rest of the group follows at a safe distance. When Writer reaches a door, he pulls out a pistol, but Stalker convinces him to throw it away. They continue through the door, wadding chest-deep in filthy water, up a stairway, and into a room filled with moguls of sand. Writer, who had proceeded in the wrong direction, standing next to a deep well where he has just dropped a large stone, delivers a long monologue about the emptiness of his life and the meaninglessness of work. Stalkers deliver a poem, which was actually written by Arseny Tarkovsky, about fate.In the following scene, the trio finds itself in one of the small rooms bordering a pool full of refuse, and in which there is a telephone (note that this is not The Room). A heated discussion begins regarding each of the men's real objectives for wanting to reach The Room. Stalker leads the two men through an opening in the wall and stop at the threshold of a brightly illuminated room, and, chocked with emotions, he tells his companions that they are now about to experience the greatest moment in their lives. In The Room, they will be able to fulfill their most sincere wish.Writer refuses to go in first, as he does not want to humiliate himself by prostrating himself. Professor produces a hand held nuclear bomb he had carried all along in his knapsack, as he does not want the power of The Room to be used by the wrong people for the wrong reasons. Stalker struggles with Professor trying to take the bomb away, with Writer intervening several times, tearing Stalker away from the Professor. Writer brings all sorts of accusations against Stalker, questioning his motives and his honesty. To which a tearful Stalker responds that he is a failure and that all the people he brings to The Room are also failures, but he can nevertheless help them. Eventually, Professor takes his bomb apart and throws the pieces in the water. The last scene shows, the three men sitting on the floor, outside The Room, with Writer, his arm over Stalkers shoulder, and Professor leaning against their backs.In the next scene, in black-and-sepia film, we are back into the bar with the trio standing around the table, almost as at the opening of the film. Outside are Stalkers wife and his daughter, Monkey (Natasha Abramova). The wife enters the bar and leaves together with Stalker and the dog, leaving Professor and Writer behind. Stalker is carrying his daughter on his shoulders. They walk along a river with the power plant in the background belching steam.Once at home, Stalker is very depressed, and his wife reassures him of his worth. Direct to the audience, she delivers a long monologue, saying that in spite of all the adversities she has endured over the years, she does not regret having married Stalker. She professes that their marriage was blessed, because if there would have been no sorrow, there could have been no happiness either.The final shot, in color, is an enigmatic one. Monkey is heard in a voice-over reading a poem by Fyodor Tyuchev. She then appears to move through telekinesis three glasses which are on the table. A train passes, rattling The the, its rambling mixing up with segments of Beethoven's ""Ode to Joy,"" as the film fades away on Monkey's vacant face."

The Wanderers,1979,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080117/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The Wanderers is a teenage, Italian gang in Bronx, NYC, 1963. They have their confrontations with other gangs. Drugs and weapons are uncool. Adult life awaits them. The Bronx, 1963. With the radio stations playingThe Four Seasons,Lee Dorsey,The Angels, andBen E. King, Richie Gennaro and The Wanderers, a band of Italian-American greasers, meander through the city's streets, fall in love, and get into trouble. However, graduation day is fast approaching, and whether the Wanderers like it or not, violence is the only way to resolve differences at school and the street. But do the reckless Wanderers know that their carefree days as a gang are numbered?—Nick Riganas Set against the urban jungle of 1963 New York's gangland subculture, this coming of age teenage movie is set around the Italian gang the Wanderers. Slight comedy, slight High School angst and every bit entertaining with its classic 1950's Rock n' Roll soundtrack such as ""Walk Like a Man"", ""Big Girls Don't Cry"" by The Four Seasons and ""My Boyfriend's Back"" by The Angels. Focusing around a football game where the different gangs play with and against each other, then at its grand finale, come together in a mass of union to defend their honour and their turf. Nostalgic stuff and above all a Rock n' Roll retrospective on a grand musical era. Timeless.—Cinema_Fan Set in the Bronx, New York City in the year 1963, the film opens with Richie (Ken Wahl), the leader of an Italian-American street gang called 'The Wanderers' persuades his girlfriend Despie (Toni Kalem) to go ""all the way"" as a World War II Hollywood war movie plays on a TV set. They have sex for the first time.Over the opening credits, we are introduced to ""Baldies"" a 40-strong gang of the most fearsome-looking hooligans, distinguished by their shaved heads and black leather jackets, gathering on a street corner under the command of their and their burly leader, known only as ""Terror"" (Erland Van Lidth) Nearby, Joey (John Friedrich), a feisty member the Wanderers, tries to persuade his friend Turkey (Alan Rosenburg) (who has just shaved his own head) not to join the Baldies. When Joey, being small but foolishly brave, insults the group's appearance, he is heard by Pee Wee (Linda Manz), a teenage tomboy and the sole member of the Baldies Ladies Auxuilary. The Baldies, including Terror and Pee Wee, chase Joey and Turkey who must literally run for their lives. As Joey runs through the streets, he signals the Wanderers for help. Richie along with another Wanderer member, named Buddy (Jim Youngs), appear, but when they see the Baldies, they join Joey and Turkey in flight.Cornered by the Baldies in a back alleyway, the four Wanderers prepare to fight. Suddenly, a tough, confident stranger named Perry (Tony Ganios) appears and intimidates the Baldies. Perry all by himself beats up several of the brawler Baldies forcing them to retreat. Terror then appears and confronts Perry. But after tense silence, to the other Wanderers' surprise, Terror suddenly backs down from fighting Perry and orders his henchmen to withdraw. Perry then leaves before the Wanderers have a chance to thank him.Later that evening, Joey meets Perry once again and learns that he lives right in his apartment building. Perry, a fellow Italian, has recently transferred to the all-boys high school that the Wanderers attend from New Jersey. Joey invites Perry to join the Wanderers and informs him that being a member of a gang is necessary for protection. Both Joey and Perry have trouble at home; Joey is afraid of his abusive and macho father Emilio (William Andrews), while Perry's widowed mother (never seen on-camera) is an alcoholic.In class, Perry watches as an argument escalates between African American and Italian students when their teacher Mr. Sharp (Val Avery) tries to teach them ""brotherhood"" in co-existing with each other. The argument turns violent as Richie, the leader of the Wanderers, agrees to meet gang leader Clinton (Michael Wright) and his African American followers, the ""Del Bombers,"" for a fight on Saturday, but without guns or knives. In the meantime, Richie tries to build an alliance with the violent Irish gang, known as the ""Ducky Boys,"" and the ""Wongs,"" who are the Chinese, but both groups are distrustful of his offer. Although ""Turkey"" was a member of the Wanderers in high school, he admires the Baldies, and, still hoping to join them, he encourages Richie to reach out to the group, but Richie rejects the idea. Later, the Baldies harass Richie and Joey, while Turkey is forced to betray his friends and participate in the bullying.After the incident, Richie accepts an offer of assistance from the local Italian mafia boss owner Chubby Galasso (Dolph Sweet), who is the father of Despie. At his bowling alley, Chubby bashes a group of hustlers in front of Richie to demonstrate his authority, which leaves a chilling impression on the teenager. Instead of fighting the Del Bombers, Chubby tells Richie to settle the matter in a football game, and Chubby and his friends will bet money on the Wanderers, who are undefeated this season. To negotiate the arrangement, Chubby welcomes representatives from the Del Bombers to the bowling alley.Sometime later, Richie, Joey, Perry, and Buddy flirt with women on the sidewalk by bumping into them so they can grab at their breasts. Here, Richie meets Nina (Karen Allen), a young non-Italian teenager who is immediately attracted to Richie. Since Richie has a girl friend, Joey shouts out his telephone number to Nina. The friends follow Nina's car, but they take a wrong turn and arrive in an area controlled by the Ducky Boys. A fight ensues, and Perry's arm is broken by a baseball bat. After returning home that evening, Joey and Perry see Joey's father leaving Perry's mother's apartment... implying that they have been sleeping with each other. However, Joey is thrilled when Nina telephones and wants to join him and the Wanderers for a party, hosted by Despie at her parents' house.At the party that Saturday night, although Richie is captivated by Nina, he encourages best friend Joey to seduce her. In a separate room from the party guests, Richie and Joey play strip poker with Nina and Despie, which the guys cheat at. During the game, Despie notices Richie's interest in Nina and storms away. As soon as they are alone together, Richie and Nina kiss, then they leave to have sex in her car.Meanwhile, the Baldies are at their street corner hangout when in a drunken state, they are observed by a US Marine recruitment sergeant (Burrt Harris) working at an Armed Forces recruitment office. He invites the Baldies into his office and tricks them into joining the Marines, much to Pee Wee's dismay. Now intoxicated and looking to incite a ruckus, the Baldies arrive at the Galasso house and instruct Turkey to go inside and bring back women. As Turkey surprises the party-goers, he is assaulted by Perry. The Baldies, meanwhile, abandon their new recruit and drive away. Outside, Joey is shocked to see Richie seducing Nina in the car. When Richie tries to explain, Joey punches him and walks away, while Despie is tearful and curses her boyfriend.Elsewhere, Turkey runs through the streets to find the Baldies, but he becomes lost and encounters the Ducky Boys who are attending mass at a local church. Turkey then foolishly propositions one of the Ducky Boy leaders who investigates Turkey's shouting. The Ducky Boys then chase Turkey and terrorize him. After climbing up an elevated subway structure, Turkey looses his balance and plunges to his death. Later, at school, Joey mourns Turkey, telling classmates that he will be missed.Meanwhile, the Wanderers continue to ignore Richie for his betrayal of Joey. A few days later, on November 22, 1963, Richie and Despie encounter each other at a storefront, where the news of President Kennedy's assassination unfolds on television, they comfort one another and reconcile. Despie reveals she is pregnant as a result of their one-time sexual encounter. Chubby then confronts the young man and declares that he must take responsibility and marry his daughter and move into their house. Without waiting for a reply, Chubby congratulates Richie and calls him son-in-law.Elsewhere, Joey tries to cope with his abusive father, Emilio, while making a banner for the football game. On the day of the event at Van Courtland Park, the Del Bombers arrive at the stadium with confidence, accompanied by cheerleaders and music. Meanwhile, Richie hides on the sidelines while the Wanderers start the game, and Joey replaces him as quarterback. As the Del Bombers take a commanding lead, Joey becomes frustrated. Richie then arrives on the field, apologizes to his friend and guides the team toward tying the score. Suddenly, a large number of Ducky Boys appear at the stadium, wielding sticks and knives. As spectators flee, the Wanderers and the Del Bombers brace for a fight. Displaying their martial arts skills, the Wongs also enter the melee and assault the Ducky Boys. Joey's brutish father also joins the action. Despite the injuries, the combined alliance of gangs impedes the attack, and the Ducky Boys scramble from the field. In his rage to fight, however, Emilio strikes his son, knocking him to the ground.Afterward, Joey stays with Perry and declares he is never returning home, while Perry shares that his mother is an alcoholic. The two friends plan to drive out of town that night and leave for California to begin a new life. Emilio then arrives at the apartment. When he intimidates his son, Perry defends Joey, and a fight ensues. Joey hits his father on the head with a glass bottle, and the boys flee.Later, the Wanderers, the Del Bombers, and the Wongs surprise Richie with a bachelor party at the restaurant where he works as a dishwasher. Even Pee Wee attends the party, revealing that Terror and all of the Baldies are gone, having left days earlier for Marine boot camp. During the celebration, Chubby offers Richie a job in his organization, and Richie is too afraid to refuse; he will join the ""family business"". Unexpectedly, Richie sees Nina walking past the restaurant and follows her. Through a window, he watches with regret as she meets her parents at a folk song nightclub. Bob Dylan is performing at the club with the song ""The Times They Are a-Changin'"". Accepting that their brief relationship is over, Richie makes his way back to the party.When Richie returns to his bachelor party, Joey and Perry announce that they are leaving town for Los Angeles and say goodbye. Richie is despondent, but he is soon uplifted as the guests sing the song, ""The Wanderer,"" in his honor. The final shot shows Joey and Perry driving away into New Jersey and heading for a new life in California."

When the locals come to know about Harker's plan to visit Count Dracula's castle, they warn Harker to stay away from the castle. They tell tales of Dracula's evil and werewolves to prevent Harker from visiting the castle but to no avail.

His boss, Renfield, informs him that a nobleman named Count Dracula wishes to buy a property in Wismar, and assigns Harker to visit the count and complete the lucrative deal. Leaving his young wife Lucy behind in Wismar, Harker travels for four weeks to Transylvania, to the castle of Count Dracula. He carries with him the deeds and documents needed to sell the house to the Count.On his journey, Jonathan stops at a village, where locals plead for him to stay clear of the accursed castle, providing him with details of Dracula's vampirism. Harker ignores the villagers' pleas as superstition, and continues his journey unassisted ascending the Borgo Pass. Harker arrives at Dracula's castle, where he meets the Count, a strange, ancient, almost rodent-like man, with large ears, pale skin, sharp teeth, and long fingernails.The lonely Count is enchanted by a small portrait of Lucy and immediately agrees to purchase the Wismar property, especially with the knowledge that he and Lucy would become neighbors. As Jonathan's visit progresses, he is haunted at night by a number of dream-like encounters with the vampiric Count. Simultaneously, in Wismar, Lucy is tormented by night terrors, plagued by images of impending doom. Additionally, Renfield is committed to an asylum after biting a cow, apparently having gone completely insane. To Harker's horror, he finds the Count asleep in a coffin, confirming for him that Dracula is indeed a vampire.At night, Dracula leaves for Wismar, taking with him a number of coffins, filled with the cursed earth that he needs for his vampiric rest. Harker finds that he is locked in the castle, and attempts to escape through a window with a makeshift rope.

Lucy later has an encounter with Count Dracula; weary and unable to die, he demands some of the love that she gave so freely to Jonathan, but she refuses, much to Dracula's dismay. Now aware that something other than plague is responsible for the death that has beset her once-peaceful town, Lucy desperately tries to convince the townspeople, but they are skeptical and uninterested. She finds that she can vanquish Dracula's evil by distracting him at dawn, but at the expense of her own life. She lures the Count to her bedroom, where he proceeds to drink her blood.Lucy's beauty and purity distract Dracula from the call of the rooster, and at the first light of day, he collapses to the floor, dead. Van Helsing arrives to discover Lucy, dead but victorious. He then drives a stake through the heart of the Count to make sure Lucy's sacrifice was not in vain.In a final, chilling plot twist, Jonathan Harker awakens from his sickness, now a vampire, and arranges for Van Helsing's arrest for the murder of Count Dracula. He is last seen traveling away on horseback, garbed in the same fluttering black as Dracula, stating enigmatically that he has much to do."
The Brood,1979,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078908/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A man tries to uncover an unconventional psychologist's therapy techniques on his institutionalized wife, amidst a series of brutal murders. A man's wife is under the care of an eccentric and unconventional psychologist who uses innovative and theatrical techniques to breach the psychological blocks in his patients. When their daughter comes back from a visit with her mother and is covered with bruises and welts, the father attempts to bar his wife from seeing the daughter but faces resistance from the secretive psychologist. Meanwhile, the wife's mother and father are attacked by strangely deformed children, and the man begins to suspect a connection with the psychologist's methods.—Ed Sutton <esutton@mindspring.com> Frank Carveth, is becoming more and more worried about the eccentric Dr Hal Raglan's high-handed therapeutic treatment of his troubled ex-wife, Nola, at the remote Somafree Institute of Psycho-Plasmics. After years of research, the controversial therapist has come up with a cutting-edge procedure focusing on the physical manifestations of his patients' symptoms, and mainly, their bottled-up rage; however, the hideous purple-black bruises and the nasty scratches on the back of Frank and Nola's shell-shocked little daughter, Candice, are alarming. Are those intimate mother-and-daughter meetings at the institute dangerous for the poor girl? And what about the string of unexplained brutal murders in town? In the end, are they somehow connected to Somafree's obscure practices?—Nick Riganas At the Somafree Institute, Dr. Hal Raglan humiliates his patient Mike by saying: ""you're just a weak person. You must have got that from your mother. It probably would have been better for you if you had been born a girl!"" On the dimly lit stage, Raglan demands a demonstration of anger, and Mike reveals angry red blotches covering his torso. The audience gasps. Raglan announces that this is psychoplasmcis; the physical manifestation of mental rage by the appearance of the welts on one's body.Meanwhile, Frank Carveth collects his nine-year-old daughter Candy from a 'Private Guest Room'. Candy wears a red coat with fur trim and hood. Bathing her, Frank finds bruises and scratches on her back. He drives to the Somafree Institute to confront Raglan and demands to see his wife Nola, whom has been committed there after she apparently suffered a nervous breakdown. Raglan refuses. Frank accuses Nola of abusing their daughter and says he will stop Candy's next visit. Raglan threatens legal action if Frank withholds a vital part of Nola's treatment. Frank then goes to his lawyer, Al Resnikoff, who tells him that Nola has a stronger legal position despite the fact that she is committed to a mental hospital. Frank says that he will do what he has to. He takes Candy to her maternal grandmother, Juliana, who seems highly strung out.Back at the institute, Raglan goes into Nola's room (play-acting as Candy) and he asks her why she hurt her daughter Candice. Raglan/Candice says: ""Mummies don't hurt their own children"". Nola sobs that they do. She tells Raglan that her own mother was ""fucked up and bad"". Raglan encourages her anger by telling her: ""Go all the way through it, right to the end.""That evening at Juliana's house, she investigates a noise in the kitchen. Food, juice, glasses and dishes are thrown all over the floor. She is bludgeoned by what appears to be a small child wearing a red hooded raincoat with fur trim. As Candy watches from behind a door, small claw-like hands leaves bloodstains on the banisters. The next morning at his workplace, Frank is informed of Juliana's murder. Police psychologist Dr. Birkin tells Frank so encourage Candy to remember what happened, a breakdown is possible if she doesn't remember. ""These things tend to express themselves in one way or another"" says Dr. Birkin.At the institute, Raglan speaks to Nola as her father. She quickly gets very angry saying: ""You shouldn't have walked way when she hit me."" Red welts appear on Nola's forehead as she speaks.At the local airport, Frank and Candy meet Barton Kelly, Nola's estranged father, who has come for his ex-wife's funeral. On Resnikoff's advice, Frank visits Jan Hartog, an ex-Somafree patient taking legal action against Dr. Raglan. Uncovering a row of tumors on his neck, Hartog says bitterly: ""Raglan encourages my body to revolt against me. And it did. I have a small revolution on my hands and I'm not putting it down very successfully.""Back at the institute, a drunk Barton Kelly arrives and is furious when Raglan will not allow him to see Nola. Meanwhile, Frank arrives at Candy's school where her teacher, Ruth Mayer, sits with her. Candy invites Ruth to dinner at her house. That evening, Ruth arrives and has dinner with Frank and Candy. A little later, Barton calls Frank from Juliana's house, saying he needs Frank's help to see Nola. Frank leaves Ruth babysitting Candy, who picks up a book to read which is titled 'The Shape Of Rage'. Raglan's book on Psychoplasmics.At Juliana's house, Barton is alone when the same small figure wearing the hooded red raincoat emerges from under his bed and batters him to a very gory death with a pair of paperweights. Frank arrives a few minutes later and finds the body. The strange-looking ""child"" jumps on him like some aggressive animal, clawing at him until it suddenly falls off his back to the floor and seemingly dies. Frank picks up the phone to call the police. Back at Frank's house, Ruth Mayer answers a phone call from Nola calling from the institute, who then goes in a berserk rage when Ruth answers the phone and suspects that she is having an affair with her husband.At the police station, Frank gives his statement and then meets the pathologist who performed the autopsy on the mysterious 'child creature' that attacked him where the doctor tells him that the creature died simply because: ""it ran out of gas"". Or more likely ""its batteries expired"". The pathologist points out that the creature has strange eyes, no sexual organs, and no navel. ""This creature has never really been born... at least not the way human beings are born"" says the pathologist.Raglan (as Ruth Mayer) speaks to Nola, Raglan/Ruth says that Frank will divorce Nola and marry her. The jealous Nola screams to leave Frank alone. When Frank gets home from the police station, Ruth leaves in a hurry. He finds Candy cowering in a corner of her bedroom after a nightmare. He tells her that the 'thing' is dead.The next morning, Raglan reads about Barton Kelly's murder. Taking a gun from his desk, he instructs his assistant, Chris, to get all the patients out of the institute. Meanwhile, Frank visits the hospital where Mike is now a fellow patient of Hartog's and is told that Nola is in fact the only patient at Somafree. Mike becomes angry about being dumped by his ""daddy"", his face becomes one giant red sore.Frank takes Candy to school. In Ruth Mayer's art class, two 'children creatures' in pastel coats with hoods pick up wooden hammers and beat Ruth mercilessly to a gory death. Alerted by a boy's cries for help, Frank enters the classroom to find Ruth dead, and Candy gone.At the institute, Raglan wakes Nola. She relates a dream that Candy was coming back to her, and says she doesn't feel threatened by Ruth Mayer any more. At the same time, Candy is being led along a snowy highway by the two creatures.That evening, Mike turns up on Frank's doorstep raving about: ""the disturbed kids in the work shed. The ones your wife's taking care of."" Frank drives to the Somafree Institute where outside Raglan pulls a gun on him, saying they'll kill him if he tries to take Candy away from them. In a long monologue, Raglan tells Frank that the child creatures that have been doing all the killing are Nola's children. ""Nola is not their surrogate mother, she's their real mother."" They are the Brood; the parthenogenesis 'children' of Nola's rage. Over the past year-and-a-half Nola's psychoplasmics have manifested into these children which carry out her bidding whenever she's in an angry mood. Raglan tells Frank that Candy is locked up in the attic where the Brood are being kept, and that if he wants Candy back, Frank must go to Nola to convince her that he wants Candy back to live with him. If he can do that, the Brood will be neutral so Raglan can go into the attic and take Candy, if not... the Brood will attack as long as Nola is in a rage.While Raglan waits outside the attic door where the Brood are being kept, Frank goes to Nola's room. He finds Nola rocking back and forth, wearing a white robe bathed in light. Nola wakes from her trance-like state and seems happy that he has come to see her. Frank says that he wants to be back with her. (Note: throughout the entire movie, Nola is only shown from the chest up which is apparently to hide something). At this point, Nola throws back her white robe, revealing an umbilical cord and external sac on her abdomen. The years of the welts that have appeared on her chest have merged together to create this womb outside her body as an incubator for the Brood that she produces. Frank recoils in horror and disgust.In the attic, Raglan quietly enters where all the sleeping Brood lie in their bunk beds. He finds Candy in one and picks her up to carry her out. Just then, the Brood stirs, sensing Nola's mounting anger.In Nola's room, she tears open the sac, removing a bloody 'infant' which she licks clean, as an animal might after having given birth. Frank's true feelings towards all this become apparent to Nola and her rage erupts.In the attic, the Brood finally become active, leaping on Raglan, who manages to shoot a few of them, but he gets overwhelmed and beaten to death by the Brood. In Nola's room, she angrily tells Frank that she would see Candy die then let him take her away. Upstairs, the Brood then turn their attention to the petrified Candy who runs and locks herself in the closet room in the attic, but they break through the door to grab at her. Frank attacks Nola and strangles her to death with his bare hands to save Candy when he hears the noises coming from the attic. When Nola stops breathing, all is suddenly silent.Frank goes upstairs to the attic to find all the Brood dead outside the room where Candy locked herself in, realizing that the Brood died without their mother's connection. Raglan is also dead nearby having been beaten to death and lying next to a few of the Brood he managed to kill before being overwhelmed. Candy is quivering in a corner of the room and Frank enters picks her up and tells her that he is taking her home. As Frank drives home with Candy, she seems to have withdrawn into a state of shock and cannot speak. Frank doesn't notice two raised lumps on her left arm... signs of her inner rage. The welts suggests that eventually like mother, like daughter..."

Despite Brian's claim about warnings from the superstitious locals about Matul, the four of them agree to set off together for the island.On Matul, tensions between  (Richard Johnson) and his contemptuous, highly strung-out wife Paola (Olga Karlatos) are running high. She wants to leave island, terrified about reports of zombie attacks. He insists on staying to conduct research into the phenomenon, despite the fact that his medical mission is falling apart. Leaving her alone to drink her fears away at their isolated beach house, Menard drives in his jeep to his hospital, which is a ramshackle converted church buzzing with flies.

The survivors are forced to shoot each corpse in the head to prevent them from reviving before burying them. On the drive back to the hospital, Menard tells his four visitors that Anne's father (Ugo Bologna) died three months earlier from the strange disease plaguing the island. Menard also tells the disbelieving visitors that the zombie epidemic, so far on the other side of the island, is blamed by the locals on the voodoo curses of a evil witch doctor. When they arrive at the hospital, Menard's nurse informs him that a friend has been taken ill. Menard then asks Peter, Anne, Brian, and Susan to drive over his house and check on the safety of his wife. Menard looks at his friend, Fritz, who claims he was bitten by a zombie in the village. Menard orders Lucas to lock all the doors and windows, now aware that the zombies are approaching this end of the island.Meanwhile, Peter, Anne, Brian, and Susan arrive without incident at the Menard cottage and upon entering they make a horrific discovery. The dead body of Mrs. Menard is sprawled out outside the bedroom door, half-eaten, surrounded by a small group of zombies who are gorging on her remains. Revolted, they fight their way past a group of slow-moving, staggering zombies and drive back to the hospital. But on the road, a zombie wonders into their path, and the jeep is damaged as they swerve into the dense tropical undergrowth. Peter's left ankle is broken upon the impact, but the group decide they must make it back to the hospital.A little later, the group stops for a rest in a small jungle clearing which they see is an old cemetery for the Spanish Conquistadors. As Peter and Anne lie down on the ground for a rest, the buried Conquistadors emerge from the soil. One of them grabs Anne by her hair while another grabs Peter by his broken ankle. The two of them break free, but Susan is not so lucky. Frozen in terror by the sight of a large, worm-faced cadaver (Ottaviano Dell'Acqua), she dies as it bites her throat out before it's dispatched by Peter and Brian, who bash the creature's head in. The three survivors are now obliged to make the journey back to the hospital as the living dead erupt from their tombs all over the island, as well as stalk the deserted shanty village nearby.At nightfall, Anne, Peter, and Brian finally arrive back at the hospital. Dr. Menard tends to Peter's broken ankle, while Brian helps Lucas and the nurse barricade the doors and windows. Menard is informed to his wife's fate, but does not comment on it. Instead, he raves about his failed efforts to find a scientific explanation for the walking dead and their instinct to feed on human flesh. Suddenly, a large group of the tottering, implacable creatures try to batter down the boarded up front door. Menard and the group begin to construct barricades as well as make Molotov cocktails from the kerosene tanks. However, the hospital's sick patients are dying and coming back as zombies, making the hospital under attack from inside and out. Menard is the first to go when he gets his face ripped off by the zombie Fritz, before it's killed by Brian with a gunshot to the head, the only way of killing the reanimated zombies. Lucas is next when he gets part of his arm bitten off by another zombie. The nurse is then killed by the zombie Lucas, who then attacks Anne but gets shot dead by Peter. The mob of zombies finally breaks down the front door, and a climactic battle between the three survivors and the foul creatures begins, with fire apparently the only effective weapon against the slow moving, walking stiffs. With the hospital now on fire from the exploding Molotov cocktails, Anne, Peter, and Brian are forced to flee from the burning building out the back door. But outside, Brian comes face to face with the walking corpse of the resurrected Susan. He succumbs to emotion and gets badly bitten on his arm as a result. The zombie Susan is immediately shot and killed by Peter, and the trio run for the beach with some zombies not far behind.As dawn breaks, the gerry-rigged boat limps back out to sea. Brian sinks into unconsciousness, terminally sick from the zombie bite, and soon dies. Peter and Anne lock the dead Brian up in the boat's cabin, for Peter wants the dead Brian as proof to the authorities that the whole experience happened. Turning on the radio, Peter and Anne listen in disbelief as a radio announcer explains about a zombie epidemic gripping New York City apparently brought on the by zombie from the opening scene. Down in the cabin, Brian's re-animated corpse frantically tries to get out of the hold it is locked up in.In New York City, a long line of freshly dead zombies are seen, slowly marching across the Brooklyn Bridge into Manhattan."

Time After Time,1979,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080025/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"H.G. Wells pursues Jack the Ripper to the 20th Century when the serial murderer uses the future writer's time machine to escape his time period. It's 1893 London. FuturistH.G. Wellsbelieves that the future holds a Utopian society. He also believes in time travel. He has just built a time machine which he is displaying to a group of skeptical friends, including surgeon Dr. John Leslie Stevenson. Unbeknown to Wells or anyone else among that circle, Stevenson is better known to the public as Jack the Ripper. Just as the police are about to capture Stevenson, he uses the time machine to escape, with Wells being the only one who knows what happened to him. Not telling anyone except his trusting housekeeper, Wells follows Stevenson in order to capture and bring him back to face justice. Where Stevenson has gone is 1979 San Francisco. There, Wells is dismayed to find that the future is not Utopia as he had predicted. But Wells is also picked up by a young woman named Amy Robbins. As Wells and Amy search for Stevenson, Stevenson conversely is after Wells to obtain the master key to the time machine. As Stevenson continues his murderous ways, he will stop at nothing to achieve his desires, which places Amy in danger.—Huggo H.G. Wells has just invented a time machine but hasn't tried it out yet. When he discovers that one of his friends is actually Jack the Ripper, Jack makes his escape using the time machine. Herbert follows Jack into the late 1970's where he meets Amy, a bank clerk, who teaches Herbert about life in 70's while they pursue Jack, who is enjoying the more violent society in which he continues his murderous activities.—Rob Hartill In 1893 London, England, popular writer Herbert George ""H.G."" Wells (Malcolm McDowell) displays a time machine to his skeptical dinner guests. After explaining how it works (including a ""non-return key"" that keeps the machine at the traveler's destination and a ""vaporizing equalizer"" that keeps the traveler and machine on equal terms), police constables arrive at the house searching for the serial killer Jack the Ripper. One finds a bag, with blood-stained gloves, belonging to one of Herbert's friends, a surgeon named John Leslie Stevenson (David Warner), whom they are unable to locate in the house, concluding that Stevenson might be the infamous killer. Wells races to his laboratory, but the time machine is gone.Stevenson has escaped to the future, but because he does not have the ""non-return"" key, it automatically returns to 1893. Herbert uses it to pursue Stevenson to November 5, 1979, where the machine has ended up on display at a museum in San Francisco realizing that due to the machine traveling backwards by the geographic longitide and latitude, the machine had ended up in the unfamiliar USA.As Herbert walks around the city, he is deeply shocked by the future, having expected it to be an enlightened socialist utopia, only to find chaos in the form of airplanes, automobiles and a worldwide history of war, crime and bloodshed.Searching numerous banks for Stevenson - he believes an Englishman might need to exchange old currency - Herbert meets liberated Chartered Bank of London employee Amy Robbins (Mary Steenburgen). She directs Herbert to the Hyatt Regency hotel, as she previously had Stevenson.Confronted in his room by his onetime friend Herbert, Stevenson confesses that he finds modern society to be pleasingly violent. Apologetically, he states: ""Ninety years ago, I was a freak. Now... I'm an amateur."" Herbert demands he return with him to 1893 to face justice, but Stevenson, who without the ""return key"" would be unable to prevent the machine from automatically returning (and thereby blocking Herbert from any further pursuit), attempts to wrest it from him. Their struggle is interrupted by a hotel employees and Stevenson flees, getting hit by a car during the frantic chase on foot. Herbert follows him to the San Francisco General Hospital emergency room and mistakenly gets the impression that Stevenson had died from his injuries.Herbert meets up with Amy Robbins again and she is the aggressor in a romance (succeeding, once Herbert is sure that she is in earnest). Stevenson returns to the bank to exchange more money. Rightly concluding that it was Amy who had led Herbert to him, he finds out where she lives. Herbert, hoping to convince her of the truth, takes a highly skeptical Amy three days into the future. Once there, she is aghast to see a newspaper headline revealing her own murder as the Ripper's fifth victim (a temporal paradox).Herbert persuades her that they must go back - it is their duty to attempt to prevent the fourth victim's murder, then prevent Amy's. However, they are delayed upon their return to the present and can do no more than phone the police. Stevenson kills again, and Herbert is arrested because of his knowledge of the killing. Amy is left alone, totally defenseless, and at the mercy of the ""San Francisco Ripper.""At the police station, Herbert unsuccessfully tries to convince the police of Amy's peril (his claim to be ""Sherlock Holmes"" has marked him as a lunatic well before mentioning a ""time machine""). At the same time, Amy attempts to hide from Stevenson. When the police finally do investigate her apartment, they find the dismembered body of a woman. Since he was in custody at the time Herbert is released having been cleared as a suspect.As Herbert wonders the dark streets mourning Amy's brutal death, he is suddenly confronted by Stevenson, who has actually killed Amy's co-worker Carol, who had accepted an invitation for dinner and to meet Wells. Stevenson then kidnapped Amy in order to extort the time machine key from Wells.Stevenson flees with the key - and Amy as insurance - to attempt a permanent escape in the time machine. Herbert gives chase in a car (despite not driving very well while Stevenson forces Amy to drive her car at gunpoint). Breaking into the museum, Herbert bargains for Amy's life, she is able to escape. As Stevenson starts up the time machine with the key, Herbert removes the ""vaporizing equalizer"" from the machine and Stevenson nods in understanding. The removal of this component, Herbert had confirmed earlier, causes the machine to remain in place while its passenger is sent traveling endlessly through time, with no way to stop; in effect sending him to oblivion.Herbert proclaims that the time has come to return to his own time, by himself, in order to destroy a machine that is too dangerous for primitive mankind. Amy pleads with him to take her along (despite her aversion to living in Victorian England). As they depart back to the past, she says that she is changing her name to Susan B. Anthony. The end credits reveal that the two later married."

Tourist Trap,1979,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080040/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A group of young friends stranded at a secluded roadside museum are stalked by a masked assailant who uses his telekinetic powers to control the attraction's mannequins. Teenagers come across a shut-in psychopath with telekinetic powers. He proceeds to use these powers to slay them one by one as well as animate the various mannequins he uses to keep himself company.—Dan Coker <pammyk@primenet.com> Four people go in search of their missing friend. What they find is Slausen's Lost Oasis, and mannequin dressed museum and a seemingly abadoned mansion owned by gentle old Mr. Slausen. He agrees to help with thei car trouble, but some of the girls decide to look for a working phone inside the house even though Mr. Slausen warned them not too. Hidden within the home is Mr. Slausen's misunderstood mask hidden younger brother. What they learn is that the mannaquins seem very much alive, or is there something much more terrifying behind the mask?—Wallace Entertainment Eileen (Robin Sherwood) and her boyfriend Woody (Keith McDermott) are driving through the desert. When their car gets a flat tire, Woody goes to find a gas station. Their friends Becky (Tanya Roberts), Jerry (Jon Van Ness) and Molly (Jocelyn Jones) are traveling separately in a different vehicle. They reach Eileen waiting at the car and they all drive off to collect Woody.Woody has found a gas station but it appears deserted. He enters the back room but becomes trapped when the door closes by itself behind him. Various mannequins appear in the room, and multiple objects fly at him until a metal pipe impales and kills him.A little later, Eileen, Becky, Molly and Jerry happen upon a run-down ghost town called 'Slausen's Lost Oasis' (the tourist trap in the title) and conclude Woody is there. As they drive in, their vehicle mysteriously breaks down. Jerry tries to fix his jeep and the girls go skinny dipping in a nearby oasis. As the three women swim, a strange-looking middle-aged man, who introduces himself as Mr. Slausen (Chuck Connors) appears holding a shotgun. Though outwardly polite, he also seems embittered by the decline of his tourist trap since the local expressway was moved away. The three nude girls feel awkward in the water as he casually chats with them, and they apologize for trespassing on his property.Slausen offers to help Jerry with the jeep, but insists the group go to his house with him to get his tools. There, they see the tourist trap: animated wax works type figures including armed bandits. Eileen is curious about a nearby house, but Slausen insists the women stay inside the museum. Slausen takes Jerry to fix the jeep leaving the women. Eileen leaves to find a phone in the other house. There she finds several mannequins inside the house. Someone calls her name, and a stranger wearing a grotesque mask suddenly appears behind her. Various items in the room move of their own accord and the scarf Eileen is wearing tightens and strangles her to death.Slausen returns to Molly and Becky saying that Jerry drove his truck into town. When told that Eileen left, he goes to the house and finds Eileen has been turned into a mannequin. He returns and tells Molly and Becky he did not find Eileen and will leave again to continue the search. Frustrated, the women also later leave to search for her. Becky enters the nearby house and finds a mannequin resembling Eileen. Becky is attacked by the masked killer and then by multiple mannequins. She later wakes up tied up in the basement along with Jerry. Jerry says the killer is Slausen's brother. Also held captive is a young woman named Tina (Dawn Jeffory), who is strapped to a table. She is killed when the masked man covers her face with plaster, causing her to suffocate. Jerry frees himself and attacks the killer, but is soon overpowered.

Jerry arrives to rescue Molly, but he is revealed to have unknowingly been turned into a mannequin as Slausen reveals it by ""removing"" his arm. Slausen dances with the mannequin figure of his wife, and Molly sees that the wife has become animated as a real person. Traumatized by all of this, Molly finds a hatchet where she sneaks up behind Slausen, and slams the axe into his shoulder as he turns around.

Rocky II,1979,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0079817/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Rocky struggles in family life after his bout with Apollo Creed, while the embarrassed champ insistently goads him to accept a challenge for a rematch. Rocky Balboa is enjoying life. He has a lovely wife, Adrian, had a successful fight with Apollo Creed and is able to enjoy the money he earned from the fight and a new endorsement deal. Unfortunately, Rocky becomes embarrassed when failing to complete an advert and ends up working in a meat packing company. He believes that he will no longer have a career as a boxer. Apollo wants to rematch with Rocky to prove all his critics wrong that he can beat Rocky. Can Rocky once again have a successful fight?—Film_Fan After Rocky Balboa and Apollo Creed fought each other in the ring, they were rushed to the hospital. After both were released, Rocky moved on and lives up to his newfound fortune and his Marriage to Adrian. After failed attempts at making commercials, and being laid off at a local meat company, Rocky decides to go back to being a boxer, but Adrian disapproves Rocky's decision as she is concerned for his well-being, and it effects his training, even though his trainer, Mickey Goodmill now wants him to fight right-handed. Meanwhile, Apollo became exceedingly angry at the rude and nasty comments on his fight with Rocky, eager for a rematch with him, Apollo even went public about it. then, Adrian fell into a coma after delivering her and Rocky's baby, after a few days, she awakens and was given the baby, which was named Rocky Jr. Then, Rocky continues his training, and then the fight begins, Apollo is still angry, but Rocky is more determined than ever to win.—John Wiggins Picking up immediately after the events in the first Rocky movie, Rocky II begins with the events of 14th round of the Bicentennial New Years Day fight from the first movie. The fight lasts the entire 15 rounds with each fighter suffering many devastating injuries. After the fight, Rocky calls out for Adrian, who runs down to the ring. As Creed is announced the winner by split decision, Adrian and Rocky embrace, and Rocky tells her that he loves her.After their championship bout, Rocky (Sylvester Stalone) and Apollo (Carl Weathers) are taken by ambulance to Pennsylvania Hospital in Center City (a WCAU-TV Channel 10 news truck follows behind the ambulance), where they meet once again in the hospital lobby with a mob of reporters. Apollo Creed, who retained the championship on points, is furious at Rocky, the first man to go the distance with him, and starts clamoring for another chance to knock Rocky out. Rocky is taken into surgery where the doctor will fix his broken nose. He tells Rocky he may need eye surgery to repair a detached retina.Rocky goes to Apollo's room that night and asks ""Did you give me your best?"" to which Apollo answers ""Yeah."" Rocky declines talk of a rematch and tells Apollo that he is quitting boxing.Following his hospital stay, Rocky proposes to Adrian (Talie Shire) in front of the tiger paddock at the Philadelphia Zoo, and they later get married in a private church ceremony. Rocky begins to enjoy the profits from his fight with Apollo. He buys his first brand new car, a 1979 Pontiac Trans Am (even though it's still supposedly 1976), goes on a shopping spree (purchasing a black leather jacket with a tiger on the back for himself, a fur coat for Adrian, and some gold wristwatches), and buys a two-story row house in a nicer Philly neighborhood. He also convinces his previous employer, the loan shark Gazzo (Joe Spinell), to give Paulie (Burt Young) his old collecting job. Rocky then opts to earn money by appearing in television commercials. His new career, however, is quickly derailed by his sub-par reading skills, which leads to a clash with the director of his first commercial -- Rocky is unable to read the cue cards while wearing ridiculous costumes to promote a men's cologne. He is rudely dismissed by the director.Over the next few months, Rocky, unable to find white-collar work due to his lack of education beyond the 9th grade, and after being laid off (because of cutbacks) from the meat packing plant where Paulie previously worked, gets a job ""helping out"" as an assistant trainer at Mickey's gym, where the other fighters in training seem to have lost a large amount of respect for him, likely because he lost to Apollo and because he's taken on the job of sweeping the floor and rings and empty the spit buckets. Adrian, now pregnant, returns to her old job at the pet store. Running short on money from his unwise spending spree, Rocky also hands over his new Trans Am car to Paulie, who agrees to take over the insurance payments.Meanwhile, Apollo Creed has been receiving hate mail about his split-decision win over Rocky and is filled with anger and frustration: the letters alternately accuse him of deliberately carrying ""that chump"" (Rocky) the distance or state outright that he should have lost and has no business calling himself the champ. Determined to prove himself and win back the respect of his fans, Apollo elects to try and pressure Rocky into another fight, despite protests from his trainer, Tony ""Duke"" Evers, to find a new contender to fight against (when asked by Apollo what Tony is afraid of, Tony replies ""He's all wrong for us. I saw you beat that man like I ain't never seen no man get beat before. And the man kept coming after you.""). Rocky himself begins to have second thoughts about the fight, but because of the pressure applied by Apollo, Rocky decides to accept the challenge for a rematch against Apollo on Thanksgiving 1976 and begins training once again.Mickey is angrily unwilling to train Rocky at first, due to his bad eye, which will hinder his reflexes in defending any hits to his right side. However, after seeing Apollo making fun of Rocky on public television, he becomes furious and agrees to train Rocky. Mickey decides he wants the left-handed Rocky to learn to fight right-handed in order to better protect the eye, and to give him a surprise advantage by switching back to left-handed with the intention of throwing off Apollo's timing and confusing him. He also focuses on improving Rocky's speed by using an old training method from his own boxing days: he forces Rocky to chase a chicken around a vacant lot, stating, ""If you can catch this thing you can catch greased lightning."" Rocky tells Mickey he feels like an idiot.However, Adrian's opposition saps Rocky's resolve and his training suffers. When Paulie confronts Adrian about her opinion, her angry reaction creates a serious medical condition that breaks her water prematurely. During the birth of their son, Adrian falls into a coma, and as a result of the premature birth, their son is placed into an incubator at the hospital ICU. Rocky breaks away from training to spend every waking moment either at her side or in the hospital chapel with Mickey, not even seeing his newborn son until several days later when she recovers. When Adrian emerges from the coma and Rocky sees their newborn son for the first time, she tells Rocky to ""win"" and he restarts training in earnest with Mickey for the rematch with Apollo. His condition improves dramatically with increased strength and speed and Mickey's plan of training Rock as a right-handed fighter. He runs pulling Mickey on a bicycle behind him and finally catches the chicken Mick had him chase, much to his trainer's delight.As with the first fight, Rocky's training includes his famous brisk run throughout the city of Philadelphia. This time, however, he is greeted with the cheers and encouragement of onlookers as he runs through the streets of South Philadelphia, having become a local celebrity despite his narrow loss to Apollo. Along the way, children and pre-teens begin to follow him, their numbers increasing dramatically block by block. By the time he reaches the Benjamin Franklin Parkway in Center City, hundreds of young people have joined in. Ultimately, they follow Rocky to the top of the steps of the Philadelphia Museum of Art, surrounding him and enthusiastically chanting his name as he lifts his arms in a victory pose.Rocky and Apollo once again fight an intense battle in front of a standing-room-only crowd at the Philadelphia Spectrum. Paulie and a still-recovering Adrian stay home to watch the match on their TV set. Gazzo personally attends the match with a front-row seat as he did during the first match. Unlike the first match, Apollo gets off to a fast start, flooring Rocky twice in the first two rounds and building a huge lead on the scorecards as the fight goes on. But throughout the fight, Rocky pounds away at Apollo on and off, turning the fight into a brutal battle.At the start of the 15th and final round, Apollo's trainer begs him not to try to go for a knockout, as he can win simply by avoiding Rocky. Apollo, desperately wanting to prove he can knock out Rocky and very frustrated that he keeps coming back, disregards the advice. Mickey suddenly tells Rocky to switch back to boxing left-handed, and although Rocky initially refuses, he switches back, landing several crushing lefts. Rocky hits Apollo with a final punch that knocks him down, but from sheer exhaustion, Rocky also goes down to the canvas. The referee starts the final ten-count as the fighters struggle to their feet.At the count of 9, Apollo, finally realizing all but too late that the last fight was not fixed, collapses to the canvas while reaching for the top rope, thus ending his 47-win streak, while Rocky picks himself up by the 10th and final count and is declared the new World Heavyweight Champion. In his post-match speech, he thanks Apollo for another hard-fought battle, Mickey for training him, and God. Rocky states ""Except for my kid being born, this is the greatest night in the history of my life, and I just want to say one thing to my wife who's home: Yo, Adrian! I did it!"""
The Black Hole,1979,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078869/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A research vessel finds a missing ship, commanded by a mysterious scientist, on the edge of a black hole. An Earth exploratory ship, the USS Palomino, discovers a black hole with a lost ship, the USS Cygnus, just outside its event horizon. Deciding to solve the mystery of the Cygnus are: the Palomino's Captain, Dan Holland; his First Officer, Lieutenant Charlie Pizer; journalist Harry Booth; scientist and ESP-sensitive Dr. Kate McCrae, whose father was the Cygnus's First Officer; Dr. Alex Durant, the expedition's civilian leader; and the robot known as V.I.N.CENT. The Palomino attempts a dangerous fly-by of the darkened ship. As they come within close range of it, the buffeting they experience (due to the black hole's gravity) suddenly ceases. They bring more instruments to bear on the derelict, but do not even realize the gravity-free zone is artificial; slipping outside it, they are almost drawn into the black hole, an abyss from which no one can escape. Matters worsen when Reinhardt holds the crew captive, after realizing that they can help him reach his goal. The squad must now figure out a way to flee from Reinhardt -- before it's too late.—Anthony Pereyra {hypersonic91@yahoo.com} A spaceship, the USS Palomino, encounters a massive black hole. To the amazement of the crew, stationed on the edge of the black is the USS Cygnus, a ship thought lost 20 years earlier. The Cygnus was commanded by Dr Hans Reinhardt, a scientific genius. The crew warily board the Cygnus.—grantss The crew of the spaceship Palamino stumbles across the ''lost'' ship U.S.S. Cygnus, hovering on the edge of an immense black hole. Once aboard, they find the ship is manned by robots - it's only human inhabitant, one Dr. Hans Reinhardt; an eminent scientist, missing for the past twenty years. His plan - to enter the Black Hole . . . Whether Dr. Reinhardt is a genius or a mad-man, one thing is for sure, he will not be denied his life's dream. What lies beyond the Black Hole? Immortality . . . or, Oblivion . . . ?—Mark Harding <mah@imdb.com> For five years the crew of the PALOMINO has ranged through deep space, searching for evidence of alien life--with no result. Then, their mission almost at an end, they discover a giant collapsar--the largest black hole ever encountered--and, drifting perilously near it, is the long-lost legendary starship CYGNUS...Incredibly, the ship is not a lifeless hulk. Its commander--the genius who designed the CYGNUS and planned its epic voyage--still survives, served by a horde of mechanical slaves. But Commander Hans Reinhardt has no desire to be rescued. He has a rendezvous with the incredibly hellish forces of the collapsar--and he plans to take the PALOMINO'S crew along on his doomed adventure.—Alan Dean Foster In the year 2130, the deep space research ship USS Palomino is on a search for intelligent non-human life on other planets. The crew is comprised of Captain Dan Holland (Robert Forster), Lt. Charles Pizer - the hotshot first officer (Joseph Bottoms); utility droid LF#396, informally known as VINCENT (voice ofRoddy McDowall); Dr. Alex Durant (Anthony Perkins) - navigator and science officer; Dr. Kate McCrae (Yvette Mimieux) - medical officer and empath, who maintains a telepathic rapport with VINCENT via her ESP; and embedded journalist Harry Booth (Ernest Borgnine). After five years of fruitless searching, the Palomino is now on her way home for a refit when VINCENT notices a large, swirling blue accretion disk and recommends a course correction. VINCENT identifies the disk as a black hole, the largest discovered in recent history.While the crew nervously discuss the destructive potential of black holes, VINCENT reveals something else: an apparently derelict ship standing off from the black hole's event horizon (line of no return) and somehow able to remain stationary when it almost certainly should have been sucked in. Pizer and Booth are more shocked to see a ship so far from home (when the Palomino should have been the first spaceship to reach this deep in space) than they are to see the black hole. VINCENT identifies the ship as USS Cygnus, with the German scientist Hans Reinhardt (Maximilian Schell) commanding, which disappeared nearly 20 years earlier after failing to heed recall orders after its mission, the same as Palomino's, was declared a failure. (In addition, Booth remembers Reinhardt as arrogant, pompous, and utterly heedless of the value of taxpayers' money.) The Cygnus, however, holds another significance for the crew of Palomino: its XO, Frank McCrae, is Kate's father.Against his better judgment, Holland accepts the recommendations of Pizer and Durant and comes about to rendezvous with Cygnus. As they approach, they come under the influence of the black hole's tremendous gravity. But at their closest approach, the gravity ceases. Durant speculates that something from the Cygnus is responsible, but no one aboard can decide what that might be. The Palomino suddenly falls away from Cygnus and is very nearly sucked into the black hole. Palomino escapes but is badly damaged and now needs spare parts. So when Palomino once again comes under the protective influence of Cygnus, the crew start to look for a way to board--when suddenly Cygnus blazes with light, as if to welcome them.Palomino docks with Cygnus, and the crew, except for Lt. Pizer, disembark. They enter a vestibule, where automatic laser fire destroys their guns and knocks out VINCENT -- he is not seriously damaged, but his combat protocols are now offline. Holland radios Pizer, telling them they have been disarmed, but uninjured, before the crew moves forward. Then they board an automatic cart, part of a ship-wide transportation system, and ride in comfort to Cygnus' conning tower. They ride a hoist to the tower cab, which they find occupied by a crew of ""humanoids"" with hooded robes and mirrored faceplates. Though the humanoids ignore them, they do get the attention of an oxblood-colored levitating war machine who wordlessly challenges VINCENT to a face-off. Before the two robots can go into combat, Dr. Reinhardt emerges from the shadows and orders them to stand down. He identifies the war machine as Maximilian, his cybernetic master-at-arms.Reinhardt says that he is the only human aboard. Cygnus was disabled by a meteor storm, he and Frank McCrae stayed behind to make repairs while the rest of the crew left Cygnus in an attempt to reach Earth, never to be seen again. The elder McCrae has since passed on. He also admits, or rather avows, that he refused to obey his recall orders because he proposes to reconnoiter the black hole--and pilot his ship ""in, through, and beyond"" it, to another dimension that he is sure exists.Their conversation is interrupted when a squad of armored ""sentry robots"" brings in Pizer under arrest. Reinhardt smooths the situation over and then offers to provide spare parts for the Palomino. Pizer and VINCENT take charge of requisitioning the parts they need, and they meet LF#28, informally known as BOB, (voice ofSlim Pickens), an old rusted sanitation droid who has languished since the human crew's disappearance.A little later, Holland happens upon several of the humanoids conducting what looks like a funeral for one of their own. He also finds crew quarters still containing furnishings and uniforms, a finding totally inconsistent with a wholesale abandonment of the ship. Elsewhere, Booth discovers the ship's on-board garden--which is as big as a jungle and easily ""big enough to feed an army,"" and notes that its mute groundskeeper is sporting a notable limp. The crew of Palomino reassemble to discuss what they have seen--and while Holland very much wants to accept the spare parts and depart from Cygnus as rapidly as possible, Durant and McCrae are curious about Reinhardt's black-hole reconnaissance plans. Reinhardt launches an experimental probe-ship to reconnoiter the black hole's event horizon, then invites the Palomino crew to a dinner party, where he will explain his research.While Reinhardt entertains the Palomino crew in his spacious, Victorian-inspired dining hall, VINCENT hangs out in a shooting gallery with BOB and several sentry robots, led by their prototype, Captain STAR. BOB explains that STAR had been the master-at-arms until Reinhardt built Maximilian, and is also responsible for much of the abuse BOB has endured over the years. STAR challenges BOB to a shooting match, and wins only because he had distracted BOB by bumping him as he was shooting. BOB then confesses that he let STAR win on purpose, to avoid retaliation. Outraged, VINCENT challenges STAR to a match. Though STAR again cheats, VINCENT still manages to beat him, and STAR is so angered by his defeat that he ends up literally blowing a fuse. BOB, impressed, asks VINCENT to meet him in the parts-storage bay.Inside the dining hall, Reinhardt is eagerly discussing his research with his new guests. Eventually, Maximilian notifies him that the probe-ship has returned, and Reinhardt excuses himself to debrief the pilot. After he has left, Holland and Booth discuss the inconsistencies they have discovered in Reinhardt's story. Holland and Booth are now convinced that Reinhardt is insane, but Durant wants to give him the benefit of the doubt.Now able to speak freely, BOB restores VINCENT's combat protocols to 100%, and tells him the real story: the humanoids are not robots at all, but are in fact the crew of Cygnus, reduced to drone-like mentality by a series of laser prefrontal lobotomies. As the two robots are reconnoitering the sick bay where some maintenance lobotomies are taking place, two sentry robots discover them. VINCENT and BOB destroy them and hide the evidence. They then rejoin Holland, Pizer, and Booth, who have returned to Palomino while Durant and McCrae have remained in the conning tower cab with Reinhardt. BOB tells the three men what really happened to the crew: that when the recall order was refused, Frank McCrae attempted to relieve Reinhardt of his command. Reinhardt accused Mr. McCrae of mutiny and then killed him. He then had his sentry robots capture the rest of the crew and subject them to the prefrontal lobotomies that have turned them into ""humanoid robots."" Meanwhile, Reinhardt and Maximilian discover the remains of the two sentry robots BOB and VINCENT were forced to destroy, and decide that it is now time to ""liquidate"" their guests.Holland orders VINCENT to use his ESP to contact McCrae and order her to return to Palomino with or without Durant, and to ""tell her why."" With that result, McCrae tells Durant that Reinhardt is a murderer, and that the apparent robots who are running the tower-cab systems are really the original crew. Durant removes the faceplate from a crewman, revealing his human face beneath. McCrae is nauseated at the sight-- Maximilian suddenly breaks off from his post and summarily executes Durant. Reinhardt scolds Maximilian, who nevertheless returns to his post. Reinhardt then appeals to McCrae to somehow ""protect him from Maximilian""--whereupon McCrae denounces him to his face and says, ""If there is any justice at all, the black hole will be your grave!""As a rejoinder, Reinhardt orders McCrae taken by force to sick bay to be lobotomized. Aboard the Palomino, VINCENT tells Holland that Durant is dead and McCrae is being taken to sick bay. Holland, VINCENT, and BOB then rush to the Cygnus' sick bay, rescue McCrae, and destroy half a platoon of sentry robots in a pitched battle, to the horror of Reinhardt, who watches on a video monitor. Reinhardt orders the sentry robots to terminate any unauthorized humanoids on that section of the ship, then instructs Maximilian to let Palomino take off and then destroy it at a distance with the Cygnus laser cannons, while he continues to prepare to dive into the black hole.When the allotted time passes, Booth is eager to write off Holland and McCrae as dead and leave. Pizer refuses, insisting on a rescue attempt. Succumbing to cowardice, Booth feigns an injury so that Pizer will let him return to the ship. Holland, McCrae, and the droids find themselves pinned down by sentry robots as they get closer to the Palomino, but Pizer, armed with twin pistols, manages to outflank the attackers. Booth then tries to take off in the Palomino alone. Endangering the Cygnus and himself due to his poor piloting skills, he nearly hits the conning tower before Cygnus' laser cannons shoot him down-- Palomino then crashes into Cygnus in a near-miss that causes some minor, but critical, damage. The Palomino crew now have only one avenue of escape: the probe-ship.As the Cygnus gets closer to the accretion disk, it is pulverized by a hailstorm of meteors, severely compromising its hull and taking its emergency reactors and null gravity generators offline. The Palomino survivors must dodge a large, red-hot meteor that crashes into the ship and traverses the entire main corridor, and pass through the ship's garden after it, too, is breached, all the while dodging and battling sentry robots.In the conning tower cab, the humanoid crew receive alarming signs that the ship is now subject to structural overload. Reinhardt orders Maximilian to prepare the probe-ship for launch. As Maximilian starts to leave, a seven-foot video monitor tears loose from its fastenings and crashes to the deck, pinning Reinhardt beneath it. In a hint of the poetic justice that he will eventually receive, Reinhardt cries out for help, first to Maximilian, who apparently deserts him to make his/its own escape in the probe-ship, and then to his lobotomized crew, who of course cannot understand him.Maximilian reaches the probe-ship docking hoist first and ambushes the surviving Palmonino crew. After BOB is taken offline and Pizer is knocked out, VINCENT attacks Maximilian, giving Holland, Pizer, and McCrae time to board the probe-ship. VINCENT and Maximilian fight using every gadget at their disposal, culminating with Maximilian catching VINCENT in a bear hug-like grab and attempting to electocute him. VINCENT responds by using his cutting armatures to disable Maximilian's antigravity stabilizers, which sends him spinning out of control through a hull breach and into the black hole.BOB, too weak to function any longer, says his goodbyes to VINCENT, who then reluctantly abandons BOB and boards the probe-ship. Holland lifts off as the Cygnus, now twisted into a lump beyond all recognition, is caught up in the whirlwind of stellar detritus that surrounds the black hole. Holland tries to set a course away from the black hole, but nothing responds. VINCENT soon realizes that the ship has been programmed to follow the course that Reinhardt had set for it: a straight dive down the vortex funnel of the black hole. Unable to alter that course, the three humans decide to ""pray that Reinhardt was a genius.""The probe-ship takes its straight dive down the black-red vortex and into the black hole. As it does, the crew start to hear voices--Reinhardt's and their own--repeating words spoken long ago, an effect of the tremendous time dilation as space-time is bent.Suddenly the viewpoint shifts to Reinhardt, floating out of control in the reddish vortex of the black hole in the same pose that he assumed when the seven-foot monitor in the tower cab crushed him. Then he catches up with Maximilian--or rather, Maximilian, who has been waiting for him, now takes him in an unbreakable embrace and draws him closer--until Reinhardt becomes Maximilian, which the viewer realizes because Maximilian's charged-coupler optical device is now a simple visor, out of which Reinhardt's frightened eyes suddenly stare. Worse yet, Reinhardt/Maximilian finds himself standing on a basalt promontory over a fire-covered craggy landscape, accompanied by his lobotomized crew. As the view withdraws from Reinhardt/Maximilian and pans down and then forward to show Cygnus' crew and then the fiery lake behind them, the viewer realizes that they are all, quite simply, in hell.Then a church-window-shaped portal opens, and the viewpoint rushes through it and through an arched corridor, through which a robed figure, arms outstretched, floats past the viewer and forward. Next, the viewpoint picks up on the probe-ship, now heading toward the viewer and out of a nebula-like star. Aboard, Holland, Pizer, McCrae, and VINCENT awaken from an apparent trance and realize that they are headed toward a bright light in space--not the harsh, lethal light of a star, but a very pleasant, warm light. They sit back and let the probe ship take them toward the light--which is apparently a white hole: the portal of heaven. The so-called four survivors of the USS Palomino have put the black hole behind them forever."

When a judge is charged with rape, Arthur Kirkland is forced to defend him. Kirkland has had problems with the judge in the past, including one incident when the judge wrongly sentenced his client Jeff McCullaugh because of a technicality. Kirkland faces a moral and legal dilemma.—Melissa Portell <mportell@s-cwis.unomaha.edu> Arthur Kirkland, an idealistic defense attorney in Baltimore, cares about his clients and visits his aging grandfather, who put him through law school, every week. Things aren't going well for Arthur: two of his clients are increasingly desperate, neither should be in prison, his partner is behaving bizarrely, he's begun an affair with an attorney who's on the bar's disciplinary committee, his favorite judge may have a death wish, and then, the judge he dislikes most, a by-the-book martinet, demands that Arthur defend him when he's accused of a brutal assault on a young woman. Is there any way to expose real corruption and find justice for all?—<jhailey@hotmail.com> A lawyer, Arthur Kirkland, challenges the US legal system as he defends innocent people who are convicted of crimes they did not commit, and a guilty judge he is forced to defend who tries to use his status in court to aquitt himself. Kirkland is disgusted with the corrupt courts and tries to bring justice to people who are innocent and punishment to people who are guilty. Arthur Kirkland is a principled and dedicated Baltimore-based defense attorney. He stands up for what he believes in, and as such has spent time in jail for contempt for what he believed was the unfair treatment by the judge, Henry Fleming, for his innocent client, Jeff McCullaugh. It is thus well known that Arthur hates Fleming. It is because of that public knowledge that Fleming requests Arthur to be his defense attorney when he is charged with the violent rape of Leah Shepard. Due to circumstances, Arthur has no other option but to take Judge Fleming's case. As the case progresses, the judicial system around Arthur seems to be crumbling. His law partner, Jay Porter, is slowly falling apart due to the guilt associated with the actions of guilty clients for whom he got acquittals. Judge Fleming still seems to be stalling on Arthur's request to review McCullaugh's case, McCullaugh who is still in prison, where he has been beaten and raped. In dealing with other issues, Arthur asks another colleague, Warren Fresnell, to handle the probation hearing for another of his clients, scared transvestite Ralph Agee; however, unknown to Arthur, Warren is more concerned with his billable time than he is in doing his colleague a favor. With all this happening around Arthur and evidence emerging that Fleming is indeed innocent of the charges against him, he is more determined than ever to see that justice is done, even for Fleming who he still hates. This goal is affected by the determination of the prosecutor, Frank Bowers, whose sole mission seems to be to see Fleming in jail as a figurative trophy on his mantelpiece, and the seeming self death wish of the presiding judge, Francis Rayford. Arthur uses as his ethical and legal touchstones his new girlfriend, Gail Patrick, a member of the legal ethics committee, and his paternal grandfather Sam, who raised him, is the reason that he became a lawyer, is his only surviving family member and who is slowly deteriorating from dementia.—Huggo"

After a collision with a comet, a nearly five mile (eight kilometer) wide piece of the asteroid ""Orpheus"" is heading toward Earth. If it hits, it will cause an incredible catastrophe which will probably extinguish mankind. To stop the meteor, N.A.S.A. wants to use the illegal nuclear weapon satellite ""Hercules"", but soon discovers that it doesn't have enough firepower. Their only chance to save the world is to join forces with the U.S.S.R., which has also launched such an illegal satellite. But will both governments agree? A collision between a comet and an asteroid named Orpheus takes place. Now the meteor Orpheus, which is five miles wide, is on a collision course with Earth. While the United States government and military engage in political maneuvering, other smaller and faster moving fragments rain down on Earth. The major plot point involves secret orbiting nuclear missile platforms, one put up by Dr. Bradley's (Connery) team for the U.S., named Hercules and another constructed by his counterpart in the Soviet Union, nicknamed Peter the Great by Dubov. The American president (Fonda) is advised by military leaders against admitting the existence of Hercules, at the same time the Soviets are reluctant to admit to the existence of its orbital weapons.The President goes on national television and reveals the existence of Hercules, explaining it as a foresighted project to meet the threat that Orpheus represents. He also offers the Soviets a chance to save face and join in by saying they had the same foresight and have their own. Bradley requested a scientist named Dr. Alexei Dubov (Keith) to help him plan a countereffort against Orpheus.Bradley and Sherwood have already arrived at the control center for Hercules, which is located beneath the Sony Building (then called the AT&T Building) in downtown New York. Major-General Adlon (Landau) is the commander of the facility. Dubov and his assistant (and English voice) Tatiana Donskaya (Natalie Wood) arrive and Bradley works at breaking the ice of distrust held by Hercules commander Adlon. Since Dubov cannot admit the existence of the Soviet device, he agrees to Bradley's proposal that they work on the ""theoretical"" application of how a ""theoretical"" Soviet platform's weapons would be coordinated with the American ones.Meanwhile, further fragments of the meteor affect the Earth. The Soviets finally admit that they have the device and are willing to join in the effort.

On Sunday morning, Peter the Great's missiles are fired off because of its position along the orbit, Hercules is fired 40 minutes later.Hercules is launched, and a moment later, New York is wiped out by a fragment of the meteor (one scene shows the World Trade Center destroyed in a giant fireball). Several workers inside the control center are killed when the facility is partially destroyed. The survivors slowly work their way out of what has become a trap, dealing with the East River breaking into the tunnels. Meanwhile, the two sets of missiles are linking up into three waves of mixed nationality. The Hercules crew reach a subway station filled with other people and wait while others try to dig out. The radio stations broadcast news of the result: Orpheus has been either obliterated or shifted to a harmless trajectory. Just then, the subway station occupants are rescued.Later, the scene switches to an airport with a Soviet flag and an American flag on a hanger door. from here, Dubov and Tatiana say goodbye to Bradley and others, then they board a plane with the Soviet star and it takes off for Russia.["

""Cactus"" Jack Slade (Kirk Douglas) is the meanest bad man in the west, or so he thinks. When a bank robbery goes awry, he lands in jail facing a hangman's noose. When the corrupt owner of the bank offers him a job, Jack sees a chance to stay alive and get rich in the process. All he has to do is steal a strongbox full of money the banker lent to Mr. Parody Jones (Strother Martin) who needs it to keep his mining operation going. If he defaults on the loan, our ""friendly"" banker takes over the mine. Ms. Charming Jones (Ann-Margret) comes to town to collect the money and take it back to her father, Parody. To ensure the money makes it back home, Parody has called in a favor from a man who owes him a life debt. Enter Handsome Stranger (Arnold Schwarzenegger). The toughest and strongest hero in the west. As tough as a steel plate but, unfortunately, just as dense. As Charming and Handsome set off on their journey, Jack sets out after them. Using his trusty ""Bad Men Of The West"" handbook, Jack sets one trap after another only to have each one go awry in true Wile E. Coyote versus The Roadrunner fashion.

Very funny.Full Synopsis:The fun begins as outlaw Cactus Jack Slade attempts to rob the bank using a ""bank robber's guide"". The attempted bank robbery is an hilarious scene in itself, as Cactus Jack encounters the drunken bank teller after hours, and ends up blowing up the bank while trying to open the safe.When Parody Jones sends his daughter, Charming (who obviously LOVES good-looking men), to bring her inheritance back from the bank, banker Avery Simpson decides that he wants the cash and, despite the fact that Cactus Jack destroyed his bank, hires the bumbling outlaw to bring the money back. Not trusting anyone, Parody Jones recruits Handsome Stranger (who owes him a favor) to escort his daughter back with the money. The naïve Handsome Stranger fulfills his obligation by meeting Charming as she gets off of the train, to remain with her until they return to her homestead.The always hilarious Mel Tillis provides more fun as the telegraph operator helping Handsome Stranger with the message from Parody Jones.Once Charming Jones and Handsome Stranger start toward the Jones' homestead with the money, more fun ensues as Cactus Jack (who you would swear was just like the coyote in the Road Runner cartoons) attempts to stop them to get the cash. Along the way, they also encounter Chief Nervous Elk. Cactus Jack's horse, Whiskey, is every bit as much a character as Cactus Jack himself. You'll never see a horse with more personality in any film!For those who truly enjoy western spoofs with a touch of Looney Tunes, you'll definitely enjoy this delightful film! Be sure to watch for a slight plot twist at the end!!!"
Quadrophenia,1979,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0079766/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Jimmy Cooper loathes his job and his parents. He seeks solace with his mod clique, scooter riding, and drugs, only to be disappointed. Director Franc Roddam has assembled an array of young British acting talents who bring back London's 1960s Mods and Rockers. Set against the soundtrack of The Who's high-concept album ""Quadrophenia"", Phil Daniels plays working-class Jimmy Cooper, a drug-using Mod who hates his job and is taken the wrong way by his parents. But by night, he comes alive with the all-nighters, his amphetamine pills, and his scooter-riding friends; he's always on a high, and life cannot get any better. Then comes the Brighton Scooter Run, where the Mods and the Rockers converge, ending in the Battle of the Cults on Brighton Beach. What goes up must come down, and with Jimmy's come-down, his life is turned around, and so begins his downward spiral into paranoia, isolation, and the four-faceted mindset: Quadrophenia. With its extremely realistic language, violent overtones, and classic 1960s soundtrack, this illness is bound to be contagious. Come along for the ride.—Cinema_Fan Jimmy Cooper, loathing his dead-end job and dead-end parents, is primed to go off the edge. The Lambretta scooter, bespoke suit and the other trappings of being Mod make for a subversive rebellion against his working-class surroundings. But even the amphetamine pills and fleeting moments with his mates don't ease the assault of growing pains that are deepening his alienation. This only gets messier when he finally joins one of the headline seaside clashes of 1964 between the Mods and their mortal enemies, the motorcycle-cruising, leather-clad Rockers. However, a reality check of his idol, the smooth Ace Face hastens Jimmy's identity crisis. This human drama, adapted from and featuring The Who's seminal album ""Quadrophenia"", bursts with all the tragic frustration and irrepressible euphoria of youth on the verge of adulthood.—Rhino Home Video The film takes place in 1964 and follows the life of Jimmy Cooper (Phil Daniels), a young London Mod. Disillusioned by his parents and a dull job as a post room boy in an advertising firm, Jimmy finds an outlet for his teenage angst by taking amphetamines, partying, riding scooters and brawling with Rockers, accompanied by his Mod friends Dave (Mark Wingett), Chalky (Philip Davis) and Spider (Gary Shail). One of the Mods' rivals, the Rockers, is in real life Jimmy's childhood friend, Kevin Herriot (Ray Winstone). An attack by hostile Rockers on Spider leads to a retaliation attack on Kevin. Jimmy initially participates in the beating, but upon realising the victim is Kevin, he berates the other attackers but does not stop them, instead riding away on his scooter.A bank holiday weekend provides the excuse for the rivalry between Mods and Rockers to come to a head, as they both descend upon the seaside town of Brighton. Jimmy plans to be noticed as a 'face', and hints to Steph (Leslie Ash) -- a girl on whom he has a crush -- that he would like her to ride with him, but she confirms plans to ride instead with Pete (Garry Cooper), an older, well-heeled Mod. To prepare for the weekend, the friends attempt to buy some recreational drugs from London gangster Harry North (John Bindon), but are cheated with fake pills. After vandalizing the drug-dealer's car from retaliation, they desperately rob a pharmacy, finding a large quantity of their favorite ""blues"".After an early morning group ride from London to the south coast, the friends gather on the seafront, where Jimmy first sees a flamboyant scooter-riding Mod known as Ace Face (Sting). Later in a dance hall, Jimmy suggests that he will help Steph, whose escort is now chatting to an attractive American girl, to dance with Ace Face, whereupon Jimmy plots to gain attention by climbing up on the balcony-edge and dancing with much applause, annoying Ace Face. After diving into the audience, Jimmy is ejected by bouncers. Steph's escort leaves with the American girl, and once again Jimmy attempts to get with Steph, this time for the night, but she has arranged accommodation with a female friend.The friends spend the night sleeping rough, meet up at a cafe on the following morning, then proceed along the promenade, where a series of running battle ensue. As the police corner the rioters, Jimmy escapes down an alleyway with Steph, and they have sex. When the pair emerge, they find themselves in the middle of the melee just as police are detaining rioters. Jimmy is arrested and detained with a volatile Ace Face, and later fined the then-large sum of £50. When fined with a hefty £75, Ace Face mocks the magistrate by offering to pay on the spot with a cheque, impressing the fellow Mods.Back in London, Jimmy becomes severely depressed. His mother throws him out after she finds his stash of amphetamine pills. He then quits his job, spends his severance package on more pills, and finds out that Steph has become Dave's girlfriend. After briefly fighting with Dave, the following morning his rejection is confirmed by Steph, and his beloved Lambretta scooter is accidentally damaged in a crash involving a Royal Mail parcel van. Jimmy takes a train back to Brighton, taking increasing levels of pills and becoming emotionally unstable.In an attempt to relive the recent excitement, he revisits the scenes of the riots and his encounter with Steph. To his horror, Jimmy discovers that his idol, Ace Face, in real life has a menial job as a bellboy at the Grand Brighton Hotel. Jimmy steals Ace's Vespa scooter and heads out to Beachy Head, where he rides perilously close to the cliff edge. Finally, he crashes the scooter over a cliff, which is where the film begins, with Jimmy walking back from the cliff top in the sunset backdrop."

The standard response to inmate-on-inmate violence when asked by the guards is ""I fell sir"" - the fear of retaliation is more compelling than any help you might or might not get from the staff. There's a really brutal and realistic rape scene in the garden shed of a younger looking inmate, while a guard looks in through the window, appearing to be enjoying the scene. When asked ""what's all this then?"" he manages to croak out the expected reply, ludicrous given the obviousness of what happened. The victim ends up killing himself as a result, sparking off a riot. another interesting inmate is the intellectual trying to fight the system in his own non-violent way, equally unsuccessfully. Frankly, there's really not a lot of plot, this movie is mostly about the characters and the conditions in places like these that appear to sadly be the same in a lot of different countries and cultures. It is reminiscent of ""Bad Boys"" starring Sean Penn that came out in the US about the same time, which had a bit more plot than this movie, but was equally bleak in it's portrayal of life inside a juvenile offenders prison/borstal/reform school."

Among them are the huge breasted evangelical radio preacher Eufaula Roop (Ann Marie) who mounts Martin Bormann inside a coffin; a salesman who gives oral pleasure to a large breasted housewife (Candy Samples); and the very large African American Junkyard Sal (June Mack) who sleeps with her working class employees. Finally, there is Lamar, who anally rapes his large breasted wife Lavonia (Kitten Natividad) after she tries having vaginal sex. Afterwards, she kicks him in the groin.While Lamar heads off to his junkyard work, Lavonia spots a young man skinny dipping in a lake. She sneaks off and undresses, then jumps the boy from behind and proceeds to mount and rape him. The young man soon escapes, but she dives down, catches him underwater by giving him oral sex and then overpowers him. After he succumbs to her, she learns his name is Rhett and that he is fourteen. Later on, the aforementioned salesman comes to her home and she ends up having sex with him, too.Meanwhile, Lamar, who previously turned down Junkyard Sal's invitation for sex, gets called to her office where she meets him in her underwear. She locks him inside and threatens to fire him if he does not succumb to her. Lamar, who we are told needs money for correspondent school, lies down on her bed. She forces herself on him in numerous sexual positions. After a while, she lets Lamar have anal sex with her and gives in when a suddenly enthusiastic Lamar stops her from continuing into other positions.

In a motel room, Lavonia rapes the unconscious Lamar by first triggering an erection via oral sex and then by finally having vaginal sex with him using a sock as protection. She frees him to test if she changed his ways, but he runs away. Back home, Lavonia has sex with a truck driver. As she checks the clock smiling, Lamar returns. A fight ensues and Lavonia helps Lamar by burning the truck driver's scrotum with a light bulb.Lamar takes Lavonia and himself into dentist/marriage counselor Asa Lavender (Robert Pearson).

Suddenly she takes her robe off, sits down on him and rapes him, all the while preaching to her listeners about his salvation. Lamar heads off home, punches the truck driver and has vaginal sex with Lavonia.After Eufaula Roop leans back on her chair and moans, the teenager Rhett climbs from under her desk and she takes him to the bathtub.The narrator heads off to his own home, where the teenager Rhett, his son, has anal sex with the narrator's huge breasted younger Austrian wife, SuperSoul (Uschi Digard)."
Rock 'n' Roll High School,1979,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0079813/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Ramones fanatic and delinquent Riff Randell battles it out with the strict new principal of Vince Lombardi High School, Miss Togar, with help from theRamones. Vince Lombardi High School keeps losing principals to nervous breakdowns because of the students' love of rock 'n' roll and their disregard of education. The putative leader of the students is Riff Randell, who loves the music of the Ramones. A new principal, the rock-music-hating Miss Evelyn Togar, is brought in and promises to put an end to the music craze. When Miss Togar and a group of parents attempt to burn a pile of rock records, the students take over the high school, joined by the Ramones, who are made honorary students. When the police are summoned and demand that the students evacuate the building, they do so, which leads to an explosive finale.—Rick Gregory <rag.apa@email.apa.org> The school board meets to welcome Miss Evelyn Togar (Mary Woronov), Vince Lombardi High School's new principal -- the old principal having been driven insane by the unruly students. Riff Randell (P.J. Soles) and her nerdy friend Kate Rambeau (Dey Young) hijack the PA system to play some music (""Sheena Is a Punk Rocker""). Miss Togar interupts the dance party and gives them both detention. Miss Togar then announces to the assembled students that Vince Lombardi High School has the worst academic standing in California. Three principals in a row have suffered nervous breakdowns because the student body cares about nothing but rock and roll music. Miss Togar vows to the students that she will clean up the school and make it a center of learning. Intimidated, the kids rush off to their classes.Kate has a crush on the quarterback, Tom Roberts (Vincent Van Patten), who has the hots for Riff. Tom is shy with girls -- all he can think of to talk about is the weather -- so rather than ask Riff out, he goes to see the school's fixer, Eaglebauer (Clint Howard), who has an office in the boys' restroom. Eaglebauer agrees to get Tom a date with Riff. His task becomes complicated the very next day when Kate asks him to get her a date with Tom.Riff, an aspiring singer and songwriter, has written a song called ""Rock 'n' Roll High School"" for her favorite band, the Ramones. Her heart belongs to lead singerJoey Ramone, and she hopes that one day she'll be able to give the song to Joey and that the band will record it.Miss Togar sends her two geek minions, hall monitors Fritz Hansel (Loren Lester) and Fritz Gretel (Daniel Davies), to summon Mr. McGree (Paul Bartel), the music teacher, and Coach Steroid (Alix Elias), the gym teacher, to the science lab. Togar has been researching the effects of rock music. She shares her findings with Mr. McGree and Coach Steroid, and performs a demonstration: Ramones music played at high decibel levels makes mice explode. Meanwhile the girls' gym class, left unsupervised, is rocking out to unauthorized music -- Riff singing along to her demo tape of ""Rock 'n' Roll High School"". Fritz Hansel and Fritz Gretel happen by and rat the girls out, but before Togar arrives, the class goes back to the boring calisthenics they were supposed to be doing.In the girls' locker room, Riff announces that the Ramones are coming to town to give a concert and she plans to go. The other girls, though enthusiastic, can't take time away from school to wait in the ticket line for three days. Riff resolves to get tickets for everyone.At the concert hall, Riff is first in line. She sets up a folding lounge chair and settles in to wait. Back at school, Kate gives Miss Togar notes with increasingly implausible excuses to cover for Riff's absence: the death of her mother, the death of her father, and the death of her goldfish. (Hansel and Gretel disprove this excuse by producing the goldfish, which seems perfectly healthy until one of them swallows it.) The ticket line gets longer and a groupie, Angel Dust (Lynn Farrell), cuts in front of Riff to claim the first place in line. Their argument is interrupted by the arrival of the Ramones in a big old convertible, singing ""I Just Want to Have Something to Do."" The band's manager recognizes Angel Dust and invites her to come in with the band, much to Riff's chagrin.When the ticket window finally opens, Riff buys 100 tickets and later distributes them at school. Miss Togar gets wind of the concert and demands that Riff and Kate surrender their tickets. When they refuse, Togar lets the hall monitors take the tickets by force (""body search!""). Disheveled and despondent at the prospect of missing the concert, the girls retreat to Riff's house to do homework.Meanwhile, Eaglebauer is with Tom in Tom's tricked-out van, coaching him on how to ask Riff for a date. Tom calls just as Kate confesses to Riff that she thinks Tom will soon ask her (Kate) out. Kate is furious when Riff agrees to go out with Tom, but Riff assures her that she only accepted so she can fix up Tom and Kate.In Riff's car, Kate and Riff hear a DJ giving away a pair of Ramones tickets on the radio. Frantic to win the tickets, Riff pulls the car over and they pull a man out of a phone booth (the poor guy's proposing to his girlfriend) so they can use the phone. When they hear they've won, Riff calls Tom to break their date and the girls rush back to Riff's place to dress for the show.That evening, concert-goers file into the club, which is growing crowded. The kindly Mr. McGree attends out of curiosity, but his outdated idea of cool clubwear (a '50s-era beret and a '60s-era scarf) elicits some snickers. A large white mouse is denied admission -- the staff is afraid the music will cause him to explode -- until he produces a pair of noise-canceling headphones. An Indian chief in full feathered headdress is also attending.Riff and Kate are introduced on stage by the DJ who ran the ticket contest, Screamin' Steve Stevens (Don Steele). Offered the chance to say a few words to the crowd and the radio audience (which includes Miss Togar), Riff says ""On behalf of the students from Vince Lombardi High who are here tonight, I'd just like to say one thing: Screw you, Principal Togar, we made it to the concert anyway!""Screamin' Steve tries to get Riff and Kate backstage to meet the band, but the Ramones' manager isn't having any, and tells Angel Dust, the groupie, to see the girls back to their seats. The crowd is revved up and shouting ""hey, ho! let's go!"" when the band takes the stage to open with ""Blitzkrieg Bop."" Riff has to encourage Kate to get into it, but Kate begins to loosen up and enjoy herself during the next song, ""Teenage Lobotomy."" During the following number, ""California Sun,"" Angel attempts to steal the song Riff wrote. Tom, who has come to the concert with Eaglebauer, chases her and gets hold of the package when Angel trips over a cokehead who's spilled his powder on the floor. Riff offhandedly thanks Tom for his help and runs back to the concert. Tom sees that only Kate really cares about him and they agree to be friends. Back on stage, Joey (reading a note from Riff) dedicates the next song, ""She's the One,"" to Tom and Kate.At the same time Miss Togar's minions, Hansel and Gretel, crash the concert looking for Riff. Instead they find Angel Dust in the Ramones' dressing room. When Angel Dust mouths off to them, they yell ""body search!"" and attack her. Riff eventually gets backstage to give Joey her song.A few days later, Miss Togar and several concerned parents hold a rally where they try to burn a pile of Ramones records in front of the school. Riff and Tom throw a bowl of water at the bonfire and at Miss Togar. When most of the students begin to riot, the Ramones arrive and all the students cheer for them. Taking over the group, Riff, Tom, Kate, Eaglebauer and others storm the school and throw a large climactic party. Mr. McGree, finally seeing the ruthless and authoritarian figure that Miss Togar has become, defects and joins the students -- and the party -- in the school. Hansel and Gretel sneak in to stop the party, but when they're discovered hiding in a laundry cart, the Ramones themselves push the cart out of a third floor window. Miss Togar's henchmen end up in bandages and casts with multiple injuries.During the party, Riff announces that the Ramones are honorary members of the student body. The Ramones give Riff a Ramones jacket and makes her an honorary member of their band. The band plays ""Do You Wanna Dance"" while Kate and Tom dance together and make out, having found love at last. The students proceed to party and wreck most of the building with the loud music.But that evening, a furious Miss Togar calls the police and the building is surrounded by riot officers led by Chief Klein (Dick Miller). When Miss Togar, speaking through a bullhorn, demands that the students stop the festivities, Riff responds by destroying all the mid-term exams and all the student records with a chainsaw. More angry than ever, Miss Togar and Chief Klein threaten to storm the building with tear gas unless the students exit the premises within five minutes.With few options left, Kate and Eaglebauer devise a bomb in the laboratory. Aware that their party is finally over, the Ramones, Riff, Kate, Tom, Eaglebauer, Mr. McGree, and all the students quietly file out of the building where the riot police are poised to attack. Riff steps forward and tells Miss Togar that if she wants to have her school back, she can. When a surprised Togar asks Riff what she would have done with the school anyway, Riff says ""Rock the roof off it! Hit it, Marky!"" -- and the band launches into Riff's song, ""Rock 'n' Roll High School."" The students and Ramones resume their party and Riff detonates the bomb. The school explodes spectacularly.As Vince Lombardi High School burns, fire trucks arrive. The students are led away, still happy and partying, to police buses waiting to take them to jail, while Miss Togar is taken away in an ambulance in a straight-jacket mumbling ""detention"" over and over. She has become the latest principle to be carted away to a mental hospital."

While out on deck, Alec sees a handsome black Arabian stallion being forced into its pen above decks by some cruel men, using a bullwhip to get the frightened animal into its quarters. Returning to his father's card game, Alec takes some sugar cubes from the coffee tray & brings them to the stall where the horse is tied up. Placing them on the railing of the door, Alec then hides from sight. Within minutes the animal has taken the cubes. As Alec turns around he is grabbed & roughly accosted by the mean-looking owner of the horse, who shouts menacingly in a foreign language before letting him go. Alec quickly returns to his cabin.That night, Alec's father shows him his winnings from the card game. Alec receives a pocketknife and a small carving of a horse. His father tells him the horse is Bucephalus, the horse of Alexander the Great. Alec puts the Bucephalus carving on a shelf and falls asleep.Later that night, the carving is illuminated with a bright orange light. The ship pitches violently and Alec is thrown from his bunk onto the cabin floor. Grabbing the carving & his pocketknife, Alec gets to his feet and his dad throws a lifejacket over him. As the two of them stagger out into the hall they discover frightened passengers fleeing their rooms. Alec's dad sees water pouring in through a door, and they make their way onto the deck. As Alec looks up he sees the superstructure of the ship blazing with fire. His dad leaves him below with instructions to hang on to a rail, and goes to the boat deck. As Alec stays put he hears the horse in its pen, and decides to set the animal free and give him his chance to fight for life. Fighting his way to the door, he gets it open, but is attacked again by the horse's owner who cuts the lifejacket from Alec's body with a knife. Seeing this, Alec's dad leaps onto the man from the upper deck & throws him against the rail. In seconds the man has disappeared. The horse breaks the ropes holding him in & charges out onto the deck.Alec watches helplessly as the horse jumps the railing & into the water. A wave then washes over the ship, sending Alec backwards into the railing. Suddenly the railing gives way & Alec plummets into the water, helpless. Hearing the stallion and seeing its head above the water, its ropes caught in the propeller, Alec swims over & cuts the rope, freeing the stallion. He and the horse swim clear as the Drake, ablaze with fire, goes down by the head - taking everyone but Alec & the horse.The following day Alec finds himself washed up on a remote island, apparently the only human survivor of the sinking of the Drake. Still carrying the Bucephalus carving & his knife, Alec starts trying to figure out how to survive. Finding a cave, he makes a fire and starts catching fish. He eventually discovers he is not alone - the horse has also survived, and is trapped with its ropes caught on some rocks. At first the frightened animal is wary of Alec, but he gets close enough to cut the ropes and free the horse, which shakes off the ropes & flees. Alec follows the horse's tracks, but they vanish in the sand.Later, asleep on a beach, Alec is visited by an uninvited guest; an Asp Cobra. As Alec comes to he sees the reptile hissing, its hood spread, ready to strike. Alec, frozen with fear, tries to back away, but the snake hisses more aggressively. Suddenly, the horse appears, and pounds its sharp hooves on the cobra, killing the reptile. Again the horse vanishes as quickly as it appeared.More and more, Alec begins to encounter the beautiful horse, and the two of them forge a strong bond, with Alec feeding the animal and bringing it fresh water, with the horse allowing Alec to ride him bareback. The bond between the boy & the horse becomes so entwined that when a rescue boat finds Alec, he refuses to leave without his beloved animal, and the horse refuses to let Alec go. The men on the rescue boat tether the horse and help the animal to a larger ship, and Alec & the horse - who he names 'The Black' - are on their way home to America.Back home in the midwest U.S.A., Alec's mother is enormously relieved her son is alive but also grieving the loss of her husband, and expresses her thanks to The Black for saving Alec's life by allowing Alec to keep the horse in their backyard. Unfortunately, one day as the garbage collectors are coming round, a hat on the man's head triggers a fear in the Black's mind, and the animal is racing through the streets. Alec goes after the horse, and follows its trail to a barn owned by Henry Dailey - a former jockey & horse trainer. Alec inquires about learning to ride the Black, but Dailey is at first skeptical - no papers exist, and he's considered a wild stallion. However, Dailey agrees to teach Alec the ways of riding.The two of them, along with the Black, undergo frequent, rigorous training in riding and saddling a horse. At first the Black is reluctant to allow a saddle but eventually becomes used to it, and soon Alec & the Black are making runs on a racetrack.While at a movie theater, Alec sees an ad about an upcoming horse race, featuring two of the most famous horses & jockeys in the United States. Dailey gets in contact with a reporter who comes to watch Alec & The Black on the track one stormy night, and he writes a story on it - leading to a challenge match between The Black & the two Thoroughbreds. The Black is billed as a 'Mystery Horse' challenging the Thoroughbreds. Soon, promotions about the upcoming challenge are sprouting up everywhere, and even Alec's mother takes notice.Eventually Alec reveals the truth to his mother; the Black is the 'Mystery Horse' challenging the others, and Alec will be riding him. At first Alec's mother refuses, fearing the worst after losing her husband. After talking with Henry and Alec again, though, Alec reveals the carving of Bucephalus and how he got it - and when. His mother relents & allows Alec to ride the Black in the challenge.On race day, Alec suits up with Henry, and the other jockeys are stunned to find a rider half their size as their opponent. They smugly sneer that Alec won't be able to control a horse the size of the Black.As they come out and prepare to enter the gates, one of the horses rears up and start kicking at the Black's feet. The Black defends himself, but it takes some effort to get the horses under control. The Black suffers a bloody wound to his lower front leg. The three horses finally make it into the starting gate.Inside the starting gate, Alec looks down and sees the bloody wound to the Black's leg. As the gates open, Alec tries to restrain the Black, fearing that running would aggravate the wound. The Black is slowed, but after a few seconds shows Alec that he wants to race. Although far behind, the Black picks up speed and begins to close the gap on the other two horses. As the three horses exit the last turn and head down the home stretch, Alec and the Black pass the first horse - then the second - and seconds later Alec & the Black are across the finish line, triumphant. Alec waves his hands in the air & Henry and Alec's mother cheer wildly from the stands. The Black's leg is bandaged, and Alec & the Black proudly pose for the cameras with their winnings. The film ends showing Alec & the Black in their times alone, on the island."
Over the Edge,1979,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0079688/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A group of bored teenagers rebels against authority in the community of New Granada after the death of one of their own. Carl (Michael Kramer) and his friends, Ritchie (Matt Dillon), Claude (Tom Fergus), and Johnny (Tiger Thompson) are hanging out at The Rec, a recreation center for the kids in New Grenada, a planned community full of condominiums and town homes. The Rec is pretty much the only thing in town for the children, as the Homeowners Association totally forgot about the fact that nearly 25% of the population of New Grenada is under the age of 15. So, naturally, the kids find themselves some other ways to have fun; sex, drugs, alcohol, vandalism, and rock n roll. One of the first scenes shown is Mark Perry (Vincent Spano), and his friend shooting his B.B. gun at oncoming cars on the overpass. However, when they hit a police cruiser, they laugh and cheer, and decide to leave before the cop sees them. They hop on their bikes, and ride down the road, passing Carl and Ritchie, who, when warned by the boys about cops, dive into the weeds behind an electric control box. The police car pulls up, and out steps Sgt. Doberman (Harry Northup), the most hated cop in town. He sees the boys, and, upon frisking them, finds a three-inch pocketknife on Ritchie. He take the boys to the station, and calls Carl's father, Fred Willat (Andy Romano), warning him about Carl's behavior.Fred is the local Cadillac salesman, an upper middle class job. Before getting Doberman's call, is talking to Jerry Cole (Richard Jamison), president of the Homeowners Association, about getting Mr. Sloan (Lane Smith), a wealthy Texas Landowner, to come to see the land across the street from The Rec, with hopes of building an industrial park there. Back at the police station, Doberman is questioning Ritchie and Carl about who had the gun, and Ritchie tells them that he has only 1 law; A kid who tells on another kid is a dead kid. Ritchie is then taken out of the room, and Doberman continues lecturing Carl about where hes going to end up if he keeps this up; The Hill, a correction center for the kids in the area. Then Carl and his father drive home, where Sandra Willat (Ellen Geer), waits. But instead of talking to his mother, Carl runs upstairs, and locks himself in his room, blaring the Cheap Trick.The next day at school, Carl and Ritchie tell Claude about their escapades with the police, and Claude announces that he took speed to prepare for the upcoming test. He then looks at a slide of a painting, and instead of seeing the actual painting he sees this mangled, horrid thing. Then they go to an assembly about the recent vandalism on the highway, where Carl gets a look at the love of his life, Cory (Pamela Ludwig), who hes absolutely crazy about. Later, after school, Carl is getting dressed to go out, once again listening to his music, only this time, its The Ramones. When Carl is dressed, he goes downstairs and asks his father about the land across from The Rec. but, upon getting an answer different from what he wanted, leaves for The Rec.The Rec closes at six o'clock p.m., but that doesn't stop the kids from having fun. The kids bring pot, music, and alcohol to The Rec after hours, and have their own little party, where Claude ends up buying a gram of hash from Tip (Eric Lalich), a friend. But the party moves when an announcement about a party at a boys house is made. The party is your basic teens; sex, drugs, beer, and Van Halen. Carl sees Cory on the couch making out with Mark, the boy who shot the cop car, and got Carl and Ritchie busted. Mark then warns Carl about mentioning his name to the cops, and when Carl gives a sarcastic remark, he leaves. Carl gets upset with Cory, telling her that she could do a lot better than Mark. Carl then leaves, followed (unknowingly) by Mark and his friend. While Carl is walking home alone, they jump him, beat him up, and take his money. When Carl gets home, he tries to avoid his parents seeing the cuts and bruises, but fails. Carl gets questioned, but, when refusing to tell them who jumped him, runs upstairs and locks himself in his room. Fred and Jerry Cole then talk about making sure The Rec is closed the next day, when Sloan comes to visit.The next day at The Rec, everyone is talking about Carl's event. But he only releases the names to Claude, Ritchie, Johnny, and Alan (Brian Parker), another friend of theirs. While they're talking, Julia (Julia Pomeroy), The Rec counselor, goes outside to talk to Doberman about The Rec staying open. Doberman goes inside and searches Claude, finding the gram of hash in his pocket, and taking him in. However, when they walk outside, Ritchie is standing on the cop car, and makes the cops chase him around the grounds. When the cops finally leave, Carl, and Ritchie go to get sodas, where Ritchie gives Carl firecrackers. They then get on their bikes and ride around the neighborhood, where they find Cory and her best friend Abby (Kim Kliner) running out of a house, carrying a plastic bag. They stop them, and grab the bag, finding a gun in it, which the girls stole from the house. They then all go to a half-finished town home, which Carl and Ritchie call their condo. After planning a picnic with a gun Cory gets up and starts dancing, with the gun in her hand, pointing it at Carl playfully. But the gun goes off, and Carl scares everyone into thinking he is shot. The group then goes their separate ways. When Carl gets home, he sees Sloan's car in the driveway, and, upset at his father, places the firecrackers given to him by Ritchie in the cars engine, so that when the car is turned on, they will light. Sloan and his boys, scared, then leave, but not before warning Fred that if he doesn't stop to listen to his son, it will come back to bite him.The next day, Carl calls Claude and Johnny, telling them to come to the picnic. They all show up, and after shooting the gun, and realizing that Carl is the only one with any sense of aim at all, they start walking. During the walk, Claude tells them that it was Tip who sold him the hash, and Cory announces that Tip had recently gotten busted for possession. They then decide to pay Tip a visit, and while the boys hold Tip down and interrogate him, the girls ransack his kitchen. Tip tells them that he told Doberman who he sold the hash to, because he was arrested. Ritchie then points the gun at him, and Johnny lights a firecracker, making a gun sound. Before leaving, the boys throw Tip in the water under his porch. Before Cory and Abby leave Carl and Ritchie, Cory runs over to Carl and gives him a kiss, showing him that she likes him as much as he likes her.When Carl gets home, he is told by his mother and father that he is forbidden to see Claude or Ritchie any longer, and that The Rec will be closed. Carl gets in a fight with his father, and when Carl takes a swing at him, he smacks him across the face, causing him to, once again, lock himself in his room. The next day at school, in science class, Carl sees Tips mother (Irene Lalich), and the schools principal (Molly McCarthy) talking in a connected classroom. Tips mother tells the principal the names of the boys that assaulted her son, and this causes Carl to snap. He then grabs Ritchie in the hallway and they run home. Ritchie grabs his gun, and they steal his mothers car, leaving town. However, Doberman sees them leave, and chases them. During the chase, Carl begs Ritchie to throw the gun out of the car, but he refuses. The car then gets flipped over, the two boys running in opposite directions. Ritchie points the gun at Doberman, who mistakes it for loaded, so Doberman shoots and kills Ritchie. Carl then runs away to his condo, but not before calling Johnny to confirm that Ritchie is really dead, and calling Cory to tell her to meet him. She brings a sleeping bag, and they spend the night together. After Cory leaves in the morning, Carl runs home to grab money, and along the way he sees Mark riding his dirt bike. He takes Marks B.B. gun, and shoots him in the shoulder (not harming him), causing him to flip over his bike. Mark then sits down with Carl, talking about what they're going to do about the parent situation. They then decide that their fight was stupid, and they make up. Then Carl goes home, and upon climbing into the house through an upstairs window, he sees his mother on the phone with his father about a big meeting at the school that night, to talk about the new trend of violence with the children. He then locks himself in his mothers room, and gets on the phone, asking his parents if they wish he got shot, too.After leaving his home that night, Carl goes to The Rec, where, all of his friends are. They then make a plan to show the parents that they need to listen to them; lock them in the schools auditorium, and wreck the school. Carl climbs onto the roof, entering the school through a sun window above a science classroom. The kids then take their bike chains and lock the gates surrounding the auditorium. The children decide that the only thing that will make them feel better is to trash the school, and all of the cars in the parking lot. However, when they find guns, all hell breaks loose. The kids run around shooting cars, causing massive explosions. When Cory almost gets blown up by an explosion caused by Mark, and cant find Carl, Claude and Johnny agree to take her home, but not before Johnny gives a phone to Julia, who is sitting by a gate in the school. Julia calls the police, and as soon as they hear sirens, all of the kids split, some getting arrested. The police unlock the auditorium doors, and Doberman runs out to find Carl. He gets in a cop car, and drives down the road until he finds Carl. He handcuffs him to the backseat, and tells him that he will have to go to The Hill. But, Mark is waiting down the road with his B.B. gun, and shoots the car, causing Doberman to run it off the road, into, of all buildings, The Rec. Doberman gets knocked out, and The Rec catches on fire. Carl grabs Dobermans keys, and unlocks himself from the car. He runs away, and stops and turns around just in time to see The Rec blow up. He then for sure knows that Doberman died.The final scene shows Carl in the morning, coming handcuffed out of the police station. Carl stops and hugs his parents, and is then escorted onto a bus (full of other kids involved with the school incident, including Mark and Abby) by Lincoln (Mike Osborne), another police officer. He is sat at the back of the bus, and driven down the highway to The Hill. But, when they go under the overpass, (the same one that Mark was shooting off of earlier) they see Claude, Johnny, and Cory waving from above. Carl then turns around to face the front of the bus, quite content with the fact that his friends are safe, and that Cory still loves him."

However, she tells him that she has to visit someone on the weekend. Maria though does not divulge the fact that she is going to visit her husband.

Working for the Utah state government as a report writer, Charles Richardson reminisces about his past love affair with Laura Connolly, with who he was immediately attracted upon first sight when she worked in the file section of his office. Their relationship was despite Laura then being married to ex-football player Jim, nicknamed Ox, he bringing an adolescent daughter, Rebecca, into their blended family. When she and Charlie met, Laura was already on a trial separation from Ox, which always tainted Laura and Charlie's relationship in her sense of guilt as Ox never did anything bad to precipitate that separation. Charlie can't help but think about Laura as he is still in love with her and wants to get back together with her, their relationship which ended when she returned to Ox, who never knew about Charlie in her life. Charlie's thoughts about Laura are only one complication in his life, those other complicating people being: his perpetually ""glass-half-full"" sister Susan, who shares the house he inherited from their grandmother; his longtime best friend Sam Maguire, a men's garment salesman who is even less motivated with work than Charlie; his mother Clara, whose eccentricities and suicidal tendencies may solely be a cry for attention; Clara's current husband Pete, who wants a bromance with Charlie despite knowing Charlie doesn't much like him; his boss, Mr. Patterson, who continually uses him as a guidance counselor in issues related to his teenage son; and his typist Betty, who is attracted to Charlie herself not knowing about his and Laura's past relationship, and who Charlie consciously and unconsciously uses in knowing she still is in touch with Laura.—Huggo Charles is a Salt Lake City civil servant who (*LOVES*) Laura, a lovely housewife with a lovely stepdaughter and an A-frame-selling, ex-quarterback husband named Ox.

He listens to Janis Joplin and dreams of getting Laura back once and for all. He does everything in his power to win her back from Ox, and the lengths he goes to provide the structure of the film in this bittersweet romantic comedy...a film that explores what happened to the Woodstock generation when they transcended their idealism (i.e. it was expected that they fall in love and face the music of routine). Charles is perhaps the quintessential saint of this ideology.—thustlebird"

Reno is having difficulties to pay his bills, while is obsessed painting his masterpiece, a buffalo with a hypnotic eye. When a punk band moves to his building playing day and night, Reno cannot sleep and drives insane, going to the streets with a driller, killing homeless derelicts. When the art dealer calls his painting a mockery, and Carol returns to her husband, leaving him alone, Reno goes totally mad.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil New York City. Reno Miller, a scruffy young artist, enters a small Catholic church in Spanish Harlem where he walks to the front where an elderly bearded man is kneeling and chanting ""pity the sinners"" over and over. Reno seems to recognize the man as his long-lost father, whom is now apparently a derelict. The old man unclasps a hand and grabs Reno's hand. Reno runs, grabs his girlfriend Carol, who accompanied him to the church, and leaves. They ride in a taxi towards downtown, and Reno calls the man a ""degenerate"" and a ""bum"". Evidently, the derelict had a piece of paper with Reno's name and phone number and requested a meeting at the church to talk to him. Reno, despite knowing that the derelict was his father, denies knowing him to Carol. Reno and Carol go to pick up Pamela, their other roommate, who is in a local bar watching a punk rock band perform.The next morning, Reno hears Pamela trying to drill a hole in the door, and he does it for her since Pamela is constantly spaced out being an ex-junkie. Reno, Carol, and Pamela all live together in a seedy apartment in the Union Square area of Manhattan and are struggling to get by. Reno complains about the bills for the utilities they get from the water, to the electricity, and to the telephone bill and of the long distance, hour-long, phone calls that Pamela and Carol made in the past month. In frustration, Reno throws the phone out of a window.Later, Reno has a dream about the mysterious bearded man and about the power drill that he used earlier. Reno hates his neighborhood where homeless derelicts reside on the streets around his apartment building. Reno goes to see Dalton, a flamboyantly gay art gallery owner and tells him that he is currently working on a masterpiece painting (which is a giant painting of a buffalo against a multi-colored landscape). Reno says that he needs another week and asks for a loan of $500 to pay for his rent. But Dalton refuses, saying that he has lent enough money to Reno this past year for a variety of reasons from medical bills to utility bills, to Reno's artwork which includes paint and numerous canvases. But Dalton tells Reno that if he finishes the painting in one week and if he likes it, he will buy it and give Reno whatever money he needs to help him out.Strapped for money, since neither Reno or Pamela have bank accounts, Carol writes a check for $500 for the rent and gives it to the grumpy landlord Al, which she claims is her alimony check that her ex-husband gives her. The landlord takes the check, but tells Carol that they are still a month behind on the rent, and in a few days, on the 1st of the month, they will be two months behind and he wants the rest of the money soon.The following day, Tony Coca-Cola and the Roosters, a punk rock band that Pamela hangs around, move into an apartment near Reno's and soon begin practicing their music. The loud music from the band make Reno more unnerved and frustrated. That night, Reno, Carol, and Pamela watch TV since they have no money and cannot go out since Reno has to spend what little money he has on utilities, and Pamela apparently squanders what money she makes on drugs. During the commercials, they watch a TV advertisement for a Porto-Pack, a battery pack with allows a person to walk around with electrical appliances.At 2:00 AM in the morning, while trying to work on his painting, Reno becomes more agitated from the loud music that Tony and his band continue to play. He sees an image of himself saturated in blood, and goes outside into the dark streets for a walk. At the foot of a garbage-strewn alley, Reno sees an elderly derelict sleeping, and stands him up. It seems that Reno is going to accost the man, but he ducks into the alley with him when they see a group of teenage gang members chasing another bum in the street and run right past them. Reno drops the bum to the ground and walks off, vowing that he will not end up like him or his derelict father.The next day, Carol gets a letter from her ex-husband Stephen, who sends her a photo of them together as well as a $100 note, saying that he misses her and wants her to return to him. Meanwhile, Reno becomes more angry and agitated when Tony and his band continue to play their music day and night and complains to the landlord about the loud music. But the landlord refuses to do anything because Tony and his band don't bother him, (which implies that the band pays their rent and probably bribe money, whereas Reno doesn't). However, the landlord gives Reno a gift of a skinned rabbit for dinner to show that there are no hard feelings. Reno takes the carcass of the rabbit home to his apartment, and while preparing it for dinner, repeatedly stabs it with a knife (shades of 'Repulsion').The next day, Reno eyes the Porto-Pack sitting in the window at a small hardware store on sale for $19.95. After checking to see if he has enough money on him, which apparently he does, Reno goes inside the hardware store and purchases the Porto-Pack. Later that afternoon, a troubled Reno tries to sleep when the band finally stops playing loud music for a short while, but he hears voices calling out his name, and he sees an image of Carol with her eyes cut out. That night, Reno takes the Porto-Pack and goes out, with the drill attached to it. Reno sees another homeless bum sleeping inside an abandoned building, and he drills the bum in the chest, killing him.The following evening, Reno, Carol, and Pamela have tickets to see Tony Coca-Cola and the Roosters at a local nightclub. At the club, Pamela hangs out with the band, while Reno and Carol talk about where they stand with their relationship and Carol tells him that her ex-husband has been writing to her asking her to come back to him. A little later, while Reno plays a pinball machine, Pamela asks Reno about the painting that he's working on and suggests that in an attempt to get more money for the rent and bills, Reno has sexual relations with Dalton. Reno shrugs it off with slight disgust. The band finally gets to play, where Reno quickly becomes more agitated from the loud music and the crowd around him. Reno leaves the club unnoticed while Carol and Pamela dance and make out with each other.Driven to the edge, Reno returns to his apartment, grabs the drill with the battery pack, and goes out on a ""drilling spree"". All night long, Reno runs through the streets killing one homeless bum after another, starting with a bum sleeping on the sidewalk, then another bum in a subway station, then a drinking derelict on the street. Reno passes a small bus stop where he sees a weird and spaced out bum hanging around and harassing two men waiting for a late-night bus. When the men board the passing bus, leaving the bum alone, Reno attacks the bum, drilling him in the back. Reno further attacks two more bums, drilling one and chasing the second down the street, and drilling him in the back. He ends his killing spree by approaching a derelict asleep in a pile of garbage bags, and drills the man in the forehead. Reno returns home for the night to sleep.Some time later, Tony visits Reno at this apartment where the spaced out rock star comments on his paintings and asks Reno to paint a portrait of him. After Tony reluctantly agrees to pose for Reno's demand of $500 (rent money), he says that they need to start right away.The next morning, Carol reads the newspaper which has one article of a man killed with a power drill. Reno sees an image of his initial drill killing and his own bloody image, and he snatches the paper away from Carol and accuses of her trying to drive him crazy. Later, Pamela brings home a take-out pizza for dinner. As Carol and Pamela eat their plain cheese slices, they watch with slight disgust as Reno gobbles down slice after slice of pizza with green peppers on it like some famished animal. While scarfing down his fourth pizza slice, Reno tells Pamela to ask Carol if she wants some pizza with green peppers on it (even though Carol is sitting right beside him). Carol angrily throws a slice of pizza in Reno's face and leaves. Carol goes out to a nearby payphone and calls Stephen and tells him about wanting to leave Reno. Carol returns to the apartment to find a silly picture proclaiming ""I'm sorry"".Reno paints Tony has he poses, and at various times, plays his guitar and even makes out with Pamela who shows up. Nearby, a bum in a nearby alley, restless and indignant due to all the noise Tony makes, is attacked by Reno who drills his hands to a wall in a crude crucifix pose and then kills him. Afterwards, Reno goes to work on his painting and after nearly working all night, he approaches the sleeping Carol and Pamela in bed together and tells them that his painting is finally finished.The next day, Reno and Carol show the completed buffalo painting to Dalton. But Dalton declares the work of art ""unacceptable"", and leaves. Carol then yells at Reno for she is angry that he just sat in his chair with a blank expression on his face while Dalton yelled at him. The next morning, Reno awakes to an empty bed, and he chases Carol as she walks down the street with her suitcase, saying that she is finally leaving him and going back to her ex-husband. Reno tries to talk to her, and even grabs the suitcase away, but she keeps on walking. Pamela is devastated that her best friend and part-time lover has left, but Reno is beside himself with rage. He tries calling Carol and talks to her on the phone, but he is only talking to a dial tone.That evening, Reno, now completely demented, calls Dalton and invites him to come on over for he has something else to show to him, and Dalton (mistaking thinking that Reno is coming onto him) agrees to be there later with some wine. Dalton arrives at the apartment that evening, while Tony and his band are continuing to play their loud music, and Reno, dressed in all black clothing with his face pasty white and wearing blood-red lipstick, drills Dalton to death. A little later, Pamela returns to the apartment after hanging around Tony's band when she sees a bloody drill bit in the door and a dead Dalton hanging from it on the inside. Pamela backs away screaming, but Reno grabs her.Across town, Carol is back with Stephen at his apartment and while she goes to the bathroom to take a shower, Stephen prepares some tea. Reno sneaks into the apartment and drills Stephen in the back, and hides his body behind the counter. Carol, done showering, walks to the bedroom where Reno is lying under the bed covers. She turns out the lights, gets into bed, and tells ""Stephen"" to ""come here..."""

After ""The Poseidon Adventure"" (1972), in which the ship got flipped over by a tidal wave, the ship drifts bottom-up in the sea. While there are passengers still on-board waiting to be rescued, two rivaling salvage parties enter the ship in search of money, gold, and a small amount of plutonium.—Tom Zoerner <Tom.Zoerner@informatik.uni-erlangen.de> The film continues the story from the original movie's conclusion. The Poseidon is still afloat, and the six survivors of Reverend Scott's team have been rescued.

But his bouts of insanity are just beginning. A young rich orphan loses his fiancée to voodoo doll mischief on the part of his housekeeper who is jealous of his attentions. He digs his girlfriend up, cleans her out, stuffs her, and puts her in bed at the mansion. Following this, he tries out and disposes of a series of young maidens, trying to find the right replacement for her, and the disapproving housekeeper helps him with the disposals.—Ed Sutton <esutton@mindspring.com> Anna Völkl (Cinzia Monreale), the fiance of taxidermist Frank Wyler (Kieran Canter), dies of an illness in the hospital during a final kiss after Iris (Franca Stoppi), Frank's wet nurse and housekeeper, stabs a voodoo doll. Back at the villa, Iris then breastfeeds Frank for erotic lactation comfort.During Anna's funeral, Frank injects Anna's body with an embalming fluid preservative so that he can dig her body up and be with her forever. Unbeknownst to Frank, a funeral home employee sees him making the injection and becomes suspicious.At night, Frank digs up Anna's body at the cemetery. On the ride home, Frank gets a flat tire and while changing it for the spare, picks up an American hitchhiker, named Jan (Lucia D'Elia). While smoking pot, she offers some to Frank who declines because he is driving. The female hitchhiker then passes out in the car as Frank arrives back at the villa. Taking Anna's dead body from the van, Frank, begins stuffing Anna in his workshop. (Note: there are very, VERY graphic scenes involving Frank's disemboweling of Anna, and his efforts to install glass eyes into her sockets. Plus, Frank picks out Anna's heart and takes a bite of it.)When the hitchhiker wakes up and spots Anna's corpse, she panics and a struggle ensues. Frank tortures her by ripping off some of her fingernails with a pair of pliers before choking her to death. When Frank is not satisfied, Iris tries to comfort him once more, this time by masturbating him. Assisted by Frank, Iris chops up the hitchhiker's corpse in a bathtub and pours acid to dissolve the flesh (another very gory and graphic scene). Frank then buries the pieces in a hole in the woods.A few days later, a jogger (Anna Cardini) twists her ankle around Frank's home and he invites her in. They have sex on his bed, until Frank can't resist showing off Anna's corpse right next to them. Once more a fight ensues. Frank bites her neck and eats a huge chunk of her flesh. He and Iris burn her corpse in the furnace downstairs. But the female jogger is still alive and screams as she is incinerated alive.Another day or two later, Iris invites her old, eccentric relatives to dinner and announces her engagement to Frank. Yet Frank thinks otherwise and leaves her humiliated. The following day, while Iris is drunk in her room and Frank is out for a jog, the funeral home employee enters Frank's home to investigate, where he discovers Anna's body. Startled, he immediately leaves.That night, Frank picks up a woman at a disco. Fortunately for her, Frank just sends her off due to the arrival of Anna's twin sister Elena (played by Cinzia Monreale in a dual role). She asks to stay a few days while she sorts out Anna's estate.At the climax, Elena faints on seeing Anna's corpse seated in a chair in the foyer, and Iris approaches her with a knife before Frank intervenes. Frank kills Iris, but not before she badly injures him by stabbing him in the groin and ripping his left eye out. Frank, while Elena remains unconscious, incinerates Anna's body in the furnace so he can be with Elena. The funeral home employee then returns to confront Frank and finds him badly injured near the furnace in his basement. Frank passes out and dies.The funeral home employee takes Elena, who he thinks is Anna's deceased body, and returns it to the funeral home where he places it in a coffin for burial. While he is sealing the coffin Elena awakens, pushes the coffin open, and lets out a blood curdling scream...."

Zulu Dawn,1979,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080180/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A dramatization of the Battle of Isandlwana, where the British Army met its match against the Zulu nation. In 1879 South Africa, the administrators of the British Cape Colony have designs to eliminate the Zulus as a hindrance to their colonial economy. To that end, the British present King Cetshwayo with an impossible ultimatum to provoke a war they are sure they can win easily with their rifles and artillery against native spears. However, that war proves more difficult than the arrogant British commander, Lord Chelmsford, expects as his overburdened army fruitlessly searches for the elusive enemy. However, in the shadow of a hill called Isandlwana, the overconfident British army learns to its sorrow just how badly they have underestimated the tactical skill and might of the Zulu nation.—Kenneth Chisholm (kchishol@rogers.com) The film is set in British South Africa, in the province of Natal, in January 1879. The first half of the film revolves around the administrators and officials of Cape Colony, notably the supremely arrogant Lord Chelmsford (Peter O'Toole) and the scheming Sir Henry Bartle Frere (John Mills), who both wish to crush the neighbouring Zulu Empire, which is perceived as a threat to Cape Colony's emerging industrial economy. Bartle Frere issues an impossible ultimatum to the Zulu king, Cetshwayo (Simon Sabela), demanding that he dissolve the Zulu Empire. Cetshwayo refuses, providing Cape Colony with a pretext to invade Zululand. Despite objections from leading members of Cape Colony's high society and from Great Britain itself, Bartle Frere authorises Lord Chelmsford to lead a British invasion force into Zululand.The second half of the film focuses on the British invasion of Zululand and the lead-up to the climatic Battle of Isandlwana. The invading British army, laden with an immense network of supply wagons, invades Zululand and marches in the direction of Ulundi, the Zulu capital. British forces, eager to fight a large battle in which they can unleash their cutting-edge firearm military technology against the vast Zulu army, become increasingly frustrated as the main Zulu army refuses to attack the British, and fighting is restricted to a few small skirmishes between British and Zulu scouts.Concerned that their supply lines are becoming overstretched and that the main Zulu army is still at large, British troops begin torturing captive Zulu warriors in an effort to learn the location and tactics of the Zulu army. Halfway to Ulundi, Chelmsford halts his army at the base of Mount Isandhlwana, ignoring the advice of Boer attendants to entrench the camp and laager the supply wagons, leaving the camp dangerously exposed. During the night, Colonel Durnford (Burt Lancaster) and an escort of 50 mounted Basutos approach the camp. Lord Chelmsford then orders Durnford to return to his unit, bringing them to the camp immediately to reinforce Colonel Pulleine (Denholm Elliott). Lt. Vereker (Simon Ward) should join Durnford as aide-de-camp.Reacting to false intelligence, Chelmsford leads half of the British army, including the best infantry, cavalry and artillery units, on a wild goose chase far from the camp, in pursuit of a phantom Zulu army. On the day of battle (January 22), Durnford and his troops are arriving at 11:00 a.m. at the camp at Isandlwana. Meanwhile, the Zulu captives escape their torturers and regroup with the Zulu army, informing them of the British army's direction and strength. After having lunch with Colonel Pulleine and Lt. Vereker, Durnford quickly decides to send Vereker to scout the hills. Durnford then decides to take his own command out from the camp too, and scout the iNyoni heights.The entire Zulu army is later discovered by men of Lt. Vereker's troop of scouts, who chase a number of Zulu herdsmen, trying to hurry away their cattle, only to discover the main Zulu enemy force of thousands at the bottom of a valley. Lt. Vereker then sends Lt. Raw to warn the camp that it is about to be attacked.As Zulu impis descend upon the camp, Durnford's cavalry retreat to a donga in an effort to hold back the Zulu advance. Forced back, the British take heavy casualties, including the battery of Congreve rockets, which is overrun by the Zulus. Initially, the British infantry succeed in defending the camp, and Zulu forces retreat under a hail of artillery and small arms fire. British units defending the camp are now becoming dangerously spread-out, and are oblivious to Zulu forces moving round the sides of the mountain in an encircling move.As British infantrymen begin to run out of ammunition and the British cavalry are driven back towards the camp, Zulu warriors charge the British troops en masse, sustaining horrific casualties, but succeed in breaking the British lines. As British troops break and flee towards the camp, the battle breaks down into hand-to-hand fighting between British soldiers and Zulu warriors, amongst the débris of tents, fallen soldiers and supply wagons. Overwhelmed by the sheer number of Zulu warriors, British soldiers and their African allies are slaughtered in the camp, some being cut down as they attempt to flee back towards Natal. Colour-Sergeant-Major Williams (Bob Hoskins) sees many of his redcoated men being cut down by Zulu spears. Williams is stabbed in the back by a spear while attempting to save the life of one of his young soldiers, and having killed several Zulu soldiers with his bayonet after he runs out of ammo, dies at the hands of a large band of Zulus.As the British forces break apart, the one-armed Durnford becomes trapped in the camp. Hoping to save his men, Durnford orders his African cavalrymen to retreat. Remaining on foot at the battlefield, Durnford is killed alongside his infantrymen.During the last minutes of the battle, Colonel Pulleine entrusts the Queen's Colours of the 2nd battalion, 24th Regiment of Foot to two junior officers, Lts. Melvill (James Sebastian Faulkner) and Coghill (Christopher Cazenove), who attempt to carry them to safety in Natal, passing gruesome scenes as Zulu warriors hunt down British and African infantrymen attempting to flee across the river. While crossing the Buffalo River, the three lieutenants are cut down by Zulus. Coghill accompanies Melvill in his attempt to gallop the Union Flag back towards Natal. When Melvill nearly drowns while trying to cross the Buffalo River, Coghill turns to help him, and is ambushed by Zulu warriors. Coghill attempts to defend himself with his revolver, but is killed. Melvill is assegaied by Zulu warriors while defending the flag.The Colours (a Union Flag embroidered with the Regiment's insignia) are captured. In his dying moments, Vereker shoots and kills the Zulu wielding the Colours, and the Colours fall gracefully into the river, where they are carried out of reach. Vereker's fate remains unknown (though it is implied that he too gets killed).Seeing the battle lost, Pulleine returns to his tent to pen a last letter to his wife. He is discovered by one of the escaped Zulu prisoners and, unwilling to kill the young soldier, the elderly Pulleine allows himself to be killed in his tent by the Zulu and other warriors that storm in.In the evening, Chelmsford and the rest of the British army return to Isandlwana, to be greeted by the sight of their slaughtered comrades, and the news that a mass Zulu army has invaded Natal and laid siege to Rorke's Drift. Charles L. Norris-Newman (Ronald Lacey), a war correspondent for 'The Standard' also views the devastation (having accompanyed Chelmsford's expecition and so avoid the battle/massacre. The film ends with Zulu warriors in a silhouetted victory procession, dragging captured British artillery back to Ulundi."

Scavenger Hunt,1979,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0079858/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"To inherit a fortune, various addressees of a will must compete in a wild scavenger hunt to collect selected items, but cannot be simply bought. Milton Parker has made millions inventing and selling games. Upon his death, his relatives and domestic staff gather for the reading of the will. However, Old Mr. Parker is a game player to the last, and his will stipulates that a Scavenger Hunt will be held to determine the beneficiaries of his sizeable estate. The winning team gets all the money, the rest get nothing.—Afterburner <aburner@erols.com>, bearhawkpilot@gmail.com At his San Diego, California mansion, Milton Parker (Vincent Price), an elderly and wealthy game developer, is in poor health and plays one of his inventions in bed, competing against his young nurse (Carol Wayne). After losing, he suddenly dies.At the reading of his will that Sunday, Charles Bernstein (Robert Morley), Parker's attorney, announces to a room of invited family members and acquaintances that the millionaire recorded an audio message for them. In keeping with his motto, ""play to win,"" the inheritor of Parker's $200 million estate will be decided in a scavenger hunt. Each team will receive an identical list of clues identifying 100 items to obtain, and every item has a different point value. The group or person who earns the most points by 5:00 pm that day will inherit the Parker fortune.The five competing teams consist of the following groups: Mildred Carruthers (Cloris Leechman), Parker's greedy, widowed, dowager sister; Stuart Selsome (Richard Benjamin), her calculating attorney; and Georgie (Richard Masur), her grownup, but childlike son; Parker's nephews, Jeff (Dirk Benedict) and Kenny Stevens (Willie Aames); Parker's son-in-law Henry Motley (Tony Randall) and his four disobedient young children Jennifer, Michelle, Jason and Scott; the millionaire's personal staff of Henri (James Coco), the French chef; Jenkins (Roddy McDowell), the valet; Jackson (Cleavon Little), the chauffeur; and Babbette (Stephanie Faracy), the dim-witted French maid; and Marvin Dummitz (Richard Mulligan), a blundering taxicab driver, who did not know Parker, but inadvertently helped him gain control of the company after being responsible for a car accident years earlier in which Parker's business partner died. Believing she is the sole rightful heir, Mildred is furious about the game. When she refuses to let her stepdaughter Lisa (Maureen Teefy) to compete, Jeff and Kenny invite the young woman to join their team. Before distributing the lists, Bernstein reminds the competitors that items can be acquired by any means, except purchase, and they are to be stored in the assigned pens located on the estate. As soon as the groups receive the list, they speed away in different directions.Mildred, Stuart, and Georgie begin their quest by procuring a teddy bear at a carnival, but their next item proves to be more challenging as they remove a large safe from Stuart's office. After the elevator breaks down, Stuart tries to transport the heavy object down the stairs while George is determined to sabotage the effort. In a moment of good fortune, the safe falls out a window and conveniently lands in the backseat of their car.Next, Stuart notices another item on the list, a fox tail, tied to a parked motorcycle. As he unfastens the object, a biker gang and their leader, ""Scum,"" (Meat Loaf) accost him. Stuart emerges from the beating dazed and with his clothes in tatters, but the greedy and callous Mildred has no sympathy and screams that the 5:00 pm deadline is approaching.Elsewhere, the servants pose as plumbers to detach a toilet, worth 40 points, from a hotel bathroom and steal a cash register from a grocery store, while leaving behind the money. Thanks to the efficient Jenkins, the servants make good progress in the hunt, until they become locked in a chemistry laboratory while foraging for a microscope.Meanwhile, Marvin fumbles at the beginning as he tries several times to steal a Rolls-Royce automobile grille. Next, he breaks into a bridal shop to snatch a gown, but Sam (Scatman Crothers), the elderly security guard, catches him. After Marvin explains that he is the only team with one player in a very high-stakes scavenger hunt, Sam agrees to join him and share in any winnings. At a museum, the two develop a plan to procure a suit of armor: Marvin dresses as a mummy to distract visitors and guards, while Sam sneaks away wearing the metal outfit. However, Sam is knocked unconscious after falling down stairs in the cumbersome suit, with Marvin unaware of his partner's predicament. As Mildred, Stuart, and Georgie arrive at the museum to find the same item, they stumble upon the armored figure lying on the floor and store the body in their car trunk.Elsewhere, Henry and his children have little to show for their scavenging efforts and when their station wagon breaks down after acquiring a parachute from a nearby sky-diving school, Henry appears too tired and discouraged to continue. His bored children, who have thus far been uncooperative, inspire their father to continue, and the family becomes motivated to finally work as team.

She rents a room in a Victorian home owned by the Engels family overlooking the ocean. Another student, Peter Ranson (John Widelock), also rents a room at the same time. As Mason Engels (Brad Reardon) shows Scotty her new accommodation and tells her the house rules, he reveals that the room once belonged to his sister, Victoria (Barbara Steele). Soon, Scotty knocks on Mason's door and asks if she can store her suitcases in the attic. Mason directs her upstairs, but asks her not to disturb his mother, Mrs. Engels, in her room, located near the attic staircase. As Scotty leaves the attic, her landlord looks at her disapprovingly, and stares without uttering a word.Soon, another student-tenant named Jack Towne (Steven Doubet) arrives, and is told by boarder, Doris Pritchard, that Peter is buying the roommates dinner. Later, at the restaurant on the beach, the group becomes acquainted over drinks. As they walk back along the water, Doris is determined to keep drunken Peter at arm's length, while Jack walks Scotty to her room and kisses her. When the tide comes in, Doris takes off her shoes and scampers ahead, but Peter lingers behind on the beach, and she doubles back. Only seeing his jacket, she starts to panic when he sneaks up on her. Angrily, she runs away, and Peter passes out in the sand. The tide awakens him the next morning, and an unknown killer stabs him to death. Later, a jogger and her dog find Peter's body buried in the sand.As Sgt. Manny Rusin (Avery Schreiber) observes Peter's autopsy, he tells his partner, Lt. Sandy McGiver (Cameron Mitchell), that they found nine stab entry wounds on the body. Later, Manny interrogates Doris about the previous night. When Doris is upset by Manny's questions, Scotty chimes in that Peter was drunk and rude, which was the reason Doris left him. Meanwhile, Sandy interrogates Mason, who did not see the tenants return, so Sandy finishes his questioning and leaves with Manny.After Mason tells his mother the police are gone, he returns to his room and locks the door. He opens his father's army footlocker and talks to the man's photograph, complaining about the pain the murder has brought, and how his mother is oblivious to his feelings.On campus, Jack convinces Scotty to take a swim with him on the beach near the house. After their swim, Scotty becomes uneasy and they leave.At the police station, Sandy tells the police chief that there is no weapon or witnesses to Peter's murder. The chief asks Sandy to find concrete evidence that he can tell Peter's parents. On the way back to the house, Scotty confesses that she is attracted to Jack, and they kiss. Back at the station, the officers discover that Mason's sister, Victoria Engels, attacked her former boyfriend and his new girl friend with a knife at a party in the 1960s. They decide to search for Victoria. Scotty goes to the basement, and finds Doris doing laundry. Doris admits to feeling unsettled since the murder. She would like to talk more with Scotty, but Scotty goes upstairs to finish her homework. Jack surprises Scotty in her room, and they make love.Meanwhile, Doris hears the sounds of Scotty and Jack's passion traveling through the ducts. While she listens, an anonymous killer repeatedly stabs her to death. Upstairs, Scotty kicks Jack out of bed on the pretext that she has schoolwork. In a secret bedroom located in the attic, Victoria admires a black and white photograph of her younger self. At one end of the room, she has propped Doris' corpse in a chair and applied heavy makeup to her face. Victoria peers into Doris' lifeless eyes and motions her to be quiet. Next, Victoria looks through the keyhole, and sees her mother asleep in a chair near her door.Later, Scotty goes to the basement, and looks for Doris. She discovers a hidden set of stairs and searches the passageway. At a doorway, she examines a bed sheet stained with blood, and Victoria grabs her. As Scotty wrestles free, Mrs. Engels wakes up and tries to separate them. Mason hears the commotion and runs to the attic. After Jack removes his earphones, he, too, hears noise, and heads to the attic after seeing Scotty is not in her room. Jack tries Victoria's door, but Mrs. Engels and Mason have barricaded it and clamped Scotty's mouth shut. Jack leaves to search for Scotty and Doris.Upstairs, Mason ties up Scotty in Victoria's closet, and complains that his mother has ruined his life. All she cares about is protecting Victoria. Mrs. Engels tells him that Victoria was pregnant with Mason when she tried to hang herself long ago. Both she and the baby survived, and Mrs. Engels brought her home instead of committing her to a mental institution. Although she told Mason that his father was a military officer, the man Mason believes is his father is really his grandfather. Mason refuses to believe the truth and locks himself in his room. When Jack asks about Scotty, Mason knocks him unconscious. Mason opens his grandfather's footlocker and takes out his gun.At the police station, Manny reports that Victoria was institutionalized for three years after her suicide attempt, which followed the knife incident at the party. Although Victoria was lobotomized for her increasingly violent behavior, she left the hospital fifteen years earlier with her mother. The officers then race over to the Engels residence.Meanwhile, Mason is dressed in his grandfather's army uniform, and has loaded the pistol. He returns to Victoria's room, and says there is only one way they can all escape. Mrs. Engels struggles to free the gun from Mason, but she is shot and killed. As Mason strokes Mrs. Engels' body, Victoria pulls a large knife from her mattress and approaches Scotty. However, Victoria changes her mind and heads toward Mason with his back turned. Scotty warns Mason by making guttural sounds through her gag, and he shoots Victoria. Then, Mason turns the gun on himself. Scotty breaks free from one of her restraints just in time to slam the closet door before Victoria attacks her. Jack hears the door slam and finds Victoria. Meanwhile, the police arrive at the house.Before Victoria can decide whom to attack first, Scotty pushes Victoria into the wall, and the knife impales her. The police hear the noise and rush to the attic. There, they see the dead bodies of Mrs. Engels, Mason, and Victoria. A trail of blood leads them to Jack, comforting a tearful Scotty."

City on Fire,1979,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078976/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A pyromaniac, ex-employee of a city oil refinery creates an explosion at the facility which starts a chain-reaction of fires that engulf the entire city. William Dudley is a corrupt mayor of a nameless Midwestern U.S. city who has allowed a chemical refinery to be built right in the center of town, far from any river, lake or reservoir. On one typical hot summer day, Herman Stover, a dangerously disturbed employee at the works has been denied an expected promotion and in addition, finds himself fired. He then decides to take his revenge against the works by opening the valves to the storage vats and their interconnecting pipes, flooding the area and sewers with gasoline and chemicals. It doesn't take long for this act of petty vandalism to start a fire, which starts a chain reaction that causes massive explosions at the refinery, destroying it and spreading a mushroom-cloud of flame that soon engulfs the entire metropolis! The drama focuses on a newly built hospital which, like the refinery and all civic buildings that went up during the mayor's crooked administration, is shoddily built and poorly equipped where the head doctor, Frank Whitman, and his staff treat thousands of casualties from the city-fire while the city fire chief Risley keeps in constant contact with the fire companies fighting a losing battle against the fires, and Maggie Grayson, an alcoholic reporter/newscaster, sees it as her chance to make it nationwide with her coverage of the story of the 'city on fire.'—Alfred Jingle In a present-day nameless American city, Dr. Frank Whitman (Barry Newman) arrives for work as chief surgeon at Brockhurst Hospital, a newly constructed facility downtown. Although the hospital is open for business, head nurse Andrea Harper (Shelley Winters) complains about a generator that is not fully operational.Meanwhile, a twice-widowed and wealthy heiress named Diana Brockhurst-Lautrec (Susan Clark), whose $3 million dollar endowment made the hospital possible, arrives in town for the dedication ceremony. In her hotel suite, Diana greets Mayor William Dudley (Leslie Nielsen), who is eager to resume his extramarital affair with her, while she appears ambivalent. From a rooftop across the street, freelance celebrity photographer Terry James (Terry Haig) takes a snapshot of the mayor kissing Diana.At the studios of CFTM-Channel 10 television, alcoholic host Maggie Grayson (Ava Gardner) reports on the top news stories, including coverage of the hospital dedication.Elsewhere in the city, Herman Stover (Jonathan Welsh) arrives for work at the Manson Refinery, the ninth largest oil refinery in the world, where he has worked for the last 12 years since it's opening. That morning, he hopes for promotion to foreman, but instead the supervisor Mr. Clark (Earl Pennington) offers him a position in Research and Development. Upset, Stover angrily declines the transfer and Mr. Clark rudely lays Stover off.While cleaning out his locker, Stover admires an old newspaper clipping he saved about Diana Brockhurst-Lautrec, who has become an obsession for him. Although he does not know Diana, Stover brags to an uninterested co-worker that he and Diana grew up in the same poor neighborhood and attended Sycamore High, before she married a wealthy, older man. Tired of being ignored, Stover decides to get the attention of Diana and everyone else by sabotaging the refinery. He quickly runs through the plant, adjusting dials and levers. Soon, the operators in the control room notice unusual smoke patterns from the stacks and an increase in the pressure gauges. As alarms sound, Stover continues to inflict damage by opening fuel pipes.Before the dedication ceremony, Dr. Whitman takes a moment to reunite with Diana, a former lover with whom he still has a rapport, and then complains to Mayor Dudley, blaming city politics for the unfinished hospital construction.Leaving the refinery, Herman Stover changes into a new suit and appears at the outdoor dedication in time for Diana's speech. Meanwhile, engineers stabilize the refinery, but the fuel leakage remains undetected and pours into the city's sewer system. When two welders begin work inside a disposal area, their torches ignite a fire, engulfing them in flames. The blaze quickly spreads through the sewer and causes a chain of explosions that completely destroy the refinery and all the workers in it. The massive blasts are felt as violent tremors throughout the city, collapsing buildings and triggering additional fires.Taking charge, Dr. Whitman instructs the crowd at the ceremony to help move the injured into the hospital and implements an emergency plan for the facility. Unable to reach the mayor, Fire Chief Risley (Henry Fonda) assumes command and issues orders to mobilize the National Guard and tanker planes.Trapped at the hospital with no working telephone and an ailing colleague, Mayor Dudley, who has ambitions to be governor, worries about the political fallout from the crisis since he supported the refinery despite public protests about its dangerous proximity to the city.As burn victims crowd the corridors, Dr. Whitman instructs Nurse Harper to clear out non-essential personnel to make room for incoming wounded. Meanwhile, Diana does her best to assist the medical staff, while Stover remains near and also volunteers, hoping that Diana will notice him.From the television studio, Maggie reports that the casualties number over 3,000, water pressure is falling due to the lingering summer-long drought and looting has begun. The photographer, Terry James, is badly injured after retrieving the pictures of Diana and the mayor from his burning darkroom. As Terry is loaded into an ambulance, the envelope of photos remains tucked underneath his shirt and later falls into Stover's hands after Terry dies at Brockhurst Hospital.At Fire Headquarters, while updating a councilman (Cec Linder) about the nearly 200 fires burning across the city, Risley emphasizes that the people at Brockhurst are at risk of suffocating from the firestorm, which will siphon oxygen from the air. Risley's office contacts the television news crew on the roof to set up a broadcast signal with the mayor, who confirms that breathing is becoming more difficult. Then, a series of explosions occur, destroying a supply truck and making the street leading to the hospital impassable for rescue vehicles.Since the fast and changing winds prevent the use of helicopters, Risley devises a plan for firefighters to create a ""water tunnel"" outside the facility. However, the hospital's fire hoses must cover the first 100 yards from the doors. As people leave the hospital, the mayor soaks everyone with water, including those on stretchers, so that they will have some protection from the uncontrollable flames in the streets until they reach the firemen's tunnel. Tirelessly, Dr. Whitman directs the medical staff and patients towards the exit while continuing to treat the injured.In another area of the hospital, Diana assists Mrs. Adams, who is about to give birth. During the delivery, Stover approaches Diana to discuss the incriminating photographs, and she promptly dismisses him. As the final group of evacuees gather at the door, Dr. Whitman finds Diana with Mrs. Adams and her newborn baby and prepares them for evacuation. Feeling rejected amid all his efforts, Stover walks out in a daze and is killed when a scaffolding collapses. Nurse Harper tries to save him, but is also struck down and killed by burning debris. As the last person to leave the hospital, Dr. Whitman must roll in puddles to keep his clothing wet when the water from the hose runs out, and he is nearly trapped by flames on the street, but Mayor Dudley guides him toward an opening before the hospital explodes.Later a day or so later, at the rescue camp in a quarry outside the destroyed city, Mayor Dudley's reputation is restored when Maggie calls him a ""hero"" on television, though the Mayor insists that the townspeople themselves are the real heroes. Nearby, Diana and Dr. Whitman kiss and renew their relationship.In the final scene, Chief Risley, as he leaves headquarters, declares to the staff that it takes one person to set fire and destroy an entire city."

The Lady in Red,1979,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0079429/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A naive farm girl's life turns upside down after being in the wrong place at the wrong time. She moves to Chicago and becomes trapped in a vicious cycle of prostitution and crime. Polly, a young countryside girl decides to leave for the city and all it has to offer. She starts an relationship with John Dillinger and soon discovers that city life isn't as easy as she hoped when she gets entangled in a world of crime and prostitution. The movie is partly based on the life of John Dillinger.—Fauno Pamela Sue Martin kicked off the goody two shoes from her Nancy Drew image to play the feisty farm girl with Hollywood dreams who walked out of the Biograph on the arm of John Dillinger the night he was killed by the FBI. John Sayles wrote this depression-era gangster drama, loosely based on the real story of Polly Hamilton (renamed Polly Franklin for the film), and stuffs plenty of sex and social commentary around a surprisingly faithful recounting of the real-life event. Martin transforms from naive young thing to brassy hustler without losing her sweetness, and Robert Conrad is quite the gentleman hoodlum as Dillinger, but the unsung hero of the piece is Robert Forster, uncredited but indelible as a hit man who falls for fallen woman Polly. Colorful, action packed, and full of underdog spunk, this is exploitation movie-making with a populist sensibility."

Woyzeck,1979,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080149/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Franz Woyzeck is a hapless, hopeless soldier, alone and powerless in society, assaulted from all sides by forces he can not control. Everything in town appears calm, placid, lovely. But Woyzeck, a rifleman assigned as an orderly, hears voices -- the times are out of joint, at least in his cosmos. To his captain, Woyzeck is a comic marvel: ignorant but courageous, full of energy to little purpose. To a local doctor, Woyzeck is a curiosity, the object of cruel study. Woyzeck, 40, has a young wife, Marie, and a small child. He dotes on them, but Marie, even though she has periods of guilt and remorse, carries on affairs and flirtations. When the captain lets drop broad hints of Woyzeck's being a cuckold, his inner demons and the voices of the spheres take over. Will madness bring action? Of what sort?—<jhailey@hotmail.com> Franz Woyzeck is a hapless, hopeless soldier, alone and powerless in society, assaulted from all sides by forces he cannot control. Abused and tortured, both physically and psychologically by commanding officers, doctors and his unfaithful wife, Marie, Woyzeck struggles to hold on to his humanity and his fragile sanity.—Mattias Oldenborg The story of Woyzeck begins ""in a small town, on a large, still pond."" We are then introduced to Franz Woyzeck (Klaus Kinski) as he is performing a military drill in full uniform-running, pushups, etc. Immediately after, he is seen giving the Captain a shave (Wolfgang Reichmann). The Captain is thinking aloud to Woyzeck about what characterizes a ""good person."" He first comments that Woyzeck works too quickly, then criticizes Woyzeck for having a child without the church's blessing. Woyzeck defends himself by quoting Matthew 19:14 from The Bible. The Captain says then that he was referring to Woyzeck, not to his son. Woyzeck claims that poor people have no use for morals, and that their kind suffers in both this world and the next. ""Even if poor people were to get into heaven, they would have to work the thunder."" The Captain responds by telling Woyzeck that he has no virtue. Woyzeck explains that poor people have no virtue, and do only what comes naturally to them. The Captain complains about Woyzeck thinking too much and comments that he has a ""hunted"" disposition. He then explains that a good person does not behave as though he is being hunted. A good person is one of virtue. As the Captain stands to leave, he tells Woyzeck that he is a good person, but always seems so hunted. He dismisses him, telling him to go slowly. Woyzeck, however, leaves in a rush as usual.Next, we see him under a tree with his fellow soldier and friend, Andres (Paul Burian). The two are whittling sticks for the Captain as Woyzeck hears a noise. After looking around, he grabs Andres by the hand and the two crouch behind the tree branches. Andres asks Wozyeck if he can still hear the sound, and Woyzeck replies, ""Still. Everything is still...as if the world were dead.""In the next scene, Woyzeck's mistress, Marie (Eva Mattes), is watching a parade on the street below from her apartment window. As she stands there with her friend Margret (Irm Hermann) and her son, the band on the street approaches and the two women take notice of the attractive Drum Major (Josef Bierbichler). As the band passes their building, the Drum Major makes eye-contact with Marie and begins singing in an operatic style. Margret and Marie begin to discuss ""what a man"" he is-with the ""paws of a lion."" Margret comments about how the two noticed each other, saying that Marie looks at him as she looks at no other man, with glistening eyes. Marie becomes offended, and tells Margret that she should take her eyes to the Jew to have them polished, so they would glisten as well. Margret claims to be an honorable person, and claims that Marie ""looks through leather pants."" Moments later, Franz enters, carrying the sticks he was whittling, and Marie notices that he seems disturbed. She asks him if he was out collecting wood for the Captain again, and He explains to Marie that ""it"" was there again and it followed him. He tells her he cannot stay long because he must go to mass that evening. After he leaves, Marie comments that he seems absent, and Margret notices that he did not even acknowledge his son. Marie says that she believes his thoughts could drive him crazy. She then asks her son why he is so quiet, and if he is scared.Franz is then seen at the Doctor's (Willy Semmelrogge) office. The Doctor scolds Woyzeck for urinating on the wall outside ""like a dog."" Woyzeck explains that he was only answering the call of nature, but the Doctor tells him that mankind is free, and he has therefore committed an act of betrayal. The Doctor asks Woyzeck if he has been consistent in his peas-only diet. He tells him that they will add mutton to his diet the following week. The Doctor exclaims that they will revolutionize science, and asks Woyzeck for a urine sample. Woyzeck is unable to urinate, and begins telling of his apocalyptic visions to the Doctor. He says that a ""frightful voice"" spoke to him. He then says that the world will be completely dark when ""nature is over."" The Doctor comments on his beautiful fixed idea, and gives him a raise of an extra dime for the next week. Woyzeck stands, staring blankly into space.Next, we see Franz in his formal blue uniform with Marie and their son at the carnival. The two walk around, looking at the various attractions, Franz holding their son. The Drum Major is also their with a Lower Officer (Herbert Fux). Marie notices them as they stop near a man playing an organ grinder. She half-smiles at them, but says nothing to them or to Franz. They follow Woyzeck and his family into a show featuring a teachable horse. The man hosting the show draws their attention with a small monkey dressed as a soldier, claiming that he is the ""lowest rank of soldier."" He then invites them to see the horse, and the Drum Major and Lower Officer have a brief conversation about how attractive Marie is, saying that she is ideal for breeding young drum majors, as they follow her and Franz into the tent. The host presents an ""astronomical horse"" that can put any educated human to shame, and asks the horse a few questions. He asks first if there is a jackass present. The horse nods. He then asks the horse what 2x2 is, and the horse taps its hoof four times. Lastly, he says that the horse will tell the time, and asks the group for a watch so that he may verify the horse's guess. The Lower Officer offers his watch, and Marie asks to see it. He tells her that he is not going to give it to her, and she gets up to go to him. The Drum Major picks her up as she is walking over the benches, and lowers her down next to him, telling those around them, ""This is a woman."" Marie gazes into his eyes, giggling, and the next scene shows them alone in Marie's kitchen. Marie has him march around, and compliments his ""bull-like chest"" and ""lion-like paws."" She claims he is the epitome of manliness, and he tells her that she should see him on Sunday at the dance with his plume and gloves. He then begins touching her breasts while remarking what an amazing woman she is, and that they should make a brood of young drum majors together. She tells him to stop at first, but does not resist as he attempts to undress her a second time.There is an abrupt transition to the next scene in which Woyzeck is helping the Doctor with an experiment. The Doctor is attempting to demonstrate to a group of students how a cat reacts on instinct when dropped from a high window. The Doctor is lecturing a group of students on the street from a second story window, while Woyzeck is inattentively standing off to the left side of the screen. He commands Woyzeck to stand directly below the window as he throws the cat, and Woyzeck catches the cat. The cat deficates on Woyzeck, and he begins shaking uncontrollably. The Doctor has Woyzeck sit on a bench, and invites the students to feel his pulse and observe the various results of the pea-experiment as he explains the experiment to them. They notice his irregular pulse, and the Doctor tells him to wiggle his ears to demonstrate that he uses different muscle groups to do so. Woyzeck tells the doctor he is fainting, and the Doctor becomes upset. He explains to the audience that this is part of the ""transformation to a donkey,"" and notices his hair loss.The story shifts back to Marie, who is sitting in front of her mirror with her son, admiring the shiny earrings the Drum Major gave her. She puts the boy to bed and sings him a lullaby before returning to the mirror to admire her earrings once more, saying how nice they will be for the dance. As she sits there, she compares her life to the lives of wealthier women. The boy wakes up, and Marie puts him back to sleep. Franz enters quietly and startles Marie as she is bent over the child's bed. She immediately covers her earrings, and Franz asks about them. Marie claims to have found them, and defends herself by saying that she is ""only human."" Franz tells her it is okay, gives her his pay for the day, and leaves. Marie says ""God bless you"" to him, and is left crying, claiming that she is a bad person and saying that she could stab herself.In the following scene, The Captain is walking down the sidewalk. The Doctor rushes past, and the Captain tries to stop him. The Doctor claims to be in a hurry, but the Captain tells him that good people are never in a hurry. Once the Doctor stops, the Captain explains that he feels melancholy. The Doctor observes the Captain is bloated and fat with a thick neck. He concludes that he has suffered a stroke, is already half-paralyzed, and will be a vegetable within four weeks. He will, however, make a fine subject for medical research. The Captain tells the Doctor to stop scaring him, and begins to imagine the sight of his own funeral. Just then, Woyzeck walks by, and the Captain invites him to stay and converse. He says that Woyzeck runs through life like a razor, and should be careful, lest he cut somebody. He asks Woyzeck if he has found any hair in his soup recently...particularly the hair of a drum major. Woyzeck turns pale and the Doctor begins making observations about his irregular pulse, angry facial expressions, and body tension. Woyzeck begins rambling about how cold hell is. He comments on the nice weather, saying that the sky is solid and gray. He says that it is so solid, one could drive a peg into it and hang himself from it. He finally leaves in a hurry, and the Doctor follows. The Captain is left saying that he does not like the fact that people confuse him. He says that a good man pays attention, loves his life, and has no courage. He says that he only joined the military to affirm his love of life, then walks away, laughing.When Woyzeck arrives at home, Marie is scrubbing the floor. As Franz approaches her, she freezes, and he picks her up slowly by the arm. As she stands, he looks at her, and says, ""Ah, it's still you."" She tells him that he is scaring her, and he begins to question her about the Drum Major. Franz asks how he touched her and where he stood. as he is doing so, he immitates the Drum Major's actions, standing closely to Marie, and groping her. He then places his head on Marie's shoulder and tells her that he wishes he were the Drum Major. The two begin to argue, and Franz raises his arm to hit Marie. She tells him she would rather have a knife in her body than be touched by his hand. Franz walks away from Marie, saying that there should be a sign on her.Franz then goes to talk with Andres. He sits nervously on a stool in an office as Andres is writing in a book. Woyzeck goes to the window, and tells Andres that they are dancing. Andres casually tells him that they are at The White Horse, and Woyzeck decides to go to Marie while she is at the dance. He arrives to find Marie dancing with the Drum Major and saying ""Don't stop, don't stop."" Franz thinks aloud outside, saying that they fornicate before his eyes like flies on his hand. He quickly runs away as a drunk sitting next to him wakes up. The man stands and delivers a soliloquy about a man thinking about the purpose of life. He says that everyone has been created by God. He says that soldiers were created to kill their own kind, and therefore, everything of the earth is evil. He ends by saying, ""Let us piss a cross, so that a Jew dies."" We then see Woyzeck running through a field, saying to himself ""Don't stop, don't stop."" He throws himself on the ground, listening to the earth, which is telling him to ""stab dead."" He slowly stands, thinking about it. He runs away, again reciting, ""Don't stop, don't stop.In the next scene, Woyzeck is seated in a bar, with the Drum Major sitting behind him. The Drum Major begins bragging about how much of a man he is. He addresses Woyzeck, threatening to knock his nose into his ass. He approaches Woyzeck, insisting that he drink, because a man must drink. He grabs Woyzeck by the face, and attempts to pour the drink into his mouth. Woyzeck refuses and hits the Drum Major on the cheek. The Drum Major grabs Woyzeck, and squeezes the air out of Woyzeck before releasing him. He pats Woyzeck on the head, and sits back down. Woyzeck leaves the bar saying ""One thing at a time.""Woyzeck lies awake that night in the barracks, hallucinating. He hears voices in his head saying, ""Don't stop, don't stop!"" and ""Stab, stab!"" He awakens Andres, asking if he can hear it. Andres tells him to let them dance, and goes back to sleep. Franz says that he has a pain between his eyes like a knife, and Andres tells him to go back to sleep. Franz lies awake, shaking. Marie also sits awake in her kitchen reading from John 8 in the Bible. She reads the passage in which Jesus forgives the prostitute of her sins, and asks the Lord to not look at her. She comments that Franz did not come home that night or the night before.The next day, Woyzeck asks Andres if he had heard the voices the night before. After Andres says no, Woyzeck says that ""She was a special girl,"" and hurries away and purchases a knife from a Jewish merchant. The merchant tells him that the knife is in good condition and straight. He brags that it is cheap, and would bring an ""economic death."" Woyzeck then returns to the barracks and gives his belongings away to Andres. He empties out a chest near his bed, giving him a ring, a crucifix, and other religious relics. Franz sits on the chest, and reads his birth certificate aloud. Andres remarks that Woyzeck does not look well, and should go to the infirmary. The scene then transitions to Marie, who sits, and tells a story to a group of children. She tells of a child who was completely alone in the world. The child went to the moon, but found it to be a piece of rotted wood. Then, the child went to the sun, which was only a wilted sunflower. The child then went to the stars, but found that they were only small golden bugs. Finally, the child returned to the earth, but found that it was only an overturned cauldron. The child sat, and began to cry. At the end of the story, Franz approaches Marie, and tells her it is time to go.The two walk down to the pond, and Marie tells Franz she wants to go home. Franz asks Marie how long they have been together, and how long she thinks their relationship will last. He then remarks that she has the breath of a whore. Marie notices how red the moon is, and also that Franz seems to be up to something. At that moment, he pulls out the knife and stabs her. She screams, and he stares into her eyes. Once she is on the ground, he continues to stab her. Franz sits, staring at her and weeping, and then panics and runs back toward the town. He runs into a bar, where he sits and talks with a woman. She sits on his lap, and he notices that she is also hot, like Marie. He tells her that she, too, will be cold in the end. Franz asks the woman to sing, and she notices the blood on his sleeve, and draws attention to it. Woyzeck claims that he cut himself, and wiped it off. The bartender notices that it covers his arm up to the elbow.Woyzeck runs away, and returns to the pond. Wanting to hide the evidence, he searches frantically for the knife. He pauses, and bends over Marie, touching her hair. He then finds the knife, and throws it into the water. Thinking it will be too easy to find, he goes into the stream to throw it into deeper water, and notices stains on his clothing. He goes even deeper into the water, trying to wash the blood off. The scene then shifts to the next day. Officials are investigating the scene of Marie's death. The film ends here, as the original was left unfinished at Georg Büchner's death."

All three of which are better made but Island Of The Fishmen is entertaining as well.Like all Sci-Fi, it's a dramatic fantasy contemplating where current technological discoveries may bring us. Like all dated Sci-Fi, this movie's quaint as the current technology of which it's based has now been far surpassed.A prison ship is wrecked, several crew members along with several prisoners make it to shore on an unchartered island only to meet violent ends due to the perils on the island. All except the ships doctor and his mate who discover an insane recluse doctor, his beautiful daughter (Bond Girl, Barbara Bach, a group of voodoo tribes people who serve the bad guy, the final inhabitant that intends on scavenging the riches of Atlantis, 2,000 feet underwater and will stop at nothing to do so.The recluse doctor has been using the protection of the island to perform biological experiments, creating the perfect cross of human and fish whom can survive any world catastrophy. He does this with a white fluid which turns ordinary men into fishmen and since his daughter is the one who keeps the fishmen fed with this fluid, they love and protect her, unfortunatly for anyone that threatens her.The bad guy is using the fishmen to collect the riches of underwater Atlantis, while we get some lame dramas of mad scientist turns people into gilled ubermenschen, voodoo rituals, bad guy wants beautiful daughter but his rough advances are spurned, prisoner wants beautiful daughter but his even rougher advances are abrutly ended by her protective fishmen, volcano erupts, ships doctor gets the girl, and are saved from eruptong volcano by fishmen.There's excellent footage of real flowing lava, the underwater sounds are cool, and Barbara Bach has never been more alluring in long cotton skirts, damp hair laying heavy off her head, gemstone eyes and ""the way she moves"" about her."

Famous drag racer Lonnie 'Lucky Man' Johnson drives a funny car and is the star driver of his sponsor Fast Company, managed by the corrupt Phil Adamson. He also becomes a mentor to the promising racer Billy 'The Kid' Crocker. When Adamson makes a deal with Lonnie's competitor, Gary 'The Blacksmith' Black, he steals the funny car from Lonnie and Billy. When they find out, they take back the car with plans to run it independently in the next race. This infuriates Adamson, who aims to put a clamp on his former star's plans by any means necessary.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil At a racetrack, aging drag racing star Lonnie ""Lucky Man"" Johnson (William Smith) makes engine refinements to his car, which is sponsored by the international oil company Fast Co. On its first test run around a track, it blows up, but Lonnie escapes unhurt, living up to his nickname. Fast Co team boss Phil Adamson (John Saxon) is not impressed, telling the head mechanic, Elder (Don Francks), that the team can't afford to win if it breaks the budget. The real business is that the car remains competitive and helps sell Fast Co products. In the Funny Car class, Lonnie's protégé Billy ""The Kid"" Brooker (Nicholas Campbell) gives top dog Gary ""The Blacksmith"" Black (Cedric Smith) a close run.On the road to Big Sky, Montana, Lonnie calls his girlfriend Sammy (Claudia Jennings), who is living in Seattle, saying he misses her.

At the meet, Lonnie is less then complimentary on his Fast Co TV spot. Adamson is incensed and calls the company to say he's bringing in Gary Black.

Escape to Athena,1979,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0079117/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A World War II adventure involving a group of Allied P.O.W.s, Nazis, black market priceless art treasures, Greek resistance, a Greek monastery, and a secret German rocket base. During World War II, the prisoners of a German camp on a Greek island are trying to escape. They don't want only their freedom, but they also seek an ineffable treasure hidden in a monastery at the top of the island's mountain.—Chris Makrozahopoulos <makzax@hotmail.com> The ever efficient German war machine had little trouble sweeping over Greece, yet some stubborn resistance remained active. Various civilian prisoners were thrown with the officers in Stalag VII-Z, a camp on the site of a Neptune temple under two masters: S.S. Major Volkmann (Anthony Valentine), a Nazi extremist who enjoys exercising brutality, and gentleman camp commandant, former dodgy Viennese art merchant Major Otto Hecht (Roger Moore), who definitely prefers the finer things in life, regardless of ""political correctness"". Thus, the camp, meant to send Berlin archaeological treasures, actually keeps the true treasures for his private black market trade, via Hecht's sister in Switzerland. His ""guests"", all fortunate to be spared the usual harsh treatment of prisoners, include a brilliant professor of archaeology, Professor Blake (David Niven); an Italian cook, Bruno Rotelli (Sonny Bono); two stranded American USO performers Charlie (Elliott Gould) and Dottie Del Mar (Stefanie Powers); and even an African-American POW, Nat Judson (Richard Roundtree). Hecht's hospitality seems poorly rewarded when they mount an elaborate plan to take over the camp, in league with the local Greek resistance leader Zeno (Telly Savalas), who is determined to prevent the inevitable German slaughter of villagers in reprisal. As all seem to agree upon a common goal, the priceless art treasures in the monastery on nearby Mount Athena, Hecht is persuaded to join in for a cut of the spoils, but Zeno has a military agenda, as the Allied invasion is approaching and the monastery's mountain is also the cover for a secret German rocket installation.—KGF Vissers"

They had supported themselves by hunting seals, but now that the last of the aquatic mammals has been killed off, they seek shelter in the apartment of Essex's brother, a renowned Quintet player.

Many other species are capable of killing their prey by use of electric shocks, acids or poisons. Of the millions of planets capable of supporting life in the universe, it is a certainty that hundreds of thousands have developed species of life with characteristics similar, and possibly more dangerous, than those found on our own planet earth. It is also a certainty that not all alien encounters will be friendly!""One night, a young woman, Shelly Warner (Kathy Richards), is attacked and beheaded by an unseen and super strong being while walking down a dark sidewalk in Santa Monica, California. Meanwhile, at a yacht party, aspiring actor Randy Morse (Jeffery Reese) approaches a psychic named De Renzey (Jacquelyn Hyde), who foresees a deadly incident in his future, but does not alert the young man.The next day, Roy Warner (William Devane), an author who writes under the alias Steve Dupree, is informed of his daughter's murder. When Roy arrives at the morgue to identity the body, Detective Dave Mooney (Richard Jaekel), the officer in charge of Shelly's case, recognizes him. Mooney tells his partner, Detective Jack Bresler (Biff Elliot), that Roy was released from prison three years ago after serving time for murdering his wife's lover; Mooney was the officer who arrested him.Meanwhile, KFVI television newscaster, Zoe Owens (Cathy Lee Crosby), who is tired of reporting on fashion, convinces her boss, Sherman Moss (Keenan Wynn), to assign her Shelly's murder. On the evening news, she relates the unusual brutality of the crime while also mentioning that the victim's father is an ex-convict and a successful author of crime fiction. De Renzey watches the broadcast with apprehension, sensing that the killer will strike again soon.That night at an ice company, employee Henry Lydell (Vernon Washington) arrives for his evening rounds. When the lights flicker, he enters the basement to investigate and encounters a large mutant creature, whose eyes become laser weapons that incinerate Henry.Meanwhile, at a bar, Mooney meets with Roy to discuss the case, and Roy voices his skepticism of police competence. Roy declares that he will be watching closely to make sure the detective is pursuing every lead, but Mooney warns him not to interfere. Later, Mooney and Bresler investigate the ice company crime scene and find no evidence, except for another mutilated body. As they leave, a crowd of irate citizens demands better security from the police. After installing a police scanner in his car, Roy hears reports of a second slaying, but Mooney refuses to share details.At police headquarters the next morning, De Renzey informs Mooney and Bresler about the young actor she met on a yacht, whom she believes will cross paths with the killer. However, without a name or other substantial details, the detectives dismiss the psychic lead. Meanwhile, reports of a ""mangler"" on the loose dominate newspaper headlines. Based on evidence found underneath Shelly's fingernails, the pathologist (Casey Kasem) reveals that the killer has gray skin and no blood vessels, prompting one officer to joke that they are looking for a zombie. Captain Speer (Warren Kemmerling) warns his staff to keep this information out of the media so the public will not panic, then pressures Mooney to find a lead.Later, at a restaurant, Roy invites Zoe to his table and tries to obtain additional details on the case. Although, she is intrigued by Roy's roguish charm, Zoe declares that the police are in charge and walks away. That night, a man leaving a bar becomes the third victim when the large creature-zombie attacks him in an alley and rips his head off. At the same time, De Renzey senses that the beastly creature has struck again.In front of police headquarters, a group of demonstrators gather to protest law enforcement's lack of progress. Zoe interviews a man who claims the police are more interested in harassing innocent citizens than keeping the streets safe from a mangler. Later, Zoe accepts Roy's invitation for a drink. With skepticism, she tells him that a psychic named De Renzey confronted her that morning about a potential victim, an unknown actor, who will lead them to the killer if Zoe can track him down. Although Roy is intrigued by the possibilities of the occult, he is more interested in seducing Zoe.That night at her home, De Renzey receives a hurricane-like premonition of evil that disables her and smashes the furniture. Meanwhile, at the airport, the bloodless creature (John Bloom) kills a fourth victim, a flight attendant returning to her car, which the creature incinerates with its laser eyes. Arriving on the scene, Mooney and Bresler are frustrated by the lack of any discernible pattern to the murders other than their nightly occurrence.The next morning, Roy tracks down De Renzey at home in bed, recovering from a stroke. She warns him that the alien killer must be stopped that night or the creature will be nearly invincible, as it grows stronger with each murder. With Zoe's help, Roy searches the city to find the unknown actor from the yacht. They inquire at various nightclubs without any luck, until a young woman, Camille, overhears their conversation at a bar. She says that her boyfriend, Randy, was recently bragging about attending a fancy yacht party and is currently in the parking lot intoxicated and fumbling for his car keys. When Zoe and Roy run outside, Randy speeds away, and a car chase ensues, ending with Randy crashing into an old monastery and running away. When Roy and Zoe look for Randy, they encounter the alien creature as it throws Randy's dead body through a brick wall.Meanwhile, Mooney, who was following Roy's car, arrives on the scene and requests backup as soon as he realizes the mangler is on the premises. Zoe and Roy are able to evade the alien until police arrive and barrage the creature with gunfire. However, the alien uses his laser eyes and super-human strength to kill many of the officers, including Bresler. When Zoe is threatened, Roy fends off the creature with a torch and then sets it on fire, which causes the alien to explode and disappear without a trace.Afterward, Roy and Zoe contemplate Earth's first encounter with a being from another planet. The voice-over narrator explains that man has its first encounter with an alien form of life. A mysterious blind man (glimpsed throughout the film) is seen walking down a dark street. It is never explained who the blind man is or if he has any connection to the alien."

US Army war veteran Hazel Motes may not be a believing Christian, somehow observations like the state of a run-down country church, meeting the ridiculous frauds on the streets and memories inspire him to take up, after initially fierce refusal, the part of a traveling preacher when a cab driver insists he looks like one in his new hat. He starts his own new Church of Truth, without the crucified Jesus, his first disciple being an 18-year old simpleton with a 'prophetic gift'...—KGF Vissers In this acclaimed adaptation of the first novel by legendary Southern writer Flannery O'Connor, John Huston vividly brings to life her poetic world of American eccentricity. Brad Dourif, in an impassioned performance, is Hazel Motes, who, fresh out of the army, attempts to open the first Church Without Christ in the small town of Taulkinham. Populated with inspired performances that seem to spring right from O'Connor's pages, Huston's Wise Blood is an incisive portrait of spirituality and Evangelicalism, and a faithful, loving evocation of a writer's vision. After being decommissioned from the US Army, strong minded Hazel Motes decides to relocate to the city rather than go back to his small southern town where he no longer has any family, or any semblance of a home, either emotional or physical. In meeting Asa Hawks, a blind sidewalk preacher, and his assistant daughter, Sabbath Lily, Hazel, reacting against Asa's preachings and perhaps in knowing that they are perpetrating a scam, decides to start his own sidewalk church, one that does not believe in God, sin or evil, or that will collect offerings. In doing so, Haze, in turn, garners strong reactions from various people he meets. Asa doesn't like what ""business"" Haze may take away from him, while Lily is attracted to him. Haze obtains a groupie in the form of Enoch Emory, relatively new to the city and without friends, he searching for his place in life and something in which to believe. Another sidewalk preacher, Hoover Shoates, wants to profit off of what Haze has started. And while Haze initially lives with Leora Watts, who operates a ""rooming house"" which is more a single person brothel, he ends up moving into the same rooming house where Asa and Lily live, the landlady who has a motherly attachment to him. Through all these encounters, Haze ultimately demonstrates how strong his devotion is to his beliefs regardless of anyone or anything else.—Huggo"

thinks that Kate is too strong-willed and that the conditioning might
drive her insane, but he goes along with Barker's plan anyway. Mr Hodge [Max Phipps],
also of some hoidy-toidy vampire lineage that is never identified, can't
wait to mate with Kate and unite their blood lines. Only Dr Eric Fraser [David Hemmings]
seems concerned with Kate's welfare and wants to use reason and persuasion
to get her to willingly join them as their Baroness. Kate will have
nothing to do with it, no matter how many times they try to force her to
drink blood. When Barker and Gauss place Kate in the room with only a tiny
hole through which to view the outside world, as it was done to her
ancestor, Dr Fraser makes them release her. Kate attempts to run away, but
she is hunted down and brought back to the farm. It looks like there is no
escape.Tonight is the opening ceremony for The Farm's Festival. Visiting
vampires from around the world will be attending. Kate is invited to
participate but refuses. That night, just after midnight, she is awakened
by the chanting of ""Hyma Perpetui"" (Human Blood Always), the motto of The
Farm. Kate peeks in the chapel door and witnesses an elderly vampire
drinking the blood from the neck of a young bloodcow. Kate's screams
disrupt the service. Barker is not pleased, but Fraser reminds her that
Kate needs time. Against Fraser's advice, however, Barker decides to
proceed with the conditioning. First, Kate is drugged. When she wakes up,
she finds herself on a picnic with Derek. After making love to Derek, Kate
bites into a chicken leg and gets a mouth full of blood. Derek suddenly
turns into Hodges, who thanks her for honoring him. Feeling soiled, Kate
jumps into a nearby river. When she emerges, a rainstorm is hitting. She
seeks shelter and finds herself at the gate of her own house where she is
met by her maid, Lori Dantry [Rosie Sturgess]. Lori assures Kate that she only left the
house an hour ago and escorts her to the shower. Kate strips and enters
the shower stall, but the shower spews out blood. ""The thirst is in all of
us,"" Lori consoles. Kate screams, ""NOT IN ME!""Suddenly, Kate is 5-years old. She is being sent off to boarding
school where she learns that her mother has died. Mrs Barker's voice tells
Kate to ""Cut your ties with the past,"" but Kate goes in search of her
mother, Barker, Lori, anyone. Instead, she finds herself in a room that
seems to be collapsing around her. Only when she picks up a mug of blood
does the destruction stop, but she pours the blood onto the floor.
Suddenly something starts hacking through the door with an axe. Terrified,
Kate finds another mug of blood, but this time she drinks it and the
hacking stops. For the next fourteen days of her programming, she
willfully drinks the blood whenever it is given to her. Everyone is
pleased with Kate's progress except for Dr Fraser. ""Let us hope that,
despite all this, we're still able to earn her respect,"" is his only
comment.It is several days later. Dressed in regal splendor, Kate is
preparing to engage in ceremonial blood-drinking. Urged on by whispers of,
""It's your destiny,"" Kate allows the silver fangs to be placed in her
mouth, a cut to be made in the bloodcow's neck, and she willingly bends
forward and begins drinking the spurting blood. Again, everyone is
impressed, but Mrs Barker wants to make sure that Kate's indoctrination
will hold up in the outside world, so they send her home. The
indoctrination appears to be holding, as Kate willingly drinks from the
neck of her secretary but, when it comes to drinking from Derek, she
balks. Mrs Barker decides that Kate needs more conditioning, but Dr Fraser
refuses to allow it. Before the committee can meet to discuss what to do
about Kate, Fraser decides to help Kate escape. He first releases Derek
from the cell where he is being held. As they attempt to escape from The
Farm, they are seen by Mrs Barker. Derek runs, but Fraser stays to
struggle with Barker. Barker falls into a blood processing vat. While the
workers try to figure out what is blocking the number three tube from the
vat, Fraser goes back to get Kate and they prepare to take off in a
helicopter. Unfortunately, Gauss sees them and grabs the runner of the
helicopter as it takes off. Gauss eventually falls off, lands on a string
of high voltage wires, and is fried to a crisp.Fraser leads Kate to a hut in the woods where he says that Derek is
waiting for her. What she finds, however, is Derek being exsanguinated.
Kate orders Fraser to release Derek. As Kate and Derek embrace, Fraser
puts in a pair of fangs. Kate begs Fraser for a second chance. ""I AM one
of you,"" she says over and over as Fraser drinks her blood. In the
distance, Hodges' voice can be heard thanking Fraser for heading up the
conditioning program that will now make it possible for the two greatest
vampire families to be united forever. [Original Synopsis by bj_kuehl.]"

Nightwing,1979,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0079631/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Killer bats plague an Indian reservation in New Mexico. A colony of vampire bats terrorize a small Indian community in New Mexico. Standard ""Nature goes berserk"" plot takes a twist toward the end when supernatural forces are discovered working through the bats.—B.M. On the Maski Indian reservation in the desert Southwest, tribal deputy Youngman Duran (Nick Mancuso) is summoned to a ranch where a herd of horses has mysteriously died. Examining a mare, Duran is dumbfounded by the plethora of deep bite marks and the strong smell of ammonia around the dead animal. Duran is upset to see Walker Chee (Stephen Macht), a chief from the neighboring Pahana tribe, arrive by helicopter with a veterinarian, since the Pahana do not have jurisdiction in the area. Considering his own tribe's impoverishment, Duran resents the Pahana's affluence, as well as Chee's business schemes. Duran leaves the investigation with Chee, whose veterinarian is also baffled by the horse massacre.Duran then visits Abner Tasupi (George Clutesi), a Maski priest, who has been banished from the community, for witchcraft. Although Duran was raised by Abner and admires him, he reminds the elderly man that Maski leaders fear his magic. Under the influence of the hallucinogenic datura root, Abner declares that he has cast a spell to end the world, whose greed threatens the Maski. Pointing to a circular painting on the floor, Abner says that he has instigated this apocalypse by destroying the outer ring of the picture, thus ""opening the circle."" Furthermore, Abner predicts that he will die that evening and announces Duran will be a powerful warrior. Skeptical, Duran leaves.At sunset, Duran relaxes in a hot spring with his girl friend, Anne Dillon (Kathryn Dillon), an aspiring doctor who runs a clinic on the reservation. He is jealous to learn that Anne has been accepted to medical school and will be moving to Houston, Texas, while he struggles on the reservation.The next morning, Duran finds Abner lying dead next to the floor painting with bite marks on his face and realizes that the old man's rant was not a hallucination. After gathering supplies for the burial, Duran returns to the dwelling and is angry to find a British scientist named Philip Payne (David Warner) taking tissue samples from Abner's corpse. Despite Payne's insistence that he is a specialist who can determine the cause of death, Duran points a gun at the man and orders him to leave.As Duran buries Abner, Anne embarks on a tour of the reservation for several days with four missionaries whom she hopes will contribute funds for new medical clinic. Meanwhile, at the Pahana Tribal Council, Payne meets with Chee to ask for support in tracking vampire bats that have likely migrated to the area from Mexico. However, Chee says he does not have time to facilitate Payne's research. Frustrated, Payne leaves and tells Chee to telephone him if there are sightings of carcasses smelling of ammonia.In the meantime, Chee pursues a lucrative business deal and appeals to Duran regarding a permit to mine shale oil in Maski Canyon. Insulted by the idea, Duran reminds Chee that the area is the holiest site within the Maski religion. Elsewhere, Payne confirms that vampire bats massacred a flock of sheep and alerts Chee. After examining a blood specimen from the carcasses, the scientist demonstrates to the tribal chief and a medical doctor that the bats carry bubonic plague. He also explains that the ammonia smell results from the bats discharging excess blood in order to become airborne again. Payne warns that the colony will eventually be drawn to human populations and spread the plague. Arguing that a quarantine on the reservation will attract inexperienced health officials and lead to panic, Payne convinces Chee that he can track and exterminate the bat colony within three days. In the meantime, Payne provides the doctor with a vaccine that offers some resistance to the plague.Meanwhile, at their campsite in the desert, Anne and the missionaries are attacked during the night by the vampire bats. Anne is the only survivor, but she is stranded after their camper van crashes in the desert during the escape. Elsewhere, at a rain dance ceremony, Duran discovers seven dead Maski priests, who contracted the plague after stealing Abner's corpse to curtail his afterlife powers. Although Duran wants to notify health authorities, Chee persuades the impatient deputy to give Payne, whom he has verified as a rare expert in the field, another 36 hours to locate the colony before alarming the Center for Disease Control. In meantime, the media is informed that the priests died of food contamination.Payne continues to chart the bats' movement and gets closer to the nesting area after finding two of the dead missionaries. As soon as Duran hears about the campsite attack, he sets out to find Anne and rendezvous with Payne in the desert. There, Payne is equipped with a truck that operates as a mobile laboratory. Following tire tracks from the camper van, the two men locate Anne and help her recover from dehydration.
Meanwhile, Payne is confident that the bats' lair is located within sacred Maski Canyon and explains to Duran that once the exact cave has been identified, he will release a poisonous gas and exterminate the colony.During the daytime, Payne sets up his equipment at the entrance to the canyon. At sunset, he, Anne, and Duran remain inside a wire mesh cage rigged with an electrical current and wait for the night creatures to find them. As the colony surrounds them, Payne fires an electronic tracking dart into one of the bats.The next day, Payne follows the dart signal and climbs to the top opening of the bats' lair. While preparing to release the gas, Payne accidentally falls into the cave. However, he is able to clutch a rope in time and hangs precariously above a pool of ammonia surrounded by jagged rocks. Meanwhile, Duran accesses the cave through a lower entrance and chews on the datura root to expand his senses. Despite his insistence that Anne stay behind, she follows him. When Duran sees Payne dangling above, he instructs the scientist to swing his body toward the soft sand of the cave floor, then cut the rope. Payne survives the fall, but is severely injured. Meanwhile, the bats begin to stir as sunset nears.Under the influence of the root, Duran sees Abner's painting on the cave floor and uses shale rock to re-close the circular border. As the creatures attack, Duran fulfills his destiny as a warrior and ignites the formation of shale rocks, creating a powerful ring of fire that destroys the vampire bat colony and engulfs the cave, apparently killing all the bats. Carrying Payne, Duran and Anne escape outside. As the threesome recuperate, Duran looks at the burning caves and believes that Abner used his powers to summon the fires to protect the sacred Maski Canyon from mining interests."

Michael finds he has many hurdles to overcome. There is a dwindling congregation, his main job to increase church membership. Anne Woods, the church secretary and daughter of the previous longtime reverend who retired, likes the way things have always been done at the church, which includes she and her father having chaired all the church committees in an ""if you want things done, do it yourself"" mentality. He finds that she is partly right in that many of the congregants, while well meaning, indeed would bungle such responsibility even if they did have an interest. In running the church, he finds that he runs into what he considers a bigger problem in the town as a whole, namely that there exists illegal gambling on a large scale by organized crime, in essence what he believes controls the town administration. After hearing Michael passionately speak, albeit impromptu in place of what was supposed to be a standard prayer, against the illegal gambling on a televised public service announcement, he gets chastised by Anne and the church presbytery for politicking. However, special investigators Marv Fogleman and Tom Voories with the Treasury Department, ask, on the sly, for Michael's help in breaking up the organized illegal gambling in New Campton, all they wanting being a few trustworthy men to make a few bets at the known bookie sites and testify as such in court. With none of the male congregants willing to get involved, Michael is only able to provide five female congregants, and one honorary ""female"" member, they a disparate bunch but eager to do their part. Despite Marv's belief that the six may be able to pull it off in the crime syndicate never suspecting a bunch of ""ditzy"" women, they instead bungle things so badly as to get Marv to the point of a nervous breakdown. With or without the Treasury Department support, Michael and his six ""operatives"" decide to aim for what will be the most damaging but most difficult aspect of the syndicate to locate and shut down, namely their ""bank"". With Michael already a known from the PSA and as the six become more and more known to the crime syndicate, their lives may be placed into jeopardy in their entirety, from their relationships to friends and family who are on a need to know basis, to their livelihoods including Michael's, to their lives. The church itself may also be placed at risk if Max Roca, the head of the syndicate, feels they as a collective are becoming too much of an irritant.

He awakens to a special alarm clock that activates his home stereo system, waking him to his favorite music.

After breakfast, Bill goes to the supermarket, driving his unique classic automobile, a meticulously preserved 1930s model Pierce-Arrow; he compulsively takes two orange parking cones out of the trunk and places them in the two parking spaces next to his, to block anybody from parking near his car.

Max apparently lived with Bill before being confined to the facility due to his despondent condition; Max has retreated into his mind and hasn't spoken a word in years, refusing to react to external stimulus. Bill still makes a habit of visiting him daily, cheerfully telling him about everything that's going on. He tells Max about Kate, saying that he feels as if he has to help her, although he doesn't know how. Later, Bill also receives a visit from his daughter, Shirl (Lorraine Gary) and her husband, Harris (Nicolas Coster). Shirl feels Bill is becoming senile and she tries to get him to sign a document that will give Shirl control over his bank account; when Bill refuses, Shirl becomes furious, complaining that Bill is giving away all of his money, but Bill angrily rebuffs her.Meanwhile, Demesta is in a rage about Kate's betrayal. He questions Roy (Christopher Knight), a teenage friend of Kate's, in an intimidating way and tells him that he'll find Kate wherever she is. When Bill goes to get a prescription for painkillers refilled, Demesta sees him in the pharmacy, but is unaware that he is connected to Kate.Stan and Sue step up their interfering and call Shirl to tell her they saw a young girl in Bill's house. When Shirl returns, she demands to see Kate but Bill refuses to let her in the house. He also refuses to acknowledge that he's harboring a juvenile, denying anything is wrong, much to Shirl's dismay and fury. Shirl suggests to Harris in a private moment that her father has been unstable ever since his vaudeville career went bad, identifying a disatrous show in Pittsburgh as the turning point. Harris thinks Shirl just misunderstands Bill, and encourages her to accept Bill's eccentric ways.Bill and Kate have a conversation where she reveals to him that she's on the run from a drug dealer. She claims Demesta gave her money to make a connection and pay for a cache of product, which she then threw into a sewer in a moment of panic. Bill tells her to go to the police, but Kate is afraid to do this because of the consequences for herself. Bill is happy that Kate has opened up to him finally; he genuinely likes her and feels that she has never had a nurturing home, being shuttled between foster homes. He invites her to come live with him, but Kate tells him that one has to be a certain age to be a foster parent. ""I'm not old enough?"" he jokes.Bill's poker buddies, whom he calls the ""No Shirt Gang"", all arrive to play cards at Bill's house, and he introduces Kate to them. They promise to be discreet about her presence, and the evening is interrupted when Shirl makes good on her promise to return with the police. The No Shirt gang hides Kate with a magic trick, levitating her up to the ceiling. When the girl can't be found, Shirl is even more furious.The next day, Bill leaves for his daily visit to Max, and he has a conversation with Kate, explaining Max's situation to her. Kate feels as if Max may need some tough love, recalling a young boy she once knew who also refused to talk. Kate tells Bill that the boy started talking once all the other kids ignored him. When Bill visits Max, he tells Max that he will never come to see him again; unless Max talks, it's goodbye forever. As a result, Max breaks down and begs Bill not to leave, and they embrace. Bill returns to the house excitedly to tell Kate the good news, but he finds that Kate is gone and the house is empty. Bill is despondent.Meanwhile, Kate returns to her foster home and gets a few of her belongings. She meets up with Roy at school, and Roy warns her that Demesta is looking for her. Then Kate reveals what really has her scared: she never made the connection in the first place, and still has the $20,000 cash that Demesta gave her to pay for the drugs. Roy is shocked and tells Kate that Demesta will kill her if he finds her, but Kate plans to leave town with the money. When Roy tells Kate that Demesta has been questioning everybody about Bill, Kate is horrified that Demesta knows where she was hiding, and that any moment now he will track down Bill's house and confront him.She returns to Bill's house, unable to leave town without making sure her new friend is aware of the danger he's in. While she is there, Demesta forces his way into the house; Kate has the $20,000 in her teddy bear, but she and Bill manage to subdue Demesta. After a chase through Bill's house, Bill holds Demesta at bay with a sword, forcing him into a large bag covered in padlocks. When they have him incapacitated, Bill reveals that the sword is a fake, one of Max's props from his magic act.With the police summoned and Demesta arrested, Bill and Kate celebrate by drinking tomato juice. Shirl arrives and is terrified when she sees the police at Bill's house, but Bill talks to her about the strange events that have been going on. Then he asks Shirl a favor.We then see Bill back at the rest home; Max is packing his belongings, preparing to go back home with Bill. Bill explains that Shirl and Harris have agreed to act as foster parents for Kate, and that Kate will stay with Bill and Max on the weekends. The film ends as Bill and Max walk out to greet Kate, who is guarding Bill's car by making sure nobody parks near it."
My Brilliant Career,1979,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0079596/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A proud young woman in early 20th century Australia must choose between marriage and independence. Sybylla Melvyn is an independent young woman who soon after arriving to live with her grandmother, and aunt announces she'll never marry and plans on having a career instead. She attracts the interest of several suitors; bumbling Englishman Frank Hawdon, her handsome neighbour, the handsome young farmer, Harry Beecham, who she's attracted to.—garykmcd In 1897, Sybylla Melvyn has just entered young womanhood. She is still living at home with her poor farming parents in the Australian outback. She considers herself to be unattractive but clever. She dreams of a ""brilliant"" creative-oriented career, such as in the arts, but she is not yet ready to strike out on her own despite her spirited independent streak. She sees that independence as being incompatible with marriage which her elders seem to feel is the next logical step in her life. She welcomes her mother's decision for her to live with her wealthy maternal grandmother, especially considering the alternative which is to accept a job as a servant. That move is so that she can learn to be a proper young woman to attract that husband. Her Aunt Helen encourages her to marry a man she likes with prospects rather than marry a man she loves without prospects. In the former category is jackaroo Frank Hawdon, although Sybylla does not even seem to like him. In the latter category is Harry Beecham, an acquaintance from her childhood. He is a wealthy landowner, who has his pick of any woman he wants as his wife. Regardless of how she feels for Harry and how Harry may feel for her, she still may not see marriage as being part of her immediate future. But factors outside of her control may dictate what happens in Sybylla's life.—Huggo Australia, 1890s. A young woman, Sybylla Melvyn, is stuck in a rural area but dreams of a career in the arts, ideally as a writer. Her ambitions are at odds with her family's aims for her and with broader society's views on a woman's path in life. She meets a young man and the two are soon close. Will she have to choose between her career and him?—grantss For her award-winning breakthrough film, directorGillian Armstrongdrew on teenage authorMiles Franklin's novel, a celebrated turn-of-the-twentieth-century Australian coming-of-age story, to brashly upend the conventions of period romance. Headstrong young Sybylla Melvyn (Judy Davis, in a star-making performance), bemoans her stifling life in the backcountry, where her writerly ambitions receive little encouragement, and craves independence above all else. When a handsome landowner (Sam Neill), disarmed by her unruly charms, begins to court her, Sybylla must decide whether she can reconcile the prospect of marriage with the illustrious life's work she has imagined for herself. Suffused with generous humor and a youthful appetite for experience, My Brilliant Career is a luminous portrait of an ardently free spirit. The heroine, Sybylla Melvyn, is an imaginative, headstrong girl growing up in rural Australia in the 1890s. Drought and a series of poor business decisions reduce her family to subsistance level, her father begins to drink excessively, and Sybylla struggles to deal with the monotony of her life. To her relief, she is sent to live on her grandmother's property, where life is more comfortable. There she meets wealthy young Harry Beecham, who loves her and proposes marriage; convinced of her ugliness and aware of her tomboyish ways, Sybylla is unable to believe that he could really love her. By this time, her father's drinking has got the family into debt, and she is sent to work as governess/housekeeper for the family of an almost illiterate neighbour to whom her father owes money. She becomes acclaimated to this life to the point where it is almost bearable, but to her relief (again) is sent home (this time) to keep her away from her crass employer's son who has apparantely fallen for her (and, ironically, since she has no property, she is deemed unsuitable as the son's mate). When Harry Beecham returns to ask Sybylla to marry him, she concludes that she would only make him unhappy and sends him away, determined to pursue her career as a writer. The movie ending completes the suggestion, made at the begining, that this entire screenplay is based on her first book, as we see her putting the manuscript in a mailbox in front of her parent's ramshacle house. (A suggestion that this movie is the story of her Brilliant Career.....or how it got its start anyway)."

After the meeting, Marenkov requests that the Project's Director, Colonel Nikolai Bunin, travel to Zurich, Switzerland, to assist in trapping the suspected culprit, a spy known by the code name Angelo.At a train station in Switzerland, a team of American intelligence agents, led by Colonel Harry Wargrave (Lee Marvin) and his associates, Elsa Lang (Linda Evans), Leroy (Joe Nameth) and Neckerman (Arthur Brauss), retrieves the latest cassette tape sent by their Soviet informant Angelo. The tape is discreetly transferred among Wargrave's team until it reaches the hands of Haller, the superior officer, who is waiting on a private jet. After decoding the recording, Haller, Harry and Elsa listen as Angelo announces that this tape will be his final one and requests that the Americans meet him next Friday in Milan, Italy, during the noon tour at the La Scala opera house. Angelo explains that the position of the militarist hardliners is becoming more powerful in the Soviet Union, and subsequently Project Winter Harvest has been reactivated under the leadership of Bunin. With his cover threatened, he plans to defect immediately.Three days later during the opera house tour, Harry and Leroy wait for the rendezvous with Angelo whom they have never met. Suddenly, from behind the curtain of a private box, Marenkov reveals himself to be the informer, Angelo. While escorting Marenkov to a safe house in Milan, the Americans subdue and foil enemy agents who try and stop them. Because Marenkov is the third most powerful official in the Soviet Union, Haller suggests they need to bury him in a missile site to protect him. On the contrary, Marenkov wants to give the Soviets and Bunin a chance to come after him, which will expose the Soviet network of elite undercover agents and provide the Americans with a chance to defeat Bunin and Winter Harvest.Meanwhile at a covert location in Zurich, Bunin receives a telegram from Moscow reporting that the attempt to trap Angelo in Milan failed; therefore, Bunin must assume control of the European clandestine network consisting of Soviet agents planted under the deepest cover. Bunin updates Rudi Muehler, who has nurtured this network for years and is reluctant to hand it over, that Marenkov is the spy Angelo. Since Marenkov possesses the most classified information, his defection is not a routine intelligence operation but a political crisis. In order to kill Marenkov, Bunin must have access to Muehler's elite agents and issues orders for them to be war-ready.Back at the Milan safe house, Harry proposes that they accompany Marenkov on the Atlantic Express train from Italy to Holland. Despite the risks, Harry persuades Haller that the scheme could flush out Soviet agents who have been in reserve for over twenty years, as long as they can keep Marenkov safe as bait. Through a series of decoys, the American agents sneak Marenkov on the train at the Milan station and keep him under close guard; however, Soviet agent Olga (Sylvia Langova) soon delivers intelligence to Bunin about the plan. Bunin orders Muehler to organize an attack, and confidently tells Olga that he already has two undercover agents positioned in separate cars of the Express.After crossing the Swiss border, Harry and his team encounter a unit of Soviet agents who have seized a signal tower along the route, but they defeat the Soviets in an exchange of gunfire that knocks out most of the compartment windows. As the train nears a Swiss mountain pass, an area helicopter communicates with the Express about possible inclement weather.On the Wasserhorn summit, the pilots notice skiers, but they are actually Soviet agents who set off explosive charges, creating an avalanche. The pilots warn Harry that the only option is to take shelter in the upcoming tunnel, but the train operator cannot increase speed and make the tunnel in time unless three wagons are dropped. Meanwhile, the avalanche crushes a nearby village. Using explosives, Harry successfully separates the last three cars before they are buried in the avalanche's path. The rest of the Express enters the safety of the tunnel.Disguised as Professor Heinz Golchak, Bunin checks into a Swiss hotel and meets with Geiger, the leader of a German terrorist cell. In exchange for providing Geiger's associates in hiding with an escape route via a Soviet freighter, Bunin wants the terrorist group to destroy the Atlantic Express, wearing their customary black uniforms and masks. That evening, after passing through tight security at the Zurich train station, Bunin boards the Atlantic Express in disguise, along with Geiger and Geiger's female associate, Helga Mann.In the morning, the Atlantic Express arrives in Maastricht, Holland, and Dutch intelligence officer Scholten goes on board to assist the Americans for the remaining journey. Scholten informs Harry that a Soviet freighter, The Maxim Gorky, is suspiciously lingering in the waters off the coast of Rotterdam, Holland. Meanwhile, Bunin notifies Geiger that one of his men planted weapons in the bathroom ceiling, located behind the engine room. Geiger collects the stash and distributes grenades to Bunin and Helga. As the train is nearing a river bridge, Helga opens the operator compartment and threatens to trigger the grenades if the train does not slow down. As the locomotive comes to a stop, the Geiger Group waiting in the adjacent meadow attacks with machine guns. Grabbing Helga, Leroy leaps overboard into the water, setting off her grenade away from the train. Bunin throws a grenade towards Marenkov's compartment, but the Soviet defector and Elsa escape the blast and jump off the train. Harry shoots Geiger dead and Scholten's men kill the remaining terrorists, but Bunin gets away on a motorboat standing by to take him to the freighter.Harry explains to Scholten the importance of intercepting The Maxim Gorky since it will not only provide refuge for Bunin, but also for valuable Soviet undercover agents. To deceive Bunin, Harry, Marenkov, Elsa and Scholten disguise themselves in the uniforms of the Geiger Group, and proceed to the freighter's location in a torpedo boat. As they approach, Bunin is surprised that these terrorists survived the train assault, but instead of picking them up, he orders the Soviet officers on the freighter to shoot. To counter the attack, Harry and his group fire torpedoes, setting off a series of explosions that destroy everyone on the ship including Bunin.Later, on a plane to the United States, Haller informs Marenkov that Bunin's death and the exposure of the Winter Harvest agenda has weakened the militant hawks in the Soviet government. Content, Marenkov hums a song on his way to a new life in America."

When supervisor, Captain Geiberger (Ossie Davis), informs the group that the task force's funds are being suspended due to a low rate of convictions, the officers are frustrated. They argue that they apprehend plenty of the criminals, but the liberal judges release the outlaws. For the team's final weeks, the captain assigns police sergeant Louise Webster (Suzanne Pleshette) to the unit.After arresting Hymie (Sydney Lassick), the owner of a disreputable pawnshop, and two of his customers, for trafficking stolen goods, Doug conceives an idea for the task force to establish an undercover fencing operation. Using their remaining departmental budget, they can take over Hymie's shop, buy contraband, and catch thieves without searching for them, all without violating entrapment rules since the crime occurs before the arrest. Louise, who is experienced with surveillance, suggests videotaping the transactions, which will help ensure convictions in court. The captain is intrigued and obtains approval from the police chief, but on condition that Miami police will deny the scheme if the media finds out.As the first order of business, the team arranges for Hymie to take an extended vacation. Next, Louise sets up a hidden camera behind a two-way mirror to videotape customers at the counter. As a way of encouraging repeat business, Ernie and Doug pay top prices for stolen goods, while Ramon handles the accounts and keeps track of customer names and addresses. Furthermore, to enhance their reputation among criminal sellers, the team gives the impression of being members of organized crime.One night, three holdup men enter the shop pointing guns and steal all cash on hand, but the officers are unable to react because they do not want to expose the operation. After the incident, Ernie obtains a watchdog, named Jaws, who looks friendly, but happens to be a trained killer. The team buys a variety of stolen loot, ranging from harmonicas to chickens, and keeps track of the inventory in the back warehouse. Soon, a steady stream of petty thieves frequents the pawnshop.After the captain remarks that the customers should look more directly towards the camera, the team decorates the border of the two-way mirror with nude pictures of women. Unaware of the scheme, Lieutenant Kiley (Barney Martin) from the Miami Police Organized Crime Unit stops by and says he will investigate the shop unless he receives a weekly payment of $1,000. When he leaves, Louise is satisfied that she captured the corrupt officer on camera.Another day or two later, Florida mafia boss, Carmine (Marc Lawrence), arrives with two of his henchmen. He advises Ernie and Doug to cease claiming that they are part of the mafia ""family"" and orders them to shut down the business. Ernie declares they are members of a powerful out of state crime syndicate that is expanding, but Carmine remains suspicious and threatens to return.During a risky deal with weapons dealers, Doug and Ernie are taken by boat to a construction site and shown a truckload of machine guns for sale. They wear wires, while Louise and Ramon follow close behind and record the conversation. When the dealers demand immediate payment, Ernie and Doug reveal their police badges and weapons. A gunfight ensues, but the team finally outwits and apprehends the crooks.Back at the pawnshop, a boy delivers a dead fish, which Ernie interprets as a mafia death threat, and, later, the team is nearly the victim of a bomb that Carmine disguises in a Cuban cigar box. With their spending budget nearly exhausted and the warehouse stacked with stolen goods, the task force and the captain prepare to end the operation.To make arrests without arousing suspicion, they throw a party and invite all their criminal customers. During the festivities of food, drinks, and dancing, the captain plays the role of the team's mafia boss, and guests are required to walk through a metal detector before entering. As everyone is enjoying the party, Ernie announces to the crowd of petty thieves that he and his colleagues are police officers and everyone is under arrest, but the guests do not believe him and laugh. As he tries to convince the crowd, Carmine and his thugs barge into the party. Carmine declares that he will not tolerate encroachment into his territory, and Ernie and Doug are knocked to the ground. The action sparks a fight as the petty thieves enter the fracas. Screaming that he only has two days left until retirement, Ernie backs away from Carmine, who is pointing a gun at him, but the bullets miss, and Ernie is only soiled by ketchup. As Miami police units finally arrive on the scene, the petty thieves and the mafia men are divided into separate groups and transported to prison.Later, at Ernie's home, the captain reports to the task force that the operation resulted in 250 arrests and 231 convictions. The captain also happily announces that, instead of retiring, Ernie will be promoted to assistant director for the new burglary task force. As everyone goes home for the evening, a burglar sneaks out of Ernie's house with a television set."

King Frat,1979,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0079406/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Frat boys compete in a farting contest. Set on the quiet campus of Yellowstream University, this comedy follows the rivalries that build between two of the college's fraternities. When they're not mooning everyone they pass and throwing garbage on the lawns of rival frats, the members of the Pi Kappa Delta fraternity are mainly interested in drinking and... well, drinking. When a campus- wide farting contest is announced, Grossout, the leader of the Deltas, is all too eager to stand up, bend over and defend the honor of his fraternity.—Jean-Marc Rocher <rocher@fiberbit.net> Over the opening credits, five members of Yellowstream University's Pi Kappa Delta fraternity, including J. J. ""Grossout"" Gumbroski (John DiSanti), ""Splash"" (Ray Mann) and ""Jock,"" (Mike Grabow) drive around the streets of Coral Gables, Florida, drinking beer and sticking their bare bottoms (mooning) out the windows of their converted hearse. They offend sorority girls, members of the patrician Omega Alpha fraternity, and townspeople, but when Grossout breaks wind in the face of jogging university president Robert J. McGafferty, the middle-aged man suffers a fatal heart attack.Meanwhile, two Omega Alpha members visit Dean Delbert Doyle (Dan Fitzgerald) in his office to complain about the ""Pi Kaps,"" and Doyle promises he will institute a new strategy to ""straighten them out,"" just like he did when he was formerly a prison warden. When the students remind him that the inmates burned down the prison under his regime, Doyle chokes with suppressed rage.Elsewhere, Grossout and the Pi Kaps return to their fraternity house with a dozen cases and several kegs of beer. Inside, fraternity ""brothers"" drink while they watch a film taken by a hidden camera in the locker room of the women's gym. Splash, an African American, pays his tuition by working as a janitor for the Omega Alphas, but he urinates in the water he uses to mop the floors, and when he returns to the Pi Kappa house, he carries a bag of stolen items.Kevin (Robert Small), the fraternity's only scholar, asks fellow Pi Kap ""Chief Latrine,"" (Dan Chandler) a member of the Kissawong Indian tribe whose land the university now occupies, how the town and university came to be called Yellowstream. The chief explains that after his ancestors were forced to move upstream, they always urinated in the river flowing through town.Later, Grossout reads on the front page of the local newspaper, The Daily Crock, that an upcoming ""Big Fart Contest"" will pay $500 to the winner. Being the most gaseous Pi Kap, infamous for his flatulence, he decides to become a contestant, but first the fraternity has to raise the $50 entrance fee.During President McGafferty's funeral, Splash and Grossout sneak hashish into the church and burn it with a blowtorch next to a heating vent. Smoke fills the church, affecting mourners, and even McGafferty's family starts giggling. As he gives the eulogy, Dean Doyle becomes enraged at the president's corpse for allowing Pi Kappa Delta on campus. Several mourners stop him when he grabs the deceased's lapels and drags him out of the coffin. Shutting the lid, they accidentally shove the coffin, mounted on wheels, out the front door and into the back of the Pi Kaps' hearse. Grossout and Splash drive the coffin to the fraternity house and carry it inside.Tommy Matthews (Roy Sekoff), a new pledge, arrives with his parents, who are appalled by the condition of the Pi Kappa Delta house and the empty beer cans laying everywhere. Kevin promises them that, for a bribe of $500, Tommy will not undergo the fraternity's grueling initiation, which includes a chainsaw. Practicing for the ""Big Fart Contest,"" Grossout experiments with different foods, but Chief Latrine's special Indian ""buffalo punch"" makes him explosively flatulent and blows him into a wall.After Tommy's parents leave, Grossout teaches him how to drink beer at a Chinese restaurant. The secret to drinking all night, he tells Tommy, is to vomit. In the restaurant kitchen, he demonstrates by sticking a finger down his throat and vomiting into a vat of soup. To avoid paying the group's bill, Grossout drinks milk, falls on the floor, and foams at the mouth. The management helps the students rush him out.At the farting contest, Grossout is intimidated by ""Bucky"" Zackabreski (Karen Gold), his former high school girl friend, whose flatulence is more spectacular than his. Grossout's only hope is the chief's ""buffalo punch,"" but unfortunately, a dog drinks it first, and a sudden flatus sends the animal flying across the stage. Grossout is disqualified when he soils himself.Later, during a Pi Kap costume party, Grossout and Splash slip away to the nearby Omega Alpha house and steal a statue of Dionysus, which has been a fraternity ""mascot"" for generations. The next morning, when the statue is reported missing, Doyle and campus security Officer Percy (T.J. Tully) arrive at the Pi Kap house and find everyone passed out. As ""Griselda,"" Grossout's inflatable love doll, repeats ""I love you"" over and over, the dean takes Percy's gun and shoots it, sending the doll flying around the room.That night, Fred (Charles Pitt), the straight-laced Pi Kap president, wears a gorilla costume when he takes Tommy to spy on a sorority, but while peeking through an upstairs window, Fred falls from a tree. When an ambulance arrives, one of the sorority sisters, Betty (Rahnee Reiland), rides in back with him to the hospital. Straddling Fred as she tries to help him breathe and take off his suit, she is accidentally thrown against him during the rough ride, and Fred's erection becomes stuck inside her. At the emergency room, the attendants fail to pry them loose, so they put Frank's gorilla mask back on his head and place a paper bag over Betty's head to protect their anonymity as they are wheeled through the hospital.Joan (Suzina Volpina), Tommy's girl friend, is a nice sorority girl who will not have sex with him, so Fred and Grossout use some of his parents' $500 to take him to Veronica's Massage Parlor. Veronica (Jean Jarvis) promises to send ""Monica,"" her ""super girl,"" but when Monica arrives, she turns out to be Joan.Meanwhile, Boyd (Glenn Scherer) and Lloyd (Lee Krug), the leaders of the Omega Alphas, suspect Splash as the Dionynus thief and beat him up. When Splash stumbles home, an enraged Grossout smashes the statue and throws the head through a window of the Omega Alpha house.The Omega Alphas raid the Pi Kaps house, but Kevin turns the tide by lighting Grossout's flatulence with a blowtorch, creating a flamethrower that scatters the attackers. The police arrive, arrest the Pi Kaps, and find President McGafferty's embalmed body sitting on a toilet.In the Dade County courthouse, Doyle appeals to Judge Lester Crumneagle (Lee Sandman) to throw the Pi Kaps off campus, but Kevin, who has been researching old maps and titles of the Kissawong tribe, provides evidence that the tribe owns the university.At the film comes to an end, the name of Yellowstream U. is changed to Kissawong U., and Grossout is elected university president."

He tells her that she is really beautiful. He kisses her and wants to have sex with her. She finally stops him, screaming and crying. He asks what the matter was, as it seems an exaggerated reaction. She says that she doesn't know what the matter is.Esther speaks with her afraid about the incident. She found particularly annoying that he put away his clothes very neatly when he undressed. Esther saw his dick and his balls, and he compares everything with a turkey.
Esther is very excited because she has won a four-week trip to New York to work at a women's magazine, all expenses paid, including the hotel.

Her mother only regrets that Esther didn't have more friends. Esther denies to have been a lonely child. The mother takes a photo of her, and tells her to stop fooling around putting an apple on her mouth. The mother tells her that Esther has become la créme of the world, but Esther regrets not having so much money and silk sweaters as her classmates; some of them even had horses that they would take to school. Her mother says something obvious - that happened because those girls' parents were rich. The mother changes the subject, and says that she has joined a folk dancing class. Both laugh about the ridiculous hand-made hat she has made. Esther asks why she hasn't married again, and her mother says it's complicated. Esther says that she may find somebody during the dancing lessons, but the mother says that it would have to be somebody her daughter likes. Esther thinks that quite a ridiculous notion, as she doesn't even live at home anymore, but Mother says that during the holidays she lives there. Esther asks why she didn't let her go to Dad's funeral. Mother says that Esther was too young and that he didn't suffer. Mother doesn't want to keep on talking about that, but Esther complains that she doesn't even know what he died from. Mother ends up saying that some things are better left alone. Esther would do anything her father wanted, although on some other occasions she used to have a temper as a child. Mother seems to be jealous of Esther and her father's close relationship. She wants to know if there was any blood - finally, her mother starts crying.They finally go to a restaurant with John Gilling (Scott McKay), a rich man who has invited them and will pay.

The Evictors,1979,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0079128/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A nice young couple move into an eerie house which is located in a small Louisiana town, unaware of its violent history, and soon find themselves tormented by the previous owners. A young couple, just married, rents a house in a village in Louisiana. But they are not welcome because the inhabitants of the village look upon them with distrust. Meanwhile, in the house they rented, were happening strange things from the past...—Volker Boehm In 1928, near Shreveport, Louisiana, sheriffs deputies accompany banker Benjamin Sanford to the farmhouse occupied by the Monroe family who have been served with several eviction notices. Inside the house, Dwayne Monroe (Glen Roberts) and his brother, Todd, who wears eyeglasses with a cracked lens, prepare to fight for the property, while Dwayne's wife, Anna, gathers ammunition. When Sanford presents a court order to immediately vacate the premises, the brothers initiate a shootout with police. As additional officers arrive, the living room is riddled with bullets, and the three Monroes fall to the floor.Nearly twenty years later, in 1942, real estate agent Jake Rudd (Vic Morrow) sells the former Monroe farmhouse to a young couple, Ben and Ruth Watkins (Michael Parks and Jessica Harper), from New Orleans, Louisiana, who have relocated for Ben's new job at the cotton mill. Soon after unpacking, however, Ruth finds an anonymous note in the mailbox scribbled, ""I want you to move"", but Ben dismisses it as a juvenile prank. Ruth is further alarmed when a local peddler, Roy Lee, informs her that previous owners, Mr. and Mrs. Mullins (John Meyer and Mary Branch), were mysteriously killed on the property in 1934. That night, Ruth screams when she sees a man outside the kitchen window. The intruder disappears, but Ben notices footprints on the porch and thinks the man might be a vagrant looking for a place to sleep.The next morning, Ben travels to Arkansas on business, while Ruth visits the friendly widow next door, Olie Gibson (Sue Ane Langdon), who is confined to a wheelchair. Olie confirms that a violent incident did happen at the Monroe house in 1934 and reveals that another tragedy occurred five years later.During Christmas 1939, owner Frank Rhinehart (John Milam) was electrocuted while fixing the fuse box, and the body of his wife Ethel (Roxanne Harter) was found burned to death nearby.The following day, Ruth hears footsteps upstairs. At that moment, Ben telephones from the train station in Arkansas to say that he will be arriving home that evening. Ruth tries to alert Ben to the intruder in the house, but there is a poor connection, so Ben hangs up. When Ruth sees a man at the top of the stairs, she breaks open the kitchen door, which the intruder barred shut from the outside, and escapes to Olie's house, unharmed.Later that night, Ben picks up his wife at Olie's home and asks the old woman if she has a gun he can borrow. From a locked room, Olie retrieves a rifle that belonged to her late husband. After Ben searches the farmhouse and finds no one, Ruth tells him that she wants to move back to New Orleans, but Ben reminds her about his commitment to the new job.The next day, Ben purchases a handgun and teaches Ruth how to shoot. Sometime later, Ben calls Ruth from the mill to say that he must work extra hours and instructs his wife to stay with Olie that evening until he gets home. Taking the handgun with her, Ruth knocks on Olie's door, but no one answers. She returns to the farmhouse and discovers the phone is not working.Meanwhile, Ben decides to leave work after being unable to reach his wife or Olie on the telephone. When Ruth sees the intruders shadow on the front porch, she fires the gun repeatedly at him, but misses and eventually runs out of bullets. The intruder breaks the living room window with a machete, but retreats at the sight of a car approaching. As Ben enters the dark house, Ruth thinks he is the intruder and shoots him. As soon as she realizes her mistake, she tries to help her wounded husband, but the intruder returns and chases her to the bedroom, where he grabs her. After struggling up the stairs, Ben shoots and injures the intruder, who falls out the window and scurries away. Later at the hospital, Ben dies.During the funeral, Olie appears distraught and goes home where she finds the wounded intruder, Dwayne Monroe, sleeping in the locked room. He wakes and threatens her with a machete. Angry, Olie takes off her disguise and is revealed to be Anna Monroe. She orders her deranged husband to put the weapon down and reminds Dwayne that their revenge plan has always succeeded, ever since they escaped with Todd during the raid in 1928. Although the gun battle left her crippled, she will never allow anyone to live in their old farmhouse. However, Dwayne screams that he is tired of being confined to the bedroom, except when called upon to murder new inhabitants next door. He then kills Olie as she tries to leave.After Ben's funeral, Ruth stops by Olie's house to say goodbye. As she goes inside and calls out for her friend, Dwayne surprises her, but Jake Rudd hears Ruth screaming and arrives in time to shoot Dwayne dead.Five years later, Ruth lives in town and is remarried to Rudd. One day, Mr. and Mrs. Bumford arrive at Rudd's office and announce that they want to pay cash for a house along Route 2. Rudd puts on his cracked eyeglasses, revealing his true identity as Todd Monroe, and hands over the necessary paperwork for the Bumfords to review. When Rudd informs Ruth that the Bumfords are buying the Monroe farmhouse, she says that he promised her no one would ever live in that house again. Apparently Jake Rudd and Ruth have now taken over the Monroe's family tradition of continuing to kill to keep the family house vacant.In a closing text, it is revealed that on the following year, Mrs. Bumford was found dead in the well behind the house and three months later, the coroner determines that Mr. Bumford committed suicide.

Peter Lenz, a mogul merrily funds terrorists to boost his computer sales, by panicking West German government and industry c. 1980, as the third generation of Western European left-wing activists forms, after crippling of the violent Red Army Faction. International capitalist PJ Lurz's secretary is a gang member, while her Polizeikommissar father-in-law/lover hired Lurz' corporate security force. On February 27, Carnival Tuesday, these young terrorists kidnap Peter Lenz.—David Stevens A wildly anarchic satire of urban guerrilla warfare in which a band of leftist radicals inadvertently become puppets of the West German government, which uses them to justify its authoritarian policies. Taking aim at the entire spectrum of political ideologies, THE THIRD GENERATION stands as one ofRainer Werner Fassbinder's most provocative and explosively controversial explorations of power and control. The Third Generation was once regarded as a highly controversial film in Germany. The Film opens in a high rise overlooking Berlin, Germany, as the sound of a heart beating and the T.V. are heard. Peter Lurz (Eddie Constantine), a well to do and established man in his 60s who sells computers, is looking out the window as his secretary Susanne Gast (Hanna Schygulla) is on the phone behind him. A man in his mid 50s wearing a putty colored trench coat and a hat, Officer Gerhard Gast (Hark Bohm), who's there to pick up Susanne, his daughter in law, engages in a conversation with Lurz. Officer Gast tells Lurz that he is being watched and is under police protection. In route of taking his daughter in-law home for dinner they both have a sexual experience at a hotel room. While having dinner with the whole family, Grandpa Gast (Claus Holm) tells the husband of Susanne, Edgar Gast (Udo Kier) that every generation needs a war. In all this we see visuals pop up of reported headlines of racial and hateful graffiti in public places. Susanne makes her rounds to other contacts. She approaches Hilde Kriger (Bulle Ogier), a school teacher, and tells her ""The world as will and idea,"" a common code phase that is used amongst the terrorist.
This is when sound takes the floor in this movie. Characters are introduced sporadically. August Brem (Volker Spengler) approaches Rudolf Mann (Harry Baer) in a record store where he works. The phrase ""the world as will and idea"" is spoken to him almost like a calling. Petra Vielhabor (Margrit Carstensen) who argues with her husband Hans (Jurgen Draegon) constantly gets the calling. During this time, when all of the characters are introduced, they are surrounded by noise from music, T.V. and radio. They are all extremely paranoid and tense. Their are to meet at Rudolf's apartment so they could meet Paul (Raul Grimenez), their so called leader of the terrorist group. While at the apartment they almost agree to kick out Ilse Hoffman (Y So Lo), a drug addict. They feel that she is a threat. August mentions it first to Rudolph who does nothing because he has compassion for her. Paul arrives and their so excited to see him for the first time. He makes forced arrangements to stay with Hilde in her apartment and rapes her. Two visitors come to see Ilse, Franz Walsch (Günther Kaufman) and Bernhard Von Stein (Vitus Zepichal). Franz is a long time friend and lover of Ilse. They decide to stay with her and help her drug problem. The others find books in Von Stein's suitcase and start tossing it around as Von Stein cries for it back. They act like children playing in a field.
Times are tense and get even worse when Paul is gunned down at a restaurant in front of Edgar who's faced by his father at the site. They are all afraid and decide to change their identity. August gives out paper squares to the group. Some have a mark and some don't. Petra, Rudolf and Hilde got the mark and had to break into the post office. Rudolph peed in his pants, he was so scared. The others laugh when they get back but not for long when Franz finds Ilse dead. Petra and some of the other terrorists rob the very bank that Petra's husband works in. While they are escaping, Petra shoots and kills her husband. They frantically change their looks and names and flee from their homes.
Von Stein is seriously interrogated by Officer Gast as to their whereabouts. Von Stein genuinely doesn't know but gets curious and follows August undetected. He sees Lurz give August money to fund terrorism at a Chinese restaurant. August sets up Franz by telling him where Ilse is buried. He then calls the authorities and gets him killed. August does the same to Petra when she is instructed to place a bomb and gets intercepted and killed by police. Von Stein is caught by Officer Gast at the cemetery when he tried to warn Franz that it was a setup and not to go to Ilse's grave. Von Stein tells Officer Gast of what he saw at the Chinese restaurant and mysteriously falls down a long flight of stairs and is killed. Paul Lurz is willingly kidnapped by the remaining terrorists and videotaped in a basement as he slates his name and his position in the state."

Kaala Patthar,1979,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0079386/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Inspired by a true mining tragedy the film is about people from all walks of life showing courage and character to fight the forces of nature. When disaster strikes, three men stand up to fight for the coal miners. Vijay (Amitabh Bachchan) a disgraced ex-naval officer is now working in the coal mine. Ravi (Shashi Kapoor) is an engineer in charge of the doomed project. Mangal (Shatrughan Sinha) is an escaped convict who finds shelter at the coal mine. KAALA PATTHAR is inspired by a true mining tragedy in Bihar.—Official Source Imagine a place so dark that sunlight or hope never touched it. Imagine a place so dark that even dreams are swallowed by its terrible darkness.Imagine a mining town, where the mines are as black and deep and exploited as the lives of the miners who go down it, forced to dig deeper and deeper by the wealthy, greedy owners who care for nothing but profit. So deep in fact that with each passing day, the bowels of the earth threaten to close over their heads in angers, so deep that every trip down the mines is a desperate gamble of life and death.But as the saying goes, where there's life, there's hope, even lives as grindingly grim as that of the miners . And hope comes to town as three men.Vijay (Amitabh Bachchan) an ex-naval officer who is court-martialed and dismissed from the navy for his role in as captain of a ship that sank and many lives were lost. Vijay is looking for a place so dark that even the hideous demons inside him that taunt him so terribly will get scared and go away. He finds that darkness in the depths of the coal mines where he now works as a coal miner, where he welcomes every danger, every threatening rumble of disaster as a chance to pay for his past Ravi (Shashi Kapoor), the engineer in-charge of these doomed mines. Doomed because the greed and mindless exploitation by its owners have made the mines into potential death traps. Ravi, seeing the terrible danger looming ahead, tries to alert the management but with little use. He is paid for his alertness by being fired from his job which is when he joins forces with the workers and Vijay in order to save the lives of the minors and fight the establishment.Mangal (Shatrughan Sinha), an escaped convict who is also looking for a place to hide, but unlike Vijay, not from himself but from the eyes of the law. And discovers that under his boisterous and egoistic exterior is a compassionate human being for whom the law of justice is more important than the law of the jungle. He ends up joining Ravi and Vijay in their fight for right.As these three men set off on their crusade, each of them also find love. From the trusting, simple miners and their families who see these men as messiahs and from three women. Sudha (Raakhee), a doctor who is as kind and caring as she is beautiful and sees Vijay's bleeding, repenting heart behind his stone-hard exterior, Anita (Parveen Babi) a reporter who falls in love with Ravi's fearless, clear-eyed belief in justice and in himself and Shanno (Neetu Singh), a gypsy whose sparkling eyes and racy sales pitch snares even the hardened heart of Mangal.Kaala Patthar, inspired by a real-life mining disaster, is an intensely dramatic film about the human heart. That as long as it beats with love and with hope, there will always be a dawn waiting at end of the blackest of nights. With a multi-star cast, a lively musical score and a nail-biting climax, Yash Chopra has made Kaala Patthar a memorable exception to the exquisitely soft, glamorous love stories that have become his hallmark"

Dead Mountaineer's Hotel,1979,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0204526/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Police gets a call-out to a lonely hotel in the Alps. When an officer gets to the hotel everything seems to be all right. Suddenly, an avalanche cuts them out from the rest of the world, and strange things are going to happen. Because police received an anonymous call from a secluded hotel in the Alps, Inspector Peter Glebsky (Uldis Pucitis) drives his car down a snow-covered winding road in a difficult journey toward the ""Dead Mountaineer's"" Hotel. While that sounds a little bit morbid and perhaps does not make this appear to be the ideal vacation retreat, the hotel makes up for it with booze, billiards, a mini-nightclub and the scenery. When Glebsky arrives, he notices hang gliders overhead. Upon entering the hotel, the owner Alex Snewahr (Jüri Järvet) points out that the hotel's name, ""Dead Mountaineer's,"" refers to the fact that a climber perished here after falling from a cliff. He left only his faithful dog. a St. Bernard called Lel, behind. In the hotel there is a rather bleak portrait of the climber near which faithful Lel likes to sleep. Snewahr reports that all is well to his superiors and that perhaps one of his guests may have phoned in the false alarm. With fog rolling in, Glebsky decides to stay the night and Lei carried his bag to Room No. 7.
After a shower, Glebsky begins to encounter other hotel guests. First he catches a glimpse of a beautiful woman before meeting a man named Hinckus (Mikk Mikiver) who suffers from tuberculosis. Next is the jittery physicist Simon Simonet (Lembit Peterson). The eccentric Simonet first claims to be ""commander of the cyber-forces"" but then confesses to actually being a government physicist working on the top secret ""Midas Project."" He has come there to climb but since there's too much snow to do that, he opts to climb the walls instead. At dinner, Glebsky is introduced to Alex's distant relative Brun (Nijole Ozelyte), who's basically just there loafing and smoking weed along with Olaf Andvarafors (Tiit Härm), the only other guy there under the age of 40. Then there is the attractive and glamorous, though very peculiar-acting Mrs. Proua Moses (Irena Kriauzaite), who's married to the significantly older Mr. Harra Moses (Karlis Sebris). There is also Snewahr's zaftig assistant Kaisa (Kaarin Raid). Their dinner conversation revolves around a debate about the existence of aliens.
Later the guests play billiards and drink at the bar. As they exit the billiard room where Olaf has shown off his game playing brilliance, Simonet hands Glebsky a note which he believed the inspector had dropped. Glebsky chats with Alex over a drink and learns that Mr. Moses has claimed to be some kind of ""traveling businessman"" who just kind of sits back and watches as his wife flirts with anything in pants. Glebsky dances with Mr. Moses. The anonymous note on the floor addressed to Glebsky states that Hinckus is actually a dangerous gangster and homicidal maniac known as ""Owl"" who is hiding out here and is plotting to murder someone. Glebsky then remembers Hinckus was absent from dinner, and he sees his silhouette still reclining on the roof's deck. When he hurries up top, he finds the fur coat has been packed with snow, and that Hinkus has vanished.Before the inspector can confront Hinckus over the validity of those claims, there's an avalanche. Both the power and the phones lines are knocked out and it will take at least a week for someone to dig out the roads leading there.
Olaf is soon found dead in his room. His arm outstretched toward a briefcase and his head rather unnaturally twisted around almost completely backwards. Coinciding with the discovery of the body is the arrival of a mysterious man who just sort of turns up there out of the blue claiming to be a friend of Olaf's. He is Luarvik (Sulev Luik) and proves to be every bit as strange as the other guests when he gains consciousness, claiming that while he knows Olaf though he does not know what he looks like. He seems to be after something in his suitcase, which the inspector has hidden. Luarvik is also pallid, physically weak and needs to sleep a lot.
Glebsky begins an investigation and begins locating and questioning the hotel's guests. Though Hinckus would be high up on the suspect list, he is found knocked out and tied up to a bed. Simon is then found delirious and claiming he found and tried to get romantic with Mrs. Moses' corpse, though she is soon found still alive a short time later. Brun seems curiously unperturbed by the murder of Olaf and even jokes around about it. She does reveal that she saw Hinckus in his fur coat in the hall after 10:00 p.m. A strange contraption is found among Olaf's belongings that Simon hypothesizes is either from the military or outer space. When Hinckus is confronted, he tells Glebsky that he was knocked out and tied up by what he observed as himself. At this point, the murder investigation of Olaf comes to a standstill. Glebsky says his only mistake at this point was not sensing the danger he was in.
Mr. Moses is incensed that his wife was awakened in about all the events that night and that his wife will be questioned by the inspector. When Glebsky enters the Moses's suite, he learns that Mrs. Moses saw Olaf and Brun hand in hand like lovers in the hallway. Glebsky returns to Brun and tells her that she was the last person to see Olaf alive. Brun intimates the details of how she and Olaf were kissing when the avalanche struck. Alex keeps casually bringing up things like aliens and zombies which Alex claims are ""the third state of living organisms"". Glebsky falls asleep and dreams he skis off a high ledge.
Glebsky is awakened by Lel's discovery of a gun in the snow that was likely thrown from the roof. Glebsky reasons that Hinckus was indeed stalking someone. Luarvik has again regained consciousness. Glebsky tries to question the self-described foreigner but with little success. At one point, Glebsky dismisses Mr. Moses from entering the room. Luarvik wants to talk with Olaf even after Glebsky reveals that Olaf has been murdered. Luarvik seems to be searching for something and Glebsky reasons it is the briefcase he confiscated. Luarvik is relieved that Glebsky has it. Luarvik does not understand the need to answer Glebsky's many questions. Finally, Luarvik is weakened and needs rest.
Glebsky begins to conclude that Olaf, Luarvik and Mr. Moses belong to the same gang and do not want that information to be public. Hinckus may have been a rival. Glebsky then states that it may have been a mistake not to associate Moses or Luarvik with Olaf's murder and holding HInckus may be a mistake. He instructs Alex Snewahr to see that everyone is at breakfast the next morning.
Dawn breaks. At breakfast, Glebsky tells those gathered that they are cut off from the outside world but he has sent a message to local police by carrier pigeon that a police helicopter would soon arrive as a ploy to see who would react. After breakfast, Glebsky detains Hinckus calling him the Owl. A physical altercation results in Hinckus injuring Glebsky's arm but is knock unconscious by Simonet's pool cue. HInckus eventually confesses that he is a member of a hit squad sent by the Boss to take out ""The Master"" who pulled a major bank heist but seemed to operate differently than other criminals with his unwillingness to kill hostages. When he completely stopped working with Hinckus's associates, Hinckus was sent to find him. Hinckus insists that a helicopter will soon be arriving and the Boss is coming with three associates to finish the job on Mr. Moses.
Glebsky fails to realize there are forces at work in the realm of the supernatural. Simonet explains that Moses is an alien, sent to observe but made the mistake of interacting with humans and he got caught up working with terrorists who robbed the Second National Bank but are now set on killing him. Luarvik is the space ship pilot who is slowly dying. Olaf and Mrs. Moses are their robots, though they are quite human like. They died when the avalanche hit and the power failed by are brought back to life by backup battery supplies. The four are seeking to escape and return to their planet.
Upon this revelation, Glebsky struggles to believe what he is observing. He struggles with the mindset created by over 40 years of police work based on reason and logic and accepting possibilities that are far beyond his experience. Ultimately, Glebsky decides that Moses has broken the law in the National Bank heist and should be arrested and taken to trial. Burn and Simonet advocate on behalf of the aliens.
Alex and Simon wrestle with the injured Glebsky and a sympathetic Snewahr reclaims the suitcase from its hiding place. Olaf is brought back to life. The quartet of aliens make their break skiing toward the mountains to avoid being hunted by a helicopter that is either gangsters arriving to finish the job, or the government coming to eradicate evidence of an alien encounter. In the mountains the aliens suffer a calamity when they are decimated by rocket releases from the helicopter and killed. The inspector had a chance to do great service to the aliens, but Glebsky behaves like a typical cop, subordinate only to common sense and official instructions which leads to the tragic outcome. He says if they were merely thieves, they got what they deserved, but if they were not of this world, logically there is no reason to care about them. As he explains to the audience in a sepia-toned, on-camera coda, he makes no apologies for how he handled the strange events during his stay, but he does not back down from believing the entire murder plot was tied to something less earthbound. Still, the inspector is plagued by doubts whether he did everything he could. ***"

The Kid with the Golden Arm,1979,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0079372/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Director Chang Cheh reunites the Five Venoms in his second biggest cult hit in the West. It's Lo Meng's most memorable performances whose showdown with fellow Venom Kuo Chue is artistically violent while being graphically artsy. Jin bei tong opens with a group of escort/guards preparing to move a shipment of gold from the local government to an area stricken by famine. One of the guards informs the escort chief, Yang Hu Yun (Sun Chien) that two mercenary fighters named Yen and Fang, are ready for them on the road and will act as scouts. Yang Hu Yun says that the local governors are relying on them to make sure the gold reaches the famine-stricken area, as the people there need it desperately to obtain food. They are awaiting the arrival of a special government agent named Hai To, but he has not arrived yet.One of the guards suddenly comes rushing in, mortally wounded. On his back, in his own blood, are painted the characters for the party responsible for the killing-- the Che Sa gang, a ruthless group of bandits. Yang Hu Yun orders his men to notify Yen, Fang, and a swordsman named Li (Wei Pai) and his girlfriend, who will also be assisting with the gold escort.

Number 4, Brass Head, fights unarmed and wears a brass plate over his forehead, which makes his head butts lethal.The Chiefs are ranked by skill, not age.

But Iron Robe quickly shows his true colors, as a few of the Che Sa grunts are waiting in ambush. They strike at Leng as she starts to move past, but she slays them with a quick sword-draw maneuver, calling Iron Robe despicable. Iron Robe is unrepentant, caring only about winning. Several more Che Sa grunts come out of hiding as Iron Robe himself engages Leng in battle.But Iron Robe's fan is pushed aside by a hurled wine jug.

Unamused and not caring about drunkenness, Iron Robe attacks the man, who fends him off and slays the henchmen using only the wine jug as a weapon. No sooner is Leng safe when the mysterious man who saved her leaps back into the bushes, leaving her once again alone.Yang Hu Yun is leading his main body of men with the wagon containing the gold. Several of the escort service's scouts report in to say that Yen and Fang have slain the Seven Hooks, and that Leng was ambushed by Iron Robe, when a mysterious drunken man rescued her and promptly disappeared. Yang is thoughtful for a moment and realizes that the man must be Hai To, the government agent they'd been awaiting. Hai To is a drunk, who regards wine as his only friend, and that he fights best when he's intoxicated. Thinking another brief moment, he signals to the wagon driver and the convoy begins moving again.Leng meets Li at a tavern in a small town that the escort convoy must pass through. He is concerned about her being late, and she tells him that Iron Robe ambushed her and nearly killed her. The two sit, and the tavernkeeper and the head waiter are seen looking at Leng and Li intently. The head waiter signals to a table attendant who begins to pour wine for them, but suddenly grabs a sword from behind another table. But Li has anticipated this, quickly slaying the waiter with a single lightning sword stroke. The tavernkeeper feigns ignorance, outraged at the killing, until Li produces the sword the waiter used to try and ambush him. Continuing to feign ignorance, the tavernkeeper castigates the head waiter, who was responsible for the conduct of the lesser attendants. But as this is going on, the tavernkeeper is stealthily passed a spear which he uses to attack Li and Leng. The tavernkeeper and head waiter are Silver Spear and Brass Head in disguise, and the other attendants are all Che Sa grunts. As a battle breaks out, Silver Spear is seen glancing at a man standing outside the tavern.Li and Leng fend off the grunts, slaying several in the process, but Li is slowly backed up against one of the tavern walls. When he is close enough, the hidden man outside bursts his hands through the walls of the tavern, striking Li in the back. The man's hands are covered with a sandy substance that have administered a contact poison to Li-- the Sand Palm. Li slays the Sand Palm but is wounded. He and Leng slay several more of the grunts and escape from the tavern. Silver Spear orders his men in pursuit.But the grunt at the head of the pursuit runs smack into Hai To, who blithely walks into the tavern and seats himself as if having no idea what is going on. He gestures to Brass Head and orders a jug of wine. Brass Head glances at Silver Spear, who gestures to the wine racks, directing Brass Head to bring Hai To a jar. Brass Head does so, and Hai To quickly begins to guzzle it down. Growing impatient, Brass Head attacks Hai To, who parries the attack with the wine jug, causing it to shatter against Brass Head's metal headdress, which is covered with a cloth one to hide it.Seemingly more annoyed at the wine jug being wasted, than anything else, Hai To nonetheless reveals Brass Head and Silver Spear for who they really are. Silver Spear, not recognizing Hai To but seeing that he is exceptionally skilled in combat, condescendingly offers him a place among the Che Sa gang. But Hai To presents some outrageous conditions, among them his being the Number 1 Chief and that all the grunts must be done away with. He starts to recite a third condition, but can't seem to remember what it is. Knowing he is simply taunting them, the remaining grunts attack Hai To, but he kills one and escapes from the others.On the road, Leng is begging Li to rest while she finds a doctor to help him. But Li refuses the offer. He says his internal body control can fend off the Sand Palm poison for at least two days, which should be enough time for the mission to be accomplished. Fearful of losing Li, Leng accuses him of only caring about his own heroism, but Li again counters, saying he is willing to die for the sake of both Yang Yu Jun and the famine victims, while Leng wants to save Li only out of her own love for him-- who then, he asks, is being selfish.The whole guard convoy is resting at the town. Several scouts report in to Yang Hu Yun. Many rival gangs know of the gold shipment, but none dare try to steal it because they all know that the Che Sa gang is pursuing it, and the other gangs, being no match for Che Sa, are afraid of trying to compete with them. Yen and Fang also have a prisoner, who they caught loitering around the area where the convoy is resting, and who they suspect of being a Che Sa member. They try to interrogate him, but the loiterer tells them to go ahead and kill him-- he is not afraid, and he knows that torture is against their morale code. Acknowledging that attempting to learn anything would be futile, Fang gives the loiterer a quick and clean death.A secret panel in the floor suddenly opens up and Brass Head emerges, attacking the guard convoy. Yang Hu Yun realizes that the panel conceals a hidden tunnel through which the Che Sa have spirited the gold chests back onto the wagon and are preparing to spirit it away. He orders his men to stop them, but more Che Sa arrive in force, engaging them all in battle. As Brass Head and the Che Sa grunts battle the guard convoy, Iron Robe climbs in the wagon and starts to drive it off. Hai To stealthily stows away on the wagon, clinging to its underside and axles. When Iron Robe is out of both sight and earshot of his reinforcements, Hai To breaks the rear axle of the wagon, bringing it to a standstill. Iron Robe quickly lights a signal flare. Hai To comes out of hiding and casually taunts Iron Robe about nobody answering the signal flare.But one of the Che Sa grunts, back in the town, has seen the flare, and hurries to inform Brass Head. He signals a full retreat, but Yen, Fang, Yang Hu Yun and the remaining guards cut Brass Head off and mortally wound him.The rear door to the meeting place is smashed open; Golden Arm has arrived. Brass Head tells Golden Arm that Iron Robe has driven the gold off, but has just sent up a signal flare. Golden Arm says he will go investigate, and then when the time is right, he will avenge Brass Head, killing all of the guard convoy. Brass Head expresses his gratitude for the promise before he dies.Golden Arm almost casually begins to walk toward the other exit to investigate the signal flare. All of the guard convoy attack him... but fighting unarmed, he fends all of them off, blocking every shot thrown at him; his bare arms stopping the slashes of swords and axes. He reaches the front exit completely unscathed and continues on his way. The guard convoy is in awe of Golden Arm's fighting ability. Yang mentions that Golden Arm never uses weapons, having proven that he does not need any; his arms are the only weapons he needs. He could have killed all of them then and there, but let them go-- for now-- because of the signal flare that Iron Robe sent up.And Iron Robe does have his hands full. He recognizes Hai To for who he is, knowing that only he would behave the way he is. Knowing that Hai To has arranged to catch him alone, he engages the agent in hand to hand combat. A group of Che Sa reinforcements arrive. Making quick work of them, Hai To seizes a spear to use as a weapon, but Iron Robe's metal-studded robe protects him from the spear's sharp point. But Hai To finally outwits Iron Robe, placing the wagon between them. Rather than allow Hai To to try and circle around for a rear attack, Iron Robe leaps over the wagon... but Hai To has gotten right under where he will land, bracing the butt of the spear on the ground with the point up, which gets under the metal-studded robe, dealing the third Che Sa chief a terrible death. Hai To quickly leaves the scene of the battle-- and the wagon-- after finishing Iron Robe and the last of his henchmen.Golden Arm arrives, surveying the scene. Speaking to himself, he knows that Swordsman Li is hurt, and Leng is with them. Yang, Yen and Fang, and the remaining guard convoy grunts, are not a problem. Only Agent Hai To could have caused this much trouble. Nonetheless, Golden Arm is unafraid, and looking forward to fighting him at the right time. Knowing he cannot fix the wagon and take it away on his own, Golden Arm decides to let Yang Yu Hun recover it and keep it a few more days. As Golden Arm walks off, he is unaware of Hai To lurking among the foliage, having eavesdropped on Golden Arm's monologue.Li encounters Silver Spear on the road. The two fight, and Silver Spear twirls his weapon around in a way that causes Li to become dizzy from the Sand Palm poison. Hai To arrives before Silver Spear can finish Li. Hai To and Silver Spear fight it out until Leng arrives, and Hai To warns Silver Spear to retreat, or Leng will be able to help finish him off. Knowing Hai To is right, Silver Spear withdraws. Hai To picks up the unconscious Li and carries him off, Leng following and yelling in protest.Hai To brings Li to a blacksmith forge where some acquaintances of his are working. He pays them some silver and they place Li into the forge, locking him inside. Leng, outraged, tries to attack Hai To, but he fends her off easily, telling her nothing. She is forced to stand outside and wait.The smith workers put more wood into the fire to feed it. Li comes to from the intense heat and tries to break out of the forge, but cannot. His fists hurting from the effort, he screams in anger and anguish.Scouts are reporting in to Yang Hu Yun, who is leading the wagon again. The scouts have checked ahead ten miles and have found a small town where they can rest. Yang Hu Yun agrees, but says the convoy will also rest where they are now, for a while.But this proves a deadly mistake, as the Che Sa have anticipated that the convoy would pass through the area, and have set booby-trap poison needles everywhere. All of the convoy guards who have leaned or sat near trees and bushes are dead. Yen sweeps the ground with his poleaxe and finds a near minefield of poison needles sticking out of the ground. He has everyone break pieces of wood directly off the wagon and nowhere else, to attach to the soles of their shoes. Everyone must move standing completely upright and must touch nothing, and lean against nothing.At the forge, Leng is vowing to exact vengeance on Hai To if it takes the rest of her days, and Hai To, guzzling wine again, simply laughs her off, saying he's right in front of her. Despite her anger, she is no match for him in combat and grows more and more frustrated.Inside the forge, Li has ripped off his tunic and shirt, to find that the intense heat has caused his body to drive out the Sand Palm poison through perspiration. He understands now that he was not placed into the forge to kill him or cremate his body... but to save his life. Hai To signals to the workers to open the forge, and Li emerges, alive and completely healthy again. As Leng marvels at this, Hai To leaves again... without paying the workers. He tells them it was Li they saved, they should hand him the bill.Golden Arm and Silver Spear confer at their headquarters. Silver Spear says that their poison needle traps have decimated a large number of the guard convoy, and when the convoy arrives at the next town to spend the night, the Che Sa will be ready. The convoy has sustained considerable losses, though the ones remaining are the toughest yet.Golden Arm grows thoughtful as he remembers fending off Yang's forces the previous night when Brass Head and Iron Robe were killed. He had had time to observe Yang Hu Yun's fighting style and is sure that he is not a skilled fighter... which makes no sense to Golden Arm because he is famous as a swordsman. A little over a year ago, on a different escort duty, he killed seventeen would-be bandits, using his sword, in a single battle.Silver Spear is unconcerned, feeling that Yang, like the rest of the guard service, will all be slain soon and the Che Sa will have the gold. Golden Arm concedes the point, and asks about rival gangs that might also try to get the gold for themselves. Silver spear says that all the other gangs are too scared of trying to compete against the Che Sa. Only one name is any cause of concern to either Golden Arm or Silver Spear... a fighter named Iron Feet, who was also renowned a short time ago, but simply disappeared shortly after Golden Arm formed the Che Sa gang.The guard convoy has arrived at the next town and is preparing to sleep for the night. It takes very little time before several more of the grunts fall prey to the next Che Sa trap... they have driven off or killed all the town's inhabitants and poisoned the water supply for miles around. They must consume only the food and water rations brought with them from the start, and be doubly alert on guard shifts throughout the night.Hai To arrives, guzzling wine from a jar as he is always doing. He knows the water has been poisoned, so he is fortunate he only drinks wine. He confers with Li and Yang, who understand that even the candles may be poisoned, so they are only using their own torches. But Hai To notes the iron bracket rings placed on the walls for holding the torches. He ushers everyone outside and pulls the windows shut just as the heat from the torches causes the bracket rings to release poison gas. Hai To notes that they will all have to sleep outside tonight, on the very streets of the town.Later at night, the Wang Brothers, two of the senior guards in the convoy, decide that they can't stay with the convoy because they're sure to die if they do. They make an agreement to sneak into the building where the gold chests are, steal whatever they can carry, and hurry off. But it turns out that even the chests, themselves, are coated with contact poison, which kills the two guards, and baffles the rest of the convoy, including Yang Hu Yun and even Hai To. The Che Sa couldn't have possibly known that any of the escort convoy was going to turn coat. And even if they somehow could have known, why place poison on the chests? Yang and Hai To wrestle over the possibility of a traitor in the escort service.The convoy leaves the town at dawn to get on the road. Hai To has already left. Silver Spear and his spearmen find Hai To at another tavern and quickly kill all its employees. Silver Spear tells Hai To that Golden Arm is offering him a deal: if he backs off from the convoy, they'll give him a 20% cut of the gold's value. Instead of answering, Hai To questions Silver Spear on the poisoning of the Wang Brothers. The blank look from Silver Spear, showing he doesn't know what Hai To is talking about, the answer Hai To expected.Silver Spear tells Hai To that if he doesn't accept Golden Arm's terms, then Golden Arm wants to settle with him, hand to hand, in a duel. Hai To asks for the time and place, and seems remarkably unconcerned. Silver Spear withdraws, but Hai To tells the spearmen grunts that they are under arrest, and kills them all.On the road, fear of the Che Sa has broken the morale of all the remaining convoy grunts. They approach Yang Hu Yun and tell him that they want to leave. Yang starts to pull his sword, but Li says to let them go. If they wish to run like cowards, it will catch up to them in time. The grunts are hurry off, and Li, Yen, and Fang are thoughtful. They understand the grunts losing morale, as all their co-workers and friends are dead. As for the three of them... their loyalty is to Yang, to the end.Yen and Fang go ahead on the road to scout, leaving Yang, Li and Leng with the wagon. Arriving at a clearing, Yen and Fang are thoughtful. The Che Sa must know that the convoy's strength is nearly broken, and Yen has also seen that Yang is barely competent as a fighter. He and Fang wonder if he is injured, but they are too mindful of his feelings to ask.The ambush that they are expecting strikes at that moment; a contingent of spearmen under Silver Spear. Separating Yen and Fang, Silver Spear takes Yen down with several thrown darts just after Yen finishes off all but one of the spearmen. Fang and Silver Spear fight it out until Silver Spear gets Fang in a grapple and the last spearman skewers Fang from behind. Breaking free of the grapple, Fang swings his axes over his head, killing the spearmen, and then, as Silver Spear is off-guard, Fang grabs the spearhead that is poking through his chest, and with his last breath, pulls the spear completely through his body and drives it into Silver Spear, taking the Che Sa Chief number two, with him.Yang Hu Yun, Li and Leng arrive at the site of the battle. That Yen and Fang managed to kill Silver Spear is small comfort in light of their also being lost. Only Yang, Li, Leng and Hai To remain... and Li thinks poorly of Hai To as an escort member. He stalks off alone, Leng realizing he probably is going to seek out and challenge Golden Arm.Hai To is leaving the tavern, hauling a small wagon loaded with wine jars. He happens across Li and tries to warn him from proceeding where he's headed. Li pays no attention.Hai goes to meet Yang and Leng on the road. Finding out about the loss of Yen and Fang, Hai To says that he was set to meet Golden Arm at Chi Li Hill, but he suspects that Li figured this out and has gone there himself. Leng is outraged that Hai To didn't try to stop Li, even though Hai To points out that if he tried, Li would fought to his own death trying to get through Hai To. Li's sense of duty and honor mean far more to him than anything, including Leng's love for him.Just as both Leng and Hai To predicted, Li finds his way to Chi Li Hill and challenges Golden Arm. The lead Che Sa chief sees no threat in Li, even allowing him to recover his sword after disarming him. Good as Li's swordsmanship is, Golden Arm's unarmed technique is better. The bare skin of his arms does not yield to the razor edges of Li's steel sword. Golden Arm finally tires of the bout and kills Li.Leng arrives in time to see Li struck down. Drawing her own sword, she starts to advance on Golden Arm, but she knows she cannot hope to take him and starts to backpedal when he advances on her in return. Golden Arm gives her three days to leave the area and give up her role in escorting the gold shipment. After that, if he sees her again, she admits defeat.As Golden Arm turns away, Leng notices a bamboo pole poking against her ear; it is Hai To, using the pole to discretely whisper to her without Golden Arm hearing. He tells her to leave the area and return in two hours, whereupon she will be set to take revenge for Li's death.Golden Arm meets up with Hai To. He tells Hai To that his men are giving Li an honorable burial, and that he gave Leng three days to run. Hai To is unafraid of his own death, shrugging it off as a risk of his work.Yang Hu Yun arrives with the gold wagon. He is now alone in escorting it. Seeing Golden Arm, he removes his cloak and draws his sword... in a manner that even Golden Arm, trained only in unarmed fighting technique, can see plainly that Yang barely knows how to use a sword, despite his fame as a swordsman. Hai To tells Golden Arm to forget about Yang. Golden Arm acknowledges and they begin their duel.Hai To and Golden Arm are almost evenly matched. They battle to a stalemate before Yang throws his sword to Hai To, who catches it and resumes the battle without missing a stride. Even Yang's sword has no effect on Golden Arm's arms, and he shatters the sword to pieces between his hands. Finally Hai To produces two metal hooks that prove to be attached to long chains. Getting Golden Arm's arms snared up in them, Hai To suddenly conforts and regurgitates a gullet full of wine, spewing it full force into Golden Arm's unprotected eyes.Golden Arm is blinded by the attack; the one part of his body that Hai To knew had to be vulnerable. With the leader of Che Sa incapacitated, it seems that the gold shipment is safe for the short distance remaining for it to be escorted.But it just seems that way. A man emerges from the interior of the wagon, having been in hiding there from the very beginning. He looks exactly like Yang Hu Yun (also played by Sun Chien) and wields an identical nine-ring broadsword. He strikes from behind, mortally wounding Hai To.Hai To quickly pieces everything together. Yang's double and the true leader of the escort service, is also the traitor from within. He can easily kill Golden Arm, pass him and Hai To off as having killed each other, and then kill his stand-in, and everyone will think that the remaining Che Sa gang members have the gold. Yang stares in horror as his employer gives him a wicked smile, before advancing and killing him with a swift sword-stroke.Hai To points out two weaknesses in the escort leader's plot. First, he didn't know about the contact poison on the chests, so he didn't have to kill the Wang Brothers. Also, his stand-in, although a near perfect resemblance to him, was not a competent swordsman, as the real Yang himself is famed as.But the escort leader says that his swordplay is no better than his stand-in's had been. What he IS extremely skilled at, however... is a fighting style that makes heavy use of kicking techniques. He is extremely good with his feet. The last piece of the puzzle falls into place as he reveals that he is the missing fighter Golden Arm had been concerned about... Yang is Iron Feet.Shortly before Golden Arm formed the Che Sa gang, he and Iron Feet had been equals. But after the gang was assembled, Iron Feet was sorely outnumbered and could not overcome them. He went into hiding, and began biding his time leading a crew of escort guards, waiting for a major job as this where he could finally see the Che Sa dismantled through attrition, kill Golden Arm, and turn coat, starting his own gang of outlaws. To hide his identity, Iron Feet even established a false reputation as a swordsman; the seventeen men he killed at a lake while on escort duty, died from his kung-fu kicks, and while the bodies were still warm, he then slashed them repeatedly with his sword so it would appear that he killed them with the sword. Nobody survived to tell the truth.To finish his plan, Iron Feet must also kill Golden Arm. Golden Arm knows that Iron Feet has no choice in this. Straining his ears to listen, he is able to fend off Iron Feet's attack and counter effectively. Iron Feet happens to notice Golden Arm's ears twitching, straining to listen. Iron Feet backs off, stepping very slowly and carefully to deaden the sound of his footfalls. This allows him to seize the advantage and land a number of punishing kicks.But before Iron Feet can finish Golden Arm, Hai To suddenly leaps into the fray. Iron Feet's sword slash never actually hurt Hai To... his wine flask stopped the blow. As he's always said, wine is his best friend. Iron Feet and Hai To battle it out until Hai To is able to knock Iron Feet back... right into a waiting Golden Arm, who lands a lethal blow from behind.Golden Arm is still blind, however. He is no longer effective as leader of a criminal gang. Seeing no other option, and in a sign of gratitude for Hai To showing mercy to him, he tells Hai To he will find his way to the next town to live out the rest of his days quietly.But Leng has returned, as Hai To has told her to, and she is ready to take her revenge. Coming up behind Golden Arm, she drives her sword through his back, the point crashing out through his chest. Acting on pure reflex, Golden Arm breaks off the front of Leng's sword, and she is in shock finding the bloody point at her own neck in a heartbeat.But Golden Arm chooses to spare her life. The clean death Leng has given him, in the end, is much better than the fate he had been facing. He tosses the broken piece of her sword aside and accepts his death.Hai To tells Leng that the famine-stricken area is close enough that she can reach it quickly. There are no further obstacles to her bringing the wagon safely there, even if she is alone. Bidding her farewell, he goes off to find more wine and get drunk. Jin Bei Tong closes with that simple note."

Ramprasad is a recent college graduate who finds a job with a finicky man, Bhavani Shankar, who believes that a man without a mustache is a man without a character. Bhavani Shankar is also against any of his employees indulging in recreation of any kind. When Ramprasad's boss catches him at a hockey match, he invents a twin brother, the clean-shaven Laxman Prasad, to save his job. When Bhavani's daughter falls in love with the clean-shaven Laxman Prasad and insists on marrying him, and Bhavani insists she should marry Ramprasad, things take a wacky turn. A fake mother and a hilarious chase are other enjoyable features involved in this comedy.—Vijay Ram Prasad (Amol Palekar), a young chartered accountant, and his sister Ratna are orphans living in Bombay. One morning, an old family friend, Dr. Kedar, visits him with information about a very well-paid job being advertised by Bhavani Shankar (Utpal Dutt), the owner of Urmila Trading Corporation, who happens to be Dr. Kedar's personal friend. Bhavani approves of Ram Prasad Dashrath Prasad Sharma's moustache, oily hair and (short) kurta-pajama, and hires him. Bhavani Shankar is a bit nutty and feels young people should have no interests other than work, so when Ram Prasad wants to watch a hockey test, Ram Prasad tells him that his mother is sick to get leave. Of course, Bhavani goes to the same hockey test and spots Ram Prasad. When confronted at work, Ram Prasad tells him that he has a twin, who is good-for-nothing, who wears loud clothes and is clean-shaven and westernized.

He and his sister Ratna (Manju Singh) have no relatives or acquaintances except Dr. Kedar (David). Dr. Kedar tells him about Bhavani Shankar's (Utpal Dutt) firm known as Urmila Traders. Ramprasad is shown to possess many qualities. He is very good in accounting, is fond of sports and music, is a very good singer and also a very good actor (which he uses to get the job at Shankar's office).Shankar is a man of traditional values: He hates youth wearing modern clothes. He is a sports fan, but thinks lowly of youth knowing anything about sports. But his weirdest trait is hatred towards men without mustaches. He thinks they are characterless.Ramprasad has a mustache. He takes care of other problems by wearing a kurta and feigning ignorance about sports. Bhavani hires him immediately. Ram is a hardworking guy, so Bhavani (and Ram) have no problems. However, one day Ram takes leave by pretending that his mother (who died many years ago) has taken ill and goes to watch a hockey match. Bhavani Shankar, who attends the match, sees him there.The next day Bhavani summons Ramprasad to his office and asks him about the hockey match. Remembering the plot of a movie a friend of his is shooting, Ram convinces Bhavani Shankar that he had seen his ""mustache-less"" identical twin Lucky (alias Lakshmanprasad Dashrathprasad Sharma) at the stadium.Bhavani Shankar buys his argument and feels bad about accusing him. He makes amends by hiring Lucky to teach his daughter Urmila (Bindiya Goswami) music. Ramprasad reluctantly shaves his mustache to become Lucky and starts to teach Urmila. He is helped by his actor friend Deven Verma (playing himself).Urmila (aka Urmi) is the exact opposite of her father. She takes an immediate liking to Lucky, while Ram is barely noticed by her. Bhavani notices this and gives Ram another job to tutor on the pretext of her exams. Meanwhile, Mrs. Srivastav (Dina Pathak), a socialite, is roped to play the part of Ram, ""Lakshman"" and Ratna's mother. Like Ram, she also ends up playing her own twin in front of Bhavani.Ram tells Urmila the truth. Urmila tells him to tell the truth to Bhavani as well.

The summary has covered everything worth knowing including how the story ends. How such a summary got by imdb review is quite a mystery since no one I know can quite get away with pulling that off. I am now going to add some lines to fill out the synopsis to the required ten lines demanded by imdb, because as I've already mentioned, the plot summary has indeed told us everything and there's nothing of significant importance to add.
I counted the lines that I wrote which totaled eleven on the page I was given to write a detailed synopsis, but a preview of the page triggered an error message indicating I hadn't yet written 10 lines???
So, once again, since the plot summary covered the entire story board, including the ending and even spoilers, anyone can see there's not much left to include in a synopsis, and filling in even ten lines seems rather ludicrous...
Not leaving me anything of significance to write a synopsis with is hardly my fault and would not constitute a justifiable reason for losing the privilege of writing or editing a future synopsis."

Reporter Moses Brody receives a phone-call from his ex-wife, a fellow reporter, who says he has a big story in the Antilles. When he arrives, she has been killed. While investigating her death, he comes across the case she was working on: a crashed Concorde airliner, sabotaged by an airline company whose South American business is jeopardized by the new Concorde airplanes. He digs deeper and finds that the stewardess survived the crash into the ocean, but she is being held by criminals who are blackmailing the company responsible for the crash. The crash site is kept hidden, however, and the authorities don't believe his story without the proper evidence. On his own, Brody attempts to rescue the stewardess from her captors, and while doing so, he discovers that another Concorde flight out of London has been sabotaged to crash in the same way. The two race against the clock to get the information to London and prevent the crash.—Helltopay27 Concorde Test Flight 820 is sabotaged which forces the plane to crash land in the ocean off coast of Martinique in the Antillies of the Caribbean. The only survivor is a Jean Beneyton (Mimsy Farmer), a French hostess on the flight. Two fishermen find her, but then are soon killed off by a group of suited corporate agents who ride out in a speedboat, because they were witnesses to the crash.In New York City, an investigative reporter, Moses Brody (James Franciscus), receives a phone call from his ex-wife Nicole (Mag Fleming), who runs a local restaurant in Martinique, who tells him about an ""important story"". But upon arrival in Martinique, Brody learns that Nicole has died from an apparent ""heart attack"". Brody is devastated. Later that evening, while wondering the streets of the town, Brody is attacked by a gang of thugs, but is rescued by a mysterious local man named George, who owns a fishing trawler and tells him that Nicole was a friend of his and she was killed because she knew that the crashed Concord flight landed on a reef nearby and the two of them decide to investigate.Meanwhile, a shady businessman named Milland (Joseph Cotton) and his business partner Danker (Edmund Purdom) learn about the Concord crash and after consulting with their associate, Martinez, plot to cover up any evidence involved with the crash. It becomes apparent that Milland and Danker are behind the events.Brody and George are in a boat when they see Jean Beneyton jump off of the henchmen's boat and attempts to swim away before she is recaptured. Later, they arrive at the crash site and after donning scuba gear they find the wreck of the Concorde submerged under 100 feet of water in the Caribbean. While Brody goes inside the wreck, George gets his arm stuck in a jagged part of machinery and Brody has to amputate George's left arm to free him. Moses discovers explosive charges on the downed plane which were planted earlier by Milland's henchmen to destroy any evidence of foul play.Upon surfacing, George gets hit in the goggles by a bullet as several henchmen in a speedboat appear and attack. Brody is forced to go back down under the water with two scuba men in chase. Brody outwits them by hiding in a underwater cave in which he goes back to the surface and pulls out the henchman who remained behind in the speedboat and steals it.Brody then goes to the United States Consul of Martinique, and wants to start an investigation. He then takes them to the site and finds nothing. They call off the search for the missing Concorde. Brody then says that he saw Jean on a yacht. The Consul then says that if he knew it was Brody, he would have gotten him off the case as Brody was reporting a scandal concerning a Congressman.Meanwhile, Milland and his men watch a video as the submerged Concorde explodes. They then find out that Jean is alive and being held for a $1 million ransom by the very same thugs they hired to abduct her.At the same time, another Air France Concorde plane lands in Rio De Janeiro, Brazil which prepares itself for a flight from Venezuela to London.That evening, Brody sneaks on-board the henchmen boat where he overhears them saying that they want to get rid of Jean and also overhears them talking about their superiors taking down a second Concord flight. Brody rescues her and they escape from the boat.After reaching the shore, Brody tries talking to Jean about the crash, but she is so shaken by the traumatic experience that she she can't remember very much. In the morning, they hitch a ride on a banana truck driven by a local farmer. But soon Milland's henchmen, led by Forsythe (Venantino Venantini) find Brody and Jean again and give chase, but they are cut off by a construction vehicle.On board the airborne second Concorde, Flight 128, a crew member turns on one of the inboard engines on the plane. Up in the cockpit, the pilot Captain Scott (Van Johnson) discovers something which same thing happened as with the first attack: loss of power. This is because a henchman puts vials of acid in the food of the flight which breaks upon being heated up and and acid breaks through the microwave ovens and severs the electrical lines in the cabin.In Martinique, Brody calls the Consul and has Jean begin to tell her story about it, but they are cut off as the henchmen are back. As the Consul calls up his associates in London with his ideas to what might be happening, the chase continues. The Concorde then loses radio contact with London control, and the cabin lights begin to flicker. Captain Scott soon regains contact with London, who suggests they run a circuit control. The London air traffic chief controller (Robert Kerman) also gets a call from Jean. The controller then reports they can't reach the Concorde. On board the plane, the navigator (Roberto Santi) then reports that pressure in the main cabin is dropping.On the ground, Jean contacts the American Consul at a bank, but Forsythe and his henchmen arrive again, and she and Brody have to run. This time, the police are there and enter a shootout with the men in which all of the henchmen are killed.Meanwhile, London Air Traffic Control gets radio contact with the Concorde on a VHF frequency. Captain Scott on the Concorde then descends the aircraft to a lower altitude below 12,000 feet, but London now can't get Concorde on the VHF frequency, either. Brody and Jean reach the American Consul and she begins describing what happened.The Concorde banks and the number one engine overheats. London control reports that the crash began with overheating of the oven. The crew discovers the number one engine is now on fire, and they quickly extinguish it. The Concorde continues its descent, as one passenger becomes hysterical.The plane then levels out at 9,000 feet. London control can now see them on radar, and proceed to clear a runway. Concorde then makes a beautiful landing. Brody is relieved.The next day, Milland talks with Danker about the events and has a newspaper with the headline ""Concorde Passengers Saved by Journalist"". They talk about their next move and what to do about Brody.In Martinique, Jean thinks that Brody will get a big welcome in New York. Brody jokingly states that he doesn't have to go, and they laugh. He says he has to pay a visit ""to a certain big shot"". Jean then gets on an Air France flight to return to Paris, but before she leaves he says he'll give her a call.Brody then calls his friend, Alfie, and says that he wants to ""push a certain Humpty Dumpty"" off his wall. He says he wants to know the heads of the top corporations in New York City (Milland included), whom are heavily involved in aircraft sales to South American countries, specifically those most hurt by competition from Concorde. Brody then vows to find any evidence against Milland and to bring him down for arranging this whole thing."

With him all set to clear his sentence, Natwar will now have to deal with the angry villagers, the man-eating tiger and will now come up front with his past none other than Vikram who now have a different agenda of seizing a mine full of diamonds.—gavin (racktoo@hotmail.com) Natwar (Amitabh Bachchan) is a young boy, when his beloved older brother and caretaker, police officer Gridharilal (Ajit Khan), is framed for bribery by sinister criminal mastermind Vikram (Amjad Khan). Gridharilal is tried in court, and this has an adverse impact on Natwar as he cant figure out why his honest brother has been meted out this treatment by the government. Girdharilal continues his efforts and finds the locations of Vikram's hidden warehouses. This helps Girdhari to clear his name and to be re-instated in police.
But Vikram attacks Girdhari's family and injures his wife, so that she loses her unborn child in the attack. she and Girdhari think of Natwar as their own son. But Natwar is now changed and doesn't think of honesty as the best policy.When he grows up, Natwar (Amitabh Bachchan) creates a secret identity for himself, posing as a powerful and mysterious underworld figure named Mr. Natwarlal, & determined to slowly but surely exact vengeance on Vikram. As Natwarlal, Natwar robs the thieves of the country by knowing their dirty secrets and then distributes the robbed money into the poor as a rural Robin Hood. He tells at home that he is a successful businessman and hence has so much money.Gridharilal does not understand his motives and develops a grudge against him. Natwar learns from Mickey, an infamous underworld figure and Vikram's former ally, who is posing as a burnt man, that Vikram is in a village called Chandanpur and wants a diamond necklace, which is in the possession of Fakirchand. Mickey wants Natwar to steal the necklace and take it to Chandanpur where he will find Vikram to complete his revenge. Unknown to Natwar, Mickey is using Natwar to penetrate Vikram'e defenses in Chandanpur as Mickey and Vikram are now rivals.
Natwar steals the necklace, unknown to everyone present there and leaves for Chandanpur, after apologizing to an asleep Gridharilal about the troubles he has given to him. Meanwhile Mickey's plan is in action and he wants control over the diamond mines that Vikram operates in Chandanpur. He plans to eliminate both Natwar and Vikram, when Natwar has done his job. Mickey is pissed at Vikram for branding him with a hot iron, which is how each of his is slave is branded in the mine.He reveals that Vikram is terrorizing the villagers using a tiger. In the guise of a tiger attack, Vikram kidnaps 1 or 2 villagers at a time and makes them slaves in his mines. Mukhiya (Kader Khan) is the elder of the village and Shanno (Rekha) his daughter.
Meanwhile, Natwar arrives at Chandanpur, disguised as Avtaar Singh, a hunter whom Vikram had already killed (but this was not known to the villagers). Mukhiya and Shanno welcome Avtaar with open arms as they believe he will rescue them from the tiger. Natwar realizes that he came for a different mission but is now entangled in something else entirely.
The first time the tiger attacks (Chandanpur is on a hill), Natwar accidentally knocks over empty barrels which roll down the hill and scare the tiger away. The villagers are happy and grateful.Vikram is intrigued by this mystery man, but doesn't kill him as he doesn't want BSF or Police to descend on his operations if this man was mixed up with them. Meanwhile Shanno falls in love with Natwar. The next time tiger attacks, he goes for Shanno and Natwar plays on his life to protect Shanno and the villagers. The tiger retreats.
Vikram gets word that BSF will not patrol Chandanpur area for another 4 months. So he attacks all villages to gather slaves for his mines. Natwar is alert to the danger and senses another tiger attack on Chandanpur (he put 2 and 2 together to figure out that the tiger attacks are orchestrated by Vikram). Natwar and Shanno wrestle the tiger and villagers pitch in to capture it.
Vikram sends an assassin to kill Natwar, but Mukhiya sacrifices himself to save Natwar and Natwar chases and kills the assassin. Mukhiya leaves the village under Natwar's protection before dying. Vikram's men attack, but Natwar defends the village and the attackers retreat.Natwar anticipates another attack and fortifies the village's defenses by moving rocks, supplies and the captured tiger up the hill. Vikram's men attack again, but this time the villagers are prepared and throw rocks at them from a height and force them to retreat. This time Natwar goes after the attackers and finds Vikram's mines. He leaves a message for Vikram on his tape recorder, declaring he is Girdhari's brother. To lure Vikram out, Natwar steals all the diamonds his mines had produced
Vikram orders his mean to penetrate the hill and throw down the villagers food stocks. and then Vikram's army surrounds the hill.
Meanwhile Girdhari arrests Mickey in the city and shoots him when he tries to escape. Mickey's last word are misinterpreted by Girdhari to think that Natwar is running an illegal diamond mine in Chandanpur.
Back in Chandanpur Natwar releases the tiger who attacks Vikram's men. By the time they recover the villagers descend and take away the food back up the hill. As a last trump card, Vikram parades all captured villagers in front of the villagers on the hill. People cant resist looking at their lost loved ones and run towards them, only to be captured by Vikram's men.Meanwhile Girdhari reaches Chandanpur and starts a search operation of the hills with BSF. They will soon find the mine and Vikram. So Vikram rigs the mine with explosives and escapes (after he has captured Girdhari and the BSF commander). The explosives are pressure sensitive. Now Girdhari realizes that Natwar was trying to help the villagers. Natwar outsmarts Vikram by walking in his footsteps (to avoid the pressure sensitive explosives) and disarming the switch. Natwar then goes after Vikram and defeats him in hand to hand combat. Vikram is killed by Natwar when he tries to attack Shanno."

Soon the courageous girl's condition takes a downturn, and the physician must carefully, even agonizingly, weigh the consequences of keeping a promise she made to Buffy. In part as an escape from a divorce, the twelve year marriage which ended up not being anything she envisioned, Dr. Alexandra Kendall moves to West Hartford, Connecticut to accept a position working at a medical clinic under its head physician, Dr. Walter McInerny. She has decided to throw herself into work in not being emotionally ready to deal with the personal side of her life. While Dr. McInerny is away, Alexandra, in an emergency, sees who would be considered one of his patients, seventeen year old Elizabeth Koenig - Buffy to her friends - who broke her leg in a soccer incident. Believing the break inconsistent with the nature of the incident, Alexandra decides to dig deeper and discovers that the break was a manifestation of tumor in her leg, the biopsy confirming it malignant which leads to an immediate amputation of said leg above the knee. After Buffy overcomes the initial grief of losing her leg, she, through her parents, Bud and Fran Koenig, requests that Alexandra remain her primary physician for this situation, her prognosis immediately following the amputation uncertain. Dr. McInerny agrees with the change seeing what Buffy needs is more a comforting presence than a doctor. Buffy's parents, while not fully seeing Alexandra as a qualified physician, also went along with Buffy's request in seeing in Alexandra that young woman who will respect their want solely to provide Buffy with ""happy thoughts"" and not medical diagnoses. Alexandra gets caught in the middle as Buffy herself wants Alexandra to let her know of anything to do with her diagnosis and prognosis as soon as she herself knows. As Alexandra and Buffy negotiate and renegotiate their relationship, they each deal with their own personal lives, Buffy especially with regard to the relationship with her boyfriend, Gerry Hulin, and Alexandra if she will allow herself to open up again to the possibility of romance, this time in the form of radiologist, Dr. Jim Sandman.

Her boyfriend Gerry is a football player at Hall High. While Dr. McInterny is away on vacation, longtime patient Buffy hurts her leg while harmlessly kicking a soccer ball during Gerry's nearby football practice. At the hospital, Dr. Kendall finds that not only is the leg broken, but the bone was also weakened by cancer. Dr. Kendall treats Buffy and the two develop a bond that extends beyond the doctor-patient relationship; Dr. Kendall is drawn to Buffy's humor and raw honesty. As Buffy's health deteriorates, she pushes her friends away. She pushes loyal Gerry away. Buffy insists on full disclosure from Dr. Kendall regarding the true nature of her condition and prognosis. Buffy's parents, Fran and Bud Koenig, oppose such disclosure for their little girl. Dr. Kendall's professional ethics are challenged and she has to decide between the strict professionalism advocated by Dr. McInterny and the promise she has made to her young, new friend."

Eloísa le dice que no se pase, que le está haciendo daño, a lo que Bernardo responde que debería vigilarolo más y no dejarlo salir de la casa. Eloísa bate la comida y también le pone la comida al perro, y deja todos los cacharros en el fregadero para fregar más tarde. Mientras los perros comen, Eloísa se corta las uñas de los pies y se pinta las uñas; Bernardo toca el piano y se pone una de las cremas del perro en el pie. a Eloísa eso le parece asqueroso, pero él le dice que si a Dany le viene bien, a él también le funcionará.Más tarde, con todo desordenado, Dany se pone a alisquear la ropa interior usada de Eloísa.

Eloísa estaría encantada de contribuir al proyecto, pero no tiene dinero. El veterinario, el doctor Alberto Agal (Cruz Tobar) pregunta a Eloísa por la salud de Dany, y le recomienda que le haga comer verduras, pero ella dice que no las traga.De regreso a casa, Eloísa y Bernardo tienen una bronca, porque ella les daría dinero para que llevasen a cabo el proyecto si lo tuviese, mientras que Bernardo piensa que todo son tonterías. En la bronca, se deduce que no son un matrimonio, sino hermanos, - nacidos de la misma madre. Bernardo se cabrea tanto que decide andar el resto del camino, a pesar del frío. Ve unos perros en una casa que le gruñen, y él se entretiene chasqueándoles los dedos, hasta que la gente de la casa se despierta y va a ver que pasa. Por el camino también se encuentra a unos perros abandonados que están comiendo los restos de la basura; improvisa un collar a uno de ellos y se lo lleva. Mientras Eloísa ya está en casa, calmando a Dany porque una tormenta ha estallado, Bernardo vuelve andando y se va empapando. Desde su ventana, Eloísa ve a Bernardo - que se protege con un plástico - y al nuevo perro. Bernardo tiene que tirar de él para hacerle andar. Se oye ladrar al nuevo perro, pero no se ve qué pasa. Mientras tanto, Eloísa se unta miel en su sexo y atrae a Dany hacia ella.Más tarde, Bernardo bebe, ya sin que se vea al nuevo perro, y mientras tanto, Eloísa está sientiendo placer sexual por las caricias de Dany, supuestamente al lamerle la miel. Bernardo oye sus gemidos y se mete en la habitación de al lado. Dany duerme con Eloísa, que lo abraza.Al día siguiente, Bernardo toca el piano mientras Eloísa le corta las uñas a Dany. Operan a la tía Lina de urgencia, aunque es difícil saber si se salvará. A Eloísa le asustan los cambios, pero su hermano sólo se preocupa de donde van a ir a cenar.Bernardo va a buscar a otro perro a un criadero o a la perrera municipal. Escoge lo que parece un mastín negro, y lo encierra en el maletero.Corte a un sacerdote (Buenaventura Martínez), que está bendiciendo al cuerpo de Lina, ya en un ataud. Durante la bendición, se oye los gemiditos que lanza Dany, a quien Eloísa ha colado en la iglesia metido en un bolso de mano.El agua de la piscina parece ahora más limpia; las cacerolas roñosas han dejado sitio a una olla exprés reluciente; la batidora es nueva y moderna; todo parece más limpio; la montaña de platos nuevos y relucientes, de porcelana, antes no estaba; Bernardo viste con un conjunto de pantalones cortos de tenis nuevos; hasta hay más cantidad de carne para Dany: se nota que han cobrado la herencia de la tía Lina. Vestida con un traje más elegante, Eloísa se mete en un coche recién comprado con elevalunas eléctrico. Eloísa deja a Dany sujeto a un palo en el jardín para que el cesped amortigüe el dolor de las patitas. Dany mete el perro dentro de la casa, donde se le escapa, ante la mirada del nuevo criado de la casa. Mientras va a buscarlo, Bernardo dice que a Dany no le gusta quedarse a solas con él.Como Bernardo tiene ahora su propio coche nuevo, coge a Dany y se van los dos. Sin embargo, le chilla, gritando que antes él estaba mejor y más cómodo. Bernardo dice que él también quiere a Eloísa, pero que ella lo prefiere a Dany. Tanto él como su hermana han ido a buscar más perros. Un domesticador alemán (Werner Delil) enseña lo muy educados que están sus perros. Carmen (Marta Molins) le prepara tres cachorros a Eloísa, mientras que su empleado (Francisco Rodríguez) se pregunta qué demonios hacen con tantos perros. La señora Carmen le dice que no haga preguntas.Eloísa lleva a los cachorritos a la cocina: dice a su hermano que no quiere perros de la perrera porque podrían pasarles cualquier enfermedad. Bernardo se ha comprado una caja de ritmos en lugar del viejo piano. Se supone que Eloísa mata y cocina a los perros. Esa tarde-noche, Alberto viene a cenar con ellos, invitado, y dice que Eloísa cada vez cocina mejor. Dany come con ellos a la mesa. Alberto les explica cómo va el proyecto en el que han invertido tanto dinero, pero Bernardo se levanta, diciendo que no tiene apetito y que no se encuentra bien. Ahora tienen hasta un pequeño cien en casa, y la nevera vuelve a estar abarrotada de carne cruda. Mientras los demás se quedan ablando en la sobremesa, Bernardo sale en la noche a la perrera a coger algún perro, y de hecho vuelve con un perro nuevo a casa.Al llegar, ve a Eloísa ofreciéndose a Alberto, y a éste meterle mano a ella, que al finay al cabo está mucho más arreglada y mejor vestida. Alberto se va, quedando con ellos al día siguiente a las 11 de la mañana. Después, los hermanos discuten. Eloísa quiere hacer una visita de obras con Alberto, pero Bernardo, cada vez bebiendo más, se niega a ir. Bernardo destroza un pastel de bodas sin empezar que había en la casa - ni idea de por qué - y luego se va a vomitar al jardín, ahora mucho más arreglado y el césped igualadísimo. Eloísa se toma una pastilla para dormir y obliga a Dany a tomar otra.Eloísa y Alberto visitan el cementerio de perros. Los ejecutivos son también amables con ella al saber que es una de las accionistas. Alberto le regala la tumba para Dany en el futuro. Bernardo no se comunica con nadie, enfurruñado.

Alberto recomienda a Eloísa que se separe un poco de él cuando ella le dice que está celoso de él y del perro.Bernardo se ha ido y está acariciando a un perro. Cuando su hermana llega a casa, como de costumbre él no oye como lo llama. Su hermana entra y lo descubre penetrando sexualmente al perro, al que le ha atado las patas. A pesar de los gritos de su hermana, no pasa, así que ella acaba golpeándole con un palo. Se caen los dos al suelo y él parece desmayarse. Eloísa llora sobre su pecho y le dice que no pueden seguir así. Poco a poco, él parece reaccionar. Sin embargo, sigue teniendo temblores, o un ataque de algún tipo. Eloísa le da una de sus pastillas a su hermano, pero éste no quiere tomarla; tampoco quiere ver a Dany, lo que aún hace llorar más a Eloísa. Esa noche, Eloísa duerme en un sofá con el caniche en sus rodillas.Esa noche, Bernardo se levanta y le mete la cabeza entre las piernas a Eloísa. Cuando ella se despierta, a él le da otro ataque. Al final, ella llama a Alberto, pero no está en casa. Sin embargo, Bernardo da andado por su propio pie, aunque en un estado febril. Acorrala a Dany en la cocina, y cuando la dueña lo busca, lo encuentra aterrorizado, escondido en un rincón. Bernardo anda como sonámbulo por el jardín de la casa, mientras que Dani se queda encerrado en el baño y con la bañera echando agua. Bernardo se dedica a jugar al escondite y Dany intenta buscar una salida, ya que Eloísa lo ha dejado encerrado en el baño. El perro grande ladra, lo que atrae la atención de Eloísa. Febrilmente, Bernardo se está comportando con un perro, pero cuando su hermana se le acerca, intenta tener relaciones sexuales con ella. Ella llora, aunque hay momentos en que llama por su nombre a su hermano, y otras, a su perro.El caniche sigue dando vueltas y vueltas intentando salir. El teléfono suena, pero entre los ladridos del perro, la bomba del agua, ni Bernardo ni Eloísa lo oyen. Él la penetra por detrás.Al día siguiente, muy de mañana, Alberto se decide a visitarlos. Nadie le abre la verja, ´pero se oyen los ladridos del perro grande a lo lejos, así que se la salta y entra en la casa. Abre la puerta a Dany, que sale corriendo de la casa y su finca. Guiado por los ladridos del perro grande, aún atado a una estantería, Alberto se encuentra a los dos hermanos dormidos uno al lado del otro, alla medio desnuda. Hay sangre por todas partes, y ella parece muerta. El perro grande sigue ladrando.Alberto sale de la casa, se mete en el coche y se va.Primer plando de la piscina, ahora relucientemente limpia, y del cielo azul.Tráfico en una calle de Madrid. Dany baja corriendo un montón de escaleras. Se mete entre el tráfico y la gente, llegando a ocasionar un accidente. Es un día lluvioso. Dos señoras (Asunción ruiz y Natalia soler-Nou) mayores recogen a Dany y se lo llevan, probablemente a casa.--- resumen hecho por KrystelClaire"

Ye Sha captures one of Nezha's friends as he is bathing by the ocean, and Nezha confronts him, injuring him badly. Ao Guang sends his third son, Ao Bing, next. Ao Bing is killed by Nezha, infuriating Ao Guang.A variety of confrontations ensue between Nezha and Ao Guang. Ao Guang and the other Dragon Kings wreak havoc on the people, causing storms, floods and all manners of natural disasters. Seeing this, Nezha takes his father's sword, tells his parents that he is returning their flesh and bones to them, and calls out for his master before committing suicide by slitting his throat.He is reborn with the help of his master, again from a lotus blossom, and is given new weapons and abilities. After breaking into Ao Guang's underwater palace, he confronts Ao Guang and the other Dragon Kings again, and is finally triumphant."

Sam Kellog is a modern-day bounty hunter in Los Angeles who decides to track down Victor Hale, a vicious, heavy-set ex-convict with a $20,000 bounty on his head, who is killing former prison guards with a leather-laced steel glove in revenge for them beating him with the same instrument while he was imprisoned.—matt-282 Victor Hale (Rosey Grier), an African American ex-convict, dresses in black clothing, then dons a motorcycle helmet and a black ""riot"" glove. Later, outside prison gates, a guard (Aldo Ray) is picked up by his mistress and they drive to a warehouse for a sexual tryst. Victor follows them and practically beats the guard to death with his glove.The next day, bounty hunter Sam Kellough (John Saxon) boats through the canals of Venice, California, with his seven-year-old daughter, Lisa (Misty Bruce), who spends weekends with her father. Narrating for the viewers, Sam describes himself as a former minor league baseball player and ex-police officer who gambles too much and struggles to pay his bills. On Monday, he drops Lisa at school, and she tells Sam that her mother will end their weekend visits unless Sam pays his back alimony.Sam's first case is Charles ""Chuck"" Gardener (Nicholas Worth), a bail jumper who wrote bad checks. Sam slips into Chuck's backyard and almost arrests Chuck's boyfriend by mistake. In turn, Chuck attacks Sam, who tosses Chuck into the pool before taking the miscreant into custody. Sam then goes to Bill Schwartz (Keenan Wynn), who runs a bail bonds business, where Sam is paid $300 for capturing Chuck. When Sam asks for the file for ""Cookie,"" a murderer who jumped bail, Bill warns that Cookie is dangerous, but Sam needs the $3,000 bounty. Bill gives him the file, as well as a message to see Lt. Howard Kruger (Howard Honig) at police headquarters.At the police station, Sam pays Kruger 10% of the money he earned for Chuck's capture. Kruger has potentially profitable information for Sam regarding Victor Hale, a musician who was convicted of beating his sister's pimp. After prison, Victor moved to New York City and played in a jazz club, but he got into a fight, was arrested, jumped bail, and returned to Los Angeles. Harry Iverson (Michael Pataki), a bounty hunter from New York, has the bond paperwork and Kruger suggests that Sam team up with Iverson to find Victor. Sam is hesitant until Kruger reveals that Victor has a vendetta against guards, and there is an unofficial $20,000 reward from the prison guards' association. Kruger shows a riot glove, a leather-laced steel glove, to Sam, claiming it was created to handle campus riots in the 1960s, and was also used in the penal system until it was outlawed; Victor was beaten by guards wearing the glove.Pretending to be a newspaper reporter, Sam visits Victor's grandmother (Frances E. Williams) and meets his younger sister, who is brain damaged from her pimp's brutality. Later, Sam stops at a bus station, looking for Mrs. Fitzgerald (Joan Blondell), a 65-year-old bookkeeper on the run for stealing $3,200 from Walter Stratton (Jack Carter), a Realtor. Sam talks Mrs. Fitzgerald into giving him the money and helps her onto a bus, claiming that Stratton does not want to put her in jail. Sam then returns most of the money, but tells Stratton that Mrs. Fitzgerald spent some of it before escaping out of the ladies room. Stratton pays Sam his 20% cut, then introduces his girl friend, Sheila Michaels (Joanna Cassidy), and invites Sam to a poker game the next evening.Later, Sam finds Cookie (Larry Duran) working at a meat packing facility called Apex Meat. The two men fight, and when Cookie attacks with a meat hook, Sam shoots him dead. As the police remove the dead Cookie from the scene, Sam is upset over this since the reward was to bring Cookie in alive and that he might loose his bounty hunter license due to excessive use of force to defend himself, but Lt. Kruger tells him not to worry about the police investigation.The next day, Sam makes copies of Victor's photograph and passes them out on the streets. Meanwhile, in his rundown apartment building where he lives, Victor returns after grocery shopping where he notices a little boy, named Rachman (Shane Mooney), lurking on the stairs. Victor invites the little boy to his apartment, and teaches him to play his guitar.Elsewhere, Sam gets a message from his answering service that Sheila will pick him up for the poker game. When Sam arrives home at his apartment, he receives a telephone call from Victor who has discovered that Sam is pursuing him. As Sam records their conversation, Victor claims he is leaving town in 36 hours and demands to be left alone, but Sam insists he needs the $20,000 reward. Sheila arrives as Victor hangs up. She flirts with him but admits she will not jeopardize her relationship with the wealthy Stratton. She does, however, give Sam a list with ""helpful"" information on the other poker players, promising it will bring him good luck.During the poker game, Sam realizes Sheila's list is spurious, but continues playing until he loses all of his money. As he leaves, Sam tosses the list at Sheila. She insists the ruse was nothing personal, and that Stratton promised her a fur coat to for setting Sam up. Sam returns home to find Iverson awaiting him. Although Sam works alone and does not need Iverson's paperwork to claim the reward money, they negotiate a deal where Sam will retain 70% of the reward.Meanwhile, Victor sneaks into another guard's house and brutally beats the man to death in his bathroom.The next day, Sam waits for Sheila outside her tennis club and they share a romantic picnic. Sam wonders what will happen when Stratton wants a different girl friend, but Sheila claims that she can easily find another wealthy companion. They return to Sam's home and find it has been burglarized. An African American man has been beaten and tied to a chair, with a note reading ""Victor was here."" After the police leave, Sam plays the recorded message for Sheila. Sam listens carefully to background noise and realizes Victor called from a jazz club. Sheila demands to leave, insisting their relationship is finished. Sam drops Sheila at her car, then searches jazz clubs, not realizing that Iverson is following him.At one nightclub, Sam is held up by the doorman until Victor is tipped off to his presence and leaves. On his car telephone, Sam receives a call from Victor, who asks for a meeting. Sam arrives at Victor's apartment building, loads his gun, and climbs to the roof where Victor plays guitar. Sam insists that he is going to take Victor into custody, but Victor claims his friends in the building will kill Sam first then let that happen. Victor pulls out the glove and tells Sam about receiving beatings from the guards. Asking Sam to put away the gun and fight him, Victor gives his opponent the glove to make it a fair fight. A climatic fist-fight happens all over the roof of the building as both Sam and Victor trade blows with each other. However, even with the glove, Sam is still no match for the hulking Victor and decides that the bounty is not worth it. They stop fighting and laugh. As they head for the stairwell, Victor announces he is moving to New Orleans, Louisiana, to make music. However, when Victor opens the door, Iverson shoots him to death. Iverson knocks Sam aside, informing him that the guards wanted Victor dead. Rachman runs upstairs and jumps on Iverson, who tosses the boy aside. Other African American tenants surround Iverson and literally beat him to death and withdraw, leaving Sam behind still on the deck of the roof.In a final voice-over narration, Sam explains that he never less received the entire $20,000 reward, paid off all his gambling debts and alimony bills, and retained visitation privileges with Lisa, but in the final shot, as Sam rows his boat through the Venice canals with his daughter, he wonders if anything worthwhile lasts."

He is constantly bothered by his sister and brother-in-law (Anwar Hussain) (who was himself brought up by a stepmother), who want him to remarry - if not for his sake, then for the sake of his young daughter who needs the love of a mother.Amar having had enough reluctantly agrees to marry. They scout for potential wives, and decide to choose between two sisters-Shobha (Madhu Malini), and Sheela (Meena T.) who reside in Bombay. Since Amar has never met either of them, he is not sure if they will be the appropriate choice. In order to test them, when he visits them in Bombay - he decides to swap places with his servant Dayal.The party (Amar, Aarti and Dayal) arrive at the prospective-in-laws house, which features Durga (Lalita Pawar), as the arrogant and abusive prospective mother-in-law and her weak and helpless husband Shanti Swarup (Manmohan Krishna) and father of the two daughters.
Shobha is dumb, while Sheela is a dancer, but doesn't like a groom who has a kid from the first marriage.Dayal (as Amar) is given a spacious room, and Amar (as Dayal) is settled into the servant's quarters, which consists of an untidy room with no electricity. Soon, Amar (the real one) realizes that he is in fact attracted to Geeta, played by Jaya Bhaduri, (the household servant). Geeta is an orphan who works in the house, and is mistreated by everyone except Shanti Swarup.
Geeta sees that Aarti is very attached to Amar (as Dayal).. Amar (as Dayal) tells her that he considers Aarti as his own daughter and seeks a wife who will also treat her like a mother.
The cooks (Shibban and Bansi) of the house befriend Amar (As Dayal). Durga had told the cooks to serve food cooked in oil, but the cooks ignore her and cook it in ghee. They inform Amar (As Dayal) that the whole house is full of deceptions. Shanti Swarup has no say and Durga runs the show.Shibban befriends Dayal (As Amar), who tells Shibban to go on strike to demand a pay rise from Durga, who has always refused it in the past and only pays them rs 50.

She asks Dayal (As Amar) to deploy Amar (as Dayal) as the cook for the house. soon, Geeta realizes that Amar (as Dayal) cant cook and bails him out by helping to cook.
When Dayal (As Amar) finds out, he goes rushing to the kitchen to help Amar (as Dayal) in the cooking. But then Durga arrives and starts helping out. Eventually Durga, Shobha and Sheela start working in the kitchen. Amar (as Dayal) has a sick stomach and is ordered out and Geeta helps Dayal (as Amar) to set up his bath.Amar cannot reveal himself and openly propose marriage to her, since he is posing as a servant.

Jaggu (Jalal Agha) is a local grocer who supplies the Durga kitchen and is close to her. Jaggu always flirts with Geeta, which she does not like, but this time Amar (as Dayal) stands up for her and tells Jaggu to keep within his limits.
Amar (As Dayal) figures out that while Shobha likes Dayal (as Amar), but Sheela doesn't. Durga suspects something is wrong & tries to get Aarti to tell the truth, but when Amar (as Dayal) tries to intervene, Durga is offended and slaps him hard.

Jaggu meanwhile speaks to Durga and asks for Geeta's hand in marriage. Durga accepts when she learns that Geeta loves Amar (as Dayal). Geeta decides to leave the house, but Durga is adamant that Geeta's mother left her in her care and as such it is Durga's right to marry her away to whomever she sees fit.
Shanti SWarup asks Amar (as Dayal) to get Geeta back. He tells Amar (as Dayal) that Geeta is not a servant, but the daughter of Durga's friend. Geeta lost both her parents as a kid and Durga promised to bring her up as her own child. But over years, Durga treated Geeta only like a servant.Amar (as Dayal) catches up to Geeta and requests her to stop for Aarti's sake. Geeta addresses Amar as Amar and accepts his proposal. Thats when Jaggu shows up with goons. Amar beats them up, which is when police arrives as Durga had complained that Geeta had run away with house servant Dayal

Dracula Blows His Cool,1979,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0079230/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A descendant of the famous vampire gets a job as a photographer shooting beautiful fashion models at the family estate. Being around so much naked and semi-naked flesh has the expected effect on him. Castle van Skrew has seen better days, which is why Stanley [Gianni Garko] has
returned to the old Bavarian homestead, hoping to save it from ruin.
Accompanied by his girlfriend Linda [Linda Grondier], his younger brother Chubby (Leopold
in the German version) [Tobias Meister], and his working staff of models, Stan has opened
the Drop-In Disco and a photography business, Dirty Dozen Pictures, in the
castle. Little does Stan know that, while he is dancing in his disco and
shooting soft core porn photos of tortured women in the dungeon, beneath
them lies his great grandparents, Count Stanislaus Dracula [also Gianni Garko] and Countess
Olivia [Betty Verges]. Stanislaus Dracula and Olivia made a pact years ago to never leave their
crypt, and they have been tended to since then by their faithful renfield
Boris [Ralf Wolter], whose duty it is to steal blood from the local bloodbank so that
Dracula and Olivia can feed. Lately though, their blood supply has been
running short thanks to the village's prim schoolteacher, Ellen Nutcracker [Ellen Umlauf]. Ellen,
who has been proclaiming for years that the castle is inhabited by ghosts
and vampires, saw Boris stealing the blood. She and the school janitor,
Daniel McCleary [Dan van Husen], followed Boris back to the castle, where they peeked in
the window and saw the naked women. When Ellen heard that Stan also opened
a ""dicko,"" she is certain that the castle has become a den of iniquity and
makes it her sworn duty to report this corruption to Burgermeister
Dumphammer [Alexander Grill] and save the virture of the village youth.Meanwhile, Dracula has had it. Tonight's blood supply was nothing
more than a ""mosquito's reserve"" and that infernal racket from the disco
""not only could wake up the dead, it HAS."" He decides to leave the crypt
and see what's going on. While Ellen has a heart-to-heart with Boris over
the stolen blood, and Stan discusses the possibility of opening a hotel
with Italian investor Mario [Giacomo Rizzo], and Mario's hot girlfriend Mousie (Mausi in
the German version) [Bea Fiedler] cools off under the table with Freddie [Herbert Stiny],
Stanislaus Dracula puts the bite on Linda. Also
dissatisfied with her meal, Olivia dons a cape and leaves the crypt. She
comes upon Chubby, but when she bares her fangs, Chubby takes off, falling
into a pond. When Olivia tries to bite him again, Chubby stuffs a fish in
her mouth. Chubby decides to arm himself with garlic, crosses, and stakes
and become a vampire hunter.On a tour of the castle, Ellen notices that a portrait of Count
Stanislaus has been changed for a portrait of King Casimir the Absurd.
When she locates the real portrait, dated 1829-1880, and notices that
Stanislaus looks like Stan, she concludes that Stan is Count Stanislaus
and that he is a vampire. She reveals that she is really Ellen Van
Helsing, daughter of the famous vampire killer, and attempts to repel Stan
with a crucifix, but it doesn't work. That night, when Dracula and Olivia
wake up, Olivia notices that her husband looks revitalized, while he
informs Olivia that she looks like a ""graveyard fishwife."" When Dracula
goes upstairs to the disco, Olivia finds the ladies' room and cleans
herself up. She then seduces Freddie but doesn't drink from him. Instead,
she drinks from Chubby.Meanwhile Stan is away from the castle, negotiating to sell his
photos to Playboy Magazine. When he phones Mario to relay success, Mario
is alarmed because he sees Stanislaus in the disco and assumes he's seeing
a ghost. Just before dawn the next morning, Stan returns to the castle to
find Olivia dancing in the courtyard. Thinking that Stan is Stanislaus,
Olivia comes on to him and asks to be taken down to the crypt. Thinking
that Olivia is just some drunk chick, Stan agrees. Stan is astounded to
see Olivia climb into a crypt and slide the heavy top shut, but before
Stan can figure out what's going on and alert anyone, Ellen and Daniel
knock him in the head with a club. Fortunately, before Ellen can pound a
stake through Stan's heart, Dracula breezes past on his way to his crypt.
Ellen and Daniel skedaddle.At breakfast, Mrs van Skrew (Frau Grafin in the German version) [Herta Worell]
finally spills the family secret about Dracula and Olivia. Mario wants to
destroy the vampires as they are bad for business, but Mrs van Skrew won't
hear of it. Stan comes up with a solution. With Mario's backing, they can
turn the castle into Hotel Dracula, rename the Disco to Disco Dracula, and
advertize the fact that they have real vampires willing and able to bite
any guests who want it. It's a good deal for Dracula and Olivia, too,
because they can have all the blood they want.In fact, Hotel Dracula is so successful that it doesn't take long for
the all-night sucking schedule to wear on Dracula and Olivia such that
they decide to return to Transylvania where they can live out their own
""deaths."" Not to worry about the hotel, though. Dracula has made
arrangements for his successor. From the hotel balcony, Stan and Linda
watch Boris drive off with the Count and Countess. Stan and Linda kiss,
and Linda sinks her fangs into Stan's neck. [Original Synopsis by bj_kuehl.]"

He is going into an Arab Emirate with a chosen group of operatives, and blow up an oil refinery. Getting in is easy, but getting out - well, that's another thing. In the end, among crossfire and grenades, and double-crossing, only Benson comes back to report mission accomplished. he will be gunned down by the Eiffel Tower by his own people. The mission was so secret that someone made sure ""Dead can not speak.""—Artemis-9 A meeting takes place between an emir of an unspecified Middle Eastern nation, and Western diplomats of an unspecified country or countries. The emir presents the edited terms of an agreement he is ready to sign, but has rejected changes to ""Clause Five."" The Westerners refuse unless Clause Five is changed, and the emir storms out without having signed it, telling them they have lost a friend. One Westerner tells another that this was expected, so they will now execute ""Plan One.""Agent Benson arrives in a diplomatic building and receives his orders to execute what may be a suicide mission. If he is caught, he'll get no support from the agency, which he accepts in good nature as standard procedure.He arrives in a Mediterranean city at a hotel and meets agent Lorna. They make love in his room and she says she is angry about being left alone on their previous mission in Paris. A flashback plays in which they arrive Paris and contemplate leaving the agency (still unspecified) in the back of a taxi. But suddenly, their taxi driver pulls a gun and kidnaps them. He takes them under a bridge where he summons other thugs with guns to be taught a lesson by someone Benson has crossed in the past. Benson tells Lorna to run while he manages to subdue all the thugs one by one in a fistfight. Lorna has already run and jumped into the water and swam away, so Benson gets in the taxi and drives off. The flashback ends.Benson and Lorna go back to the hotel lobby and exchange pass phrases with the other agents, Paul, Hanson, and Chris. They set off on a boat ride. Meanwhile, enemy agents pursuing them, wearing white hats and brandishing handguns, show up at the hotel looking for Benson and Lorna, and threaten the hotel staff, who know nothing.On the boat, Lorna jumps into the water and swims to shore at a desert coast. When she gets out, she takes off her wet clothes, exposing her breasts, and runs in her panties up to the rendezvous point with the final member of the team, Louis. Benson explains that this is a tactic to flush out any Arabs who might ambush them, as they wouldn't be able to resist her.Getting the all clear, the other members of the boat rejoin her, and then a group of Arabs with guns shows up and captures the team. A couple members joke that perhaps they could resist Lorna's nude body because they are homosexuals. The team members lash out and fight their captors until they are all knocked unconscious and take their guns. Lorna puts her clothes back on.They meet up with Louis in a desert truck and drive all day towards an oasis. Nearing it, Benson insists they bury their weapons in case they are captured. Some members ask him what their mission is, but he won't say. Once they finish burying their weapons, a group of Bedouin Arabs on horses and camels with guns find them and insist they are trespassing and must be punished. The team insist they are tourists, but the Bedouin do not believe them.The team are taken back to their leader's tent, bound, and the leader is enamored with Lorna. He takes her to his tent and says her friends will be safe if she pleasures him. She says her people do not believe in doing favors for safety, but pleasures him anyway, then kills him with his own dagger. His death cry draws some of his men to check on him, but when they open his tent flap, Lorna pretends to be making love to him, and they leave. His men outside make small talk about raping Lorna when their chief is done with her, or if not her, at least the men, particularly Chris.Meanwhile Benson has worked his way out of his ropes and freed the rest of the team. He says they have to complete the mission at all costs and leave Lorna behind, so they flee, but he has a change of heart and returns to rescue Lorna, finding her already having gotten out of the Bedouin camp. She has accidentally set fire to the chief's tent, and all of his men are now after them. They quickly make it back to the buried weapons and unearth them, using them to kill or fend off most of the Bedouin. Realizing they are still outnumbered, they quickly drive the rest of the way to the oasis.There, Benson tells them their mission: they are to blow up an oil refinery. They sneak in and plant explosives. As it blows up, the refinery guards pursue them and gun down everyone but Benson, who sees Lorna die but himself escapes.In the next scene, Benson is recounting the tragic end of his mission to the man who originally tasked him with it, saying that only he escaped, ""by some miracle."" He shows sadness over the death of his team.Benson leaves the building. Outside, on the street, he is in a crosswalk. A car drives past and gunshots ring out.

The Little Convict,1979,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0079475/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"After failing to sell any of his paintings at a funfair, an artist begins to tell his granddaughter about the origins of his paintings. We are then transported on board a British convict ship headed for New South Wales where we meet six convicts; Toby Nelson (a young boy), Polly Nelson (Toby's older sister), ""Dipper"" Davey (an old pick-pocket), Big George (a Blacksmith), Jack Doolan (a highwayman), and ""Silly Billy"" (a village idiot). The five men are selected to do hard labor for the military - under the supervision of Sergeant ""Bully"" Langden and Corporal ""Weasel"" Wesley - while Polly (secretly in love with Big George) is sent to work as a servant girl at the governor's home. Toby in the meantime saves a baby koala after Bully and Weasel kill it's mother while hunting, and keeps it as a pet, naming it Yo-Yo. But when Bully's continuing abuse of the convicts ends in old Dipper's death, Jack Doolan, fearing a similar fate, escapes and Big George is thrown in jail for helping him to escape. Left with only Yo-Yo to keep him company, Toby sets out to find Jack Doolan in order to free Big George. Along the way he meets an Aboriginee boy name Whooranga, who has a strange power over animals. Together with Jack Doolan, our three heroes plan a daring rescue attempt for Big George, only to be faced with making the ultimate sacrifice upon carrying it out...—Mr. J An old artist (Rolf Harris) sets up some paintings at Luna Park, Sydney, planning to sell them, but has trouble attracting any people until he performs ""Jake the Peg"". Most of the crowd move on again when the performance finishes, being uninterested in his paintings, so he starts telling his granddaughter about their origins.We then travel back in time to a British convict ship, the ""Northern Star"", as it sails towards a tiny colony on Sydney Cove with sixty-four convicts on board. Six of these convicts are a young boy named Toby Nelson, his older sister Polly, ""Big George"" Tomkins, a blacksmith, Jake ""Dipper"" Davey, a professional pickpocket who had only been nabbed when he became old and slow, William Watts, a ""village idiot"" who was on board for stealing a pig from a farmer - he had been caught when he tried to sell the same pig to the same farmer on the same day, an action that led to him being nicknamed ""Silly Billy"" after his trial - and Jack Doolan, a highwayman who had used some money he had robbed to buy bread and cheese, which he was passing around to a group of hungry people when the constabulary found him. Jack had given Toby the reins of his horse and Polly some of the bread and cheese, which led to them being charged as two of ""the Doolan gang"".After a journey of eight months, the Northern Star sails through the headlands into the harbour on whose shores the colony is built. The convicts are greeted by the Lieutenant Governor, Colonel Lindsay Lightfoot, left in charge of the colony while the Governor is inspecting Norfolk Island. He reads out the rules of the colony and warns the convicts of the consequences of disobedience of orders. Toby and Polly see each other for the first time since the ship left England - women convicts had been kept in a separate area - but their reunion is cut short by a tall officer, Sergeant ""Bully"" Langden.Bully tells Colonel Lightfoot's aide, Captain Pertwee, that the military need five men to work on the Government farm, and he selects Big George, Jack, Dipper, Silly Billy and Toby for the task. Polly is taken away from the docks by Colonel Lightfoot's wife Augusta to assist her cook and laundrymaid. Toby falls to the ground before the convicts can be given the order to march. When Bully kicks away a cup of water that a woman tries to give Toby, Big George confronts Bully, who has to be rescued by several other soldiers. He decides to fix the troublemaking by marching the convicts straight to the blacksmith's shop, where they are each fitted with heavy chains around their ankles.Early next morning, the five convicts are aroused by Bully's deputy, Corporal ""Weazel"" Wesley, who issues them with a small ration of bread and some work tools before marching them out to begin their first day's work. Toby starts to struggle when the day gets hotter, but Dipper is the first to fall, gasping with pain and holding his bad leg trying not to collapse. The other convicts carry him to the shade, give him some water and fan him with his hat. He starts to recover when Weazel finds them. Jack cheerfully invites Weazel to join their ""picnic"", but Weazel aims his rifle at Jack's heart. A shot is fired, but Bully, who had fired the shot at a group of kangaroos in the scrub, calls on Weazel to help him. They soon find another slower target in the form of a koala and shoot it dead. Toby tries to rescue the baby koala who is on his dead mother's back, but he is caught by Bully, who throws the baby koala back into the bush.That night, Toby is too unhappy to either eat dinner or talk to anyone. As his friends lay down in their rough bunks, Dipper brings out a small round object, and as he opens it up, it begins to play some music. The object is a gentleman's watch with a music box in it, the only possession Dipper can truly call his own - it was given to him by his father, and long ago had been worn by Dipper's great-grandfather. The music sends Dipper's friends to sleep, allowing him to creep out of the hut and distract the guards by throwing some pebbles. As they chase after what they suppose is an intruder, Dipper sneaks back to the work site, finds the baby koala back near his mother's body, tucks him in an inside pocket that the baby thinks is his mother's pouch, and returns to the hut, distracting the guards again with some wild animal noises. In the hut, he takes out the baby koala and puts it in the crook of Toby's elbow. Toby wakes up and sees the koala and his face turns to joy, but no one, least of all Dipper, will admit to knowing how it got there.Four weeks on, Polly has become Augusta's only servant girl, and spends time shopping at the store so she can hear the news of the convicts. She finds out that Bully was reprimanded by the Lieutenant Governor for leaving the prisoners while he was shooting at the kangaroos. After Polly hears that Toby is allowed to keep his pet koala and Bully is ordered to remove Toby's leg-irons, Augusta sees Polly smile for the first time.At tea that night, Polly hears from Captain Pertwee that one of the convicts has been injured and, according to the surgeon, may not live. Terrified, she runs up the streets of Sydney Town towards the convicts' hut, but finds out that it is not Toby who is dying, but Dipper. The convicts had been felling trees, and Dipper had suffered another one of his leg cramps, but was ordered to continue working by Bully. Unable to move, Dipper couldn't get out of the way of a large and heavy trunk when it crashed to the ground so quickly that the other convicts weren't able to help him. With his last bit of strength, Dipper presses something into Toby's hand and tells him that he wants him to have it. When the other convicts have moved away, Toby shows the object, the music box watch, to Polly.In the days that follow Dipper's burial, Jack's behaviour changes - he stops making cheeky remarks to Bully as they work, he no longer calls Corporal Wesley ""Weazel"" to his face, and is allowed to hold the reins of Bully's mare as he quietens and calms it each morning. Toby often sees Jack looking towards the distant Blue Mountains, and one night hears Jack and George whispering to each other, and knows that Jack is planning to escape, not wanting to suffer the same fate as Dipper. All seems normal at the worksite the next morning, until George starts breaking all of the tools in pieces, drawing the attention of the soldiers and allowing Jack to untether the friendly horse and quietly turn it towards the mountains.Later that day, George is made to pay for assisting in Jack's escape - he is given fifty lashes while tied to a large wooden triangle in the public square and thrown into a punishment cell on Bully's orders, where he will spend every night for the next six months while he works at the blacksmith's shop during the day. Weeks later, Toby mouths the word ""tonight"" to George as he and Billy pass the cell on their way to work. That night, Polly, whom the Lightfoots have given permission to visit George in the punishment cell, and Toby smuggle some food from the Governor's kitchen and see George in the cell. George longs for Jack to help him escape the cell, and Toby comes up with a plan to search for Jack in the bush, taking the bundle of food intended for George, and his own pet koala. A noise causes Bully and Weazel to wake in the guardhouse and see Toby's shadow between the wire fence and scrub. Toby runs for his life and doesn't stop until he cannot hear the shouts of the pursuing guards behind him.As he continues to search for Jack in the night, keeping a tall mountain peak in front of him to stop him going around in circles, he gets a feeling that someone is following him, but he hears little, and doesn't see anything when he stops to look. He is sure that if it is one of the guards, they would make much more noise. He eventually flops onto the ground exhausted and sleeps until the early dawn when he is woken by a kookaburra and some cockatoos. He eats some of the provisions and then resumes his search.That evening, with his throat sore from calling Jack's name and all of the food Polly had provided gone, he is close to exhaustion when he finds a clearing with the remains of a dug-out fire. He feels the fire's ashes to see how warm they are when the sound of a snapping twig causes him to turn around. He sees a young Aborigine with a spear in his hand and a dingo at his side, but although Toby is terrified at first, he soon realises that the other boy is actually a friend. They get to know each other, with their arms and some sand providing them with ways to overcome their natural language barrier. Toby eventually finds out that his new friend is named Wahroonga, and he had been following Toby through the bush to make sure that no harm came to him or his koala. Wahroonga introduces Toby to his animal friends, a dingo and a cockatoo, shows him how to find water and food and invites him to stay the night in a gunya, an Aboriginal sleeping shelter on the edge of the clearing.Next morning, after Toby explains that he is trying to find Jack, a man riding on a horse, Wahroonga leads him to and along a dry river bed until they find a horse's hoof prints. They spend the next few hours following the river bed looking for more prints and other small clues to Jack's possible escape route. At one point, Wahroonga motions to Toby to stand still as he hears a horse neighing, and they hide behind a bush as two bushrangers pass them. Just as Toby and Wahroonga are ready to leave their hiding place, they hear a third horse approach them. They try to bury themselves in the sandy creek bed, but Toby hears the horse slow and stop, then footsteps approach them and a foot taps Toby on the shoulder. He is scared when he first turns around, until he realises that it's Jack Doolan.After introducing Jack to Wahroonga, Toby tells him stories of his adventures in the bush, but when Jack thinks Toby has run away too, he tells him about what has happened to Big George and why he ran away. Jack follows the path the bushrangers took earlier, and above their camp, he gets Toby and Wahroonga to roll a large boulder down the hill into the camp. It smashes into one of the huts, giving Jack a chance to unleash both of the horses and send one into the bush while he gallops back to the boys on the other. Moments later, Jack is back on his horse with Toby, Wahroonga and the koala on the other, with the dingo following them and the cockatoo overhead as they make their way back towards Sydney Town.On the edge of the convict settlement, Jack tells Toby that they will need to distract the guards to allow them to get near George's cell, and they will need some tools to break down the cell door. Toby remembers seeing tools in the storehouse next to the cell. As the guards are being served tea and stew, Jack gives a signal and Wahroonga gives a soft whistle to the cockatoo, which flies toward the line of soldiers and causes them to scatter in all directions. Another signal from Jack, and Wahroonga whispers a command to the dingo, which snaps and snarls at the soldiers' horses, causing them to rear and plunge, break their tethers and bolt toward the bush. The soldiers set off in pursuit and leave the settlement unguarded. Wahroonga keeps watch as Jack and Toby head for the store house. They find no tools there, only barrels of rum and oil. Jack gets Toby to open the oil barrels while he takes the rum and pours some into the soldiers' tea mugs and the rest into the boiler of tea. He makes it back to the store house just as the soldiers return with their horses.The soldiers drink the tea and line up for several cupfuls from the cook, who eventually tastes the brew for himself, all getting drunk on the rum Jack had put into it. As they boisterously continue drinking the tea, Jack sends Toby to collect Silly Billy while he heads for the guardhouse to get the keys to Big George's cell. With all three convicts back in the store house, Jack begins to pour some of the oil on the ground while Toby and Billy take the key and unlock the punishment cell. Silly Billy yells at George in case he is asleep, but Bully hears the noise and tries to rouse the soldiers. Jack hurls the last barrel of oil to the ground and hops over it before it spreads everywhere. The convicts think they will be trapped by the soldiers, but one by one the soldiers slide on the oil and fall to the ground. Despite his drunken state, Bully stays focussed on Jack and while kneeling, he aims a rifle at him. At that moment, a boomerang thrown by Wahroonga hits Bully on the back of his neck, sending his gunshot through a window of the Governor's house (causing a frightened Polly to drop the oil lamp she is carrying) before he falls unconscious to the ground.At the first shouts of the commotion made by the drunken soldiers, Colonel Lightfoot, convinced by his wife Augusta that the Aborigines were attacking the settlement, had dashed out of the house with a sword in his hand leaving her on her own. She hears light footsteps and sees a flickering gleam of lights, and when the door opens, she faints out of fear before she can find out what happened. Polly is also trembling with fright - the lights come from the flame of the dropped lamp which ignited on the now-spreading oil. The fire engulfs the house so fast that Polly and Augusta are trapped inside.As the four convicts begin their escape, Wahroonga sees the flames coming out of the house and signals to them. Big George recognises it as the Governor's house, and leads a mad dash toward the building. There is smoke and flame coming out of every window as they arrive, and they can hear Polly's and Augusta's cries from within. George finds a large water barrel with a bucket beside it, throws some water over himself and Jack and gets Toby to throw more water on them as they smash the door off its hinges. Inside, George follows the sound of Polly's cries and sees her and Augusta at the bottom of a staircase, with a fallen beam blocking their escape.George bends over and puts his shoulders underneath the large beam, straining his body to slowly ease it up enough for Augusta and Polly to leave. Hearing a squad of soldiers led by the Lieutenant Governor himself, Toby contemplates escaping, but throws more buckets of water on Billy, Jack and himself before they rush in to guide Polly and Augusta out of the house. With all five of them outside, George heaves the beam off his shoulders and rushes to join them as the house begins to collapse behind him. Polly and Augusta fall into the arms of their respective brother and husband. A couple of hours later, the four convicts explain to Colonel Lightfoot all of the things they did, why they did them and who had helped them. Toby tries to introduce Wahroonga in the middle of his story, only to discover that he has disappeared into the shadows of the bush along with his dingo and cockatoo, which gives a farewell shriek on its way towards the mountains.The artist wraps up his story by telling us that Bully is found guilty of being drunk on duty and locked away in the same punishment cell into which he had thrown Big George, until his temper improved, while the Lieutenant Governor grants the brave convicts who saved his wife full pardons and grants of land on which they could start their own farms - a happy ending for Billy, George, Jack and Polly. He starts to tell us about Toby, but then looks at his watch and realises that he has to end the story because it's getting late. He tells us that the watch plays a little tune when he opens it up, and he has had it for several years, ever since it was given to him by a dear old man named Dipper. He then points his granddaughter to the nearby merry-go-round, where the people that she sees on it bear likenesses to the characters from his paintings and the animation."

Seeking Asylum,1979,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078963/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Roberto uses alternative teaching methods, but manages to create a special bond with his kindergarten students. Roberto has a new job as the teacher at a nursery school. The first child he meets is Gianluigi, who's mute. Roberto is spirited, bringing a TV into class, then a donkey. He takes children on an unscheduled field trip to their fathers' plant. He dates Isabella, the mother of one of his students, and soon she's pregnant. He's moody about it, so Isabella leaves for her family's abandoned movie theater in Sardinia, but not before Roberto is briefly arrested and questioned about past radical activity. He takes ten children, including Gianluigi, to Sardinia for the baby's birth, and there, surrounded by the sea, the mother of us all, he and Gianluigi play out their surprising bond.—<jhailey@hotmail.com> This is a 1979 film directed by Marco Ferreri, winner of the Silver Bear, grand jury prize at the 1979 Berlin Film Festival.
For the first time in a nursery school in Corticella (Bologna) a male teacher takes service. Roberto, this is his name, is an excellent educator, who immediately has an excellent relationship with children (who among other things greatly appreciate the unusual non ""maternal"" presence in the teaching staff), and with colleagues; however his educational methods, rather unconventional and inspired by a great freedom, will lead him to have some problems with law enforcement officers.
Roberto, a kindergarten teacher, is well received by his colleagues, loved by the children, but hindered by parents who do not understand his relationships with their children. A special bond is born with a psychically disturbed child. M. Ferreri made an open film, an extraordinary fable that goes in search of itself, passing through the scenes of everyday life and fiction and following the non-story of a delicate and poignant Benigni.
Roberto establishes a relationship with Isabella, the unmarried mother of his pupil Michela, and the woman finds herself pregnant again; moreover, he is particularly friendly with Gianluigi, a child suffering from behavioral disorders, who does not speak and eats very little and in consideration of this he is removed from kindergarten to be hosted in a nursing home. In the following summer, Isabella, close to giving birth, expresses her intention to move to Sardinia where she owns a disused cinema. Roberto, although not expressly invited to follow her, accompanies her together with a group of children including Gianluigi. Just on the day when Isabella gives birth to her second child, Gianluigi begins to show the first real signs of healing."

Amor de Perdição,1979,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9249616/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"In the eighteenth century the thwarted love affair between a young man from a good family and his 15-year-old neighbor. But the young lovers' families are fiercely opposed. The third installment of Oliveira's Tetralogy is a brilliant and devastating portrait of young lovers tragically separated by a bitter feud between their aristocratic families. In Doomed Love Oliveira tested his belief in a creative merging of theatrical, literary and cinematic narrative traditions. His radical approach to adaptation captures the multilayered language of Camilo Castelo Branco's eponymous epic novel to offer a virtual phenomenology of life and love in 18th century Portugal. After a disastrous premiere on Portuguese television, the theatrical release of Oliveira's re-edited version was quickly hailed as a landmark in the history of the European art film.—Harvard Film Archive"

Uthiri Pookkal,1979,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0235848/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A hedonist/sadist makes life hell for everyone around him. Uthiri Pookal is one movie that gets quoted so often when popular directors talk about the best tamil movie ever made.It is always a tricky proposition to come up with a negative character as the hero of a movie. It is as risky as walking on thin ice. One wrong move and you are destined for a nasty fall. Mahendran does this balancing act with so much elan that it leaves you spellbound to the script. The fact that Vijayan is not portrayed as the stereotypical villain adds to the authenticity of his character. What transpires on screen is a battle between a person who is sensitive enough to deeply love his kids and a person who can ruthlessly do anything to attain the things he has set his eyes on.The effort that has gone into etching each of the character of the movie pays rich dividend as it adds a lot of value to the storyline. The screenplay is something that many of the present day tamil directors can use as an example while writing their scripts. With a solid storyline, the onus was on the screenplay to make the movie interesting. The scenes are neatly placed that one scene gels into the next one very smoothly and without any hiccups. The tight closeup shots of the lead characters during the highly charged scenes shows the faith the director had in his actors and the actors have repaid the faith with some brilliant performances.The scenes where Vijayan slaps Aswini or Sarathbabu are not shown directly but are shown in a subtle and beautiful way. The sound followed by the heroine holding her hands to her face or Sarathbabu washing away the blood in the river are artistic and shows the director's ability to think beyond the ordinary. One another unsung hero of this movie is Ilayaraaja. For each character, he comes up with a brilliant theme music. Be it the ominous sounding tabla for Vijayan or the soft & sad music for Aswini or the funky bits for the second heroine, Ilayaraaja proves his mettle in the BGM department.This is a movie about human relations, love and the fall from grace of a person possessed by greed. A movie that should be watched for the sheer narrative style and honest story telling. A classic indeed!"
