Peter Venkman, Ray Stantz and Egon Spengler work at Columbia University. where they delve into the paranormal and fiddle with many unethical experiments on their students. As they are kicked out of the University, they really understand the paranormal and go into business for themselves. Under the new snazzy business name of 'Ghostbusters', and living in the old firehouse building they work out of, they are called to rid New York City of paranormal phenomenon at everyone's whim. - for a price. They make national press as the media reports the Ghostbusters are the cause of it all. Thrown in jail by the EPA, the mayor takes a chance and calls on them to help save the city. Unbeknownst to all, a long dead Gozer worshiper (Evo Shandor) erected a downtown apartment building which is the cause of all the paranormal activity. They find out the building could resurrect the ancient Hittite god, Gozer, and bring an end to all of humanity. Who are you gonna call to stop this terrible world-ending menace?—Chad Grill After delving too deep into the mysterious metaphysical realm, three scientists and ambitious supernatural researchers find themselves out of work. As a result, the team comes up with Ghostbusters, a paranormal search-and-destroy service, bent on proving everyone wrong by capturing the Big Apple's rogue spirits. Indeed, a malevolent interdimensional entity has targeted the bustling, unsuspecting city, possessing two seemingly ordinary New Yorkers to do its bidding. In other words, the fearless Ghostbusters are on to something big for the first time in their brief career. However, do they have what it takes to look evil in the eye, and confront the ancient shape-shifting demon Gozer, the Destructor?—Nick Riganas Three odd-ball scientists get kicked out of their cushy positions at a university in New York City where they studied the occult. They decide to set up shop in an old firehouse and become Ghostbusters, trapping pesky ghosts, spirits, haunts, and poltergeists for money. They wise-crack their way through the city, and stumble upon a gateway to another dimension, one which will release untold evil upon the city. The Ghostbusters are called on to save the Big Apple.—Greg Bole <bole@life.bio.sunysb.edu> After being kicked out of their university, parapsychology professors Spengler, Stantz and Venkman decide to go into business for themselves by trapping and removing ghosts from haunted houses. After some initial skepticism, business is soon booming as The Ghost Busters rid New York of its undead. When a downtown skyscraper becomes the focal point of spirit activity linked to the ancient god Gozer, however, the problem may be more than the team can handle.—Jean-Marc Rocher <rocher@fiberbit.net> The film opens within the New York Public Library, where a librarian (Alice Drummond) is first gathering books, before heading downstairs to a remote and empty section. She places a book back on the shelf, not noticing that the books behind her are levitating across the aisle. Later, she passes the card catalogue shelves as they open behind her and suddenly begin to hurl their contents into the air. Frightened and screaming, she runs through the room before being stopped by an unseen ghost, which scares her terribly. This leads into the title card.After the opening title shot, the film continues in the Paranormal Studies Dept. of Columbia University, where Dr. Peter Venkman (Bill Murray) is conducting a test on ESP with a nerdy male student (Steven Tash) and an attractive female student (Jennifer Runyon). Venkman continually flirts and lies about her abilities, while enjoying administering electric shocks to the male student. Having finally had enough, the male student departs, and Venkman continues to flirt with the young woman. Dr. Ray Stantz (Dan Aykroyd) enters, and frantically begins to tell Venkman about the sighting at the library, insisting they leave at once to check it out. Venkman makes a date with the student, and follows Stantz out.Upon arriving at the library, Venkman and Stantz meet up with Dr. Egon Spengler (Harold Ramis), and Venkman proceeds to ask a series of personal (and cynical) questions about her medical and social history, before the three head down to the area the ghost supposedly inhabits. While down there, the three men collect ectoplasmic residue, discover a tall ""symmetrical stacking"" of books from floor to ceiling, and narrowly escape a falling bookcase.Turning the same corner as the librarian, they see the ghost: a transparent form of an elderly lady (Ruth Oliver), reading a book. Having no idea what to do, Venkman begins to talk to the ghost as if it were a lady in a bar. She shushes him, before Stantz proclaims he knows what to do. They stealthily approach the ghost, before Ray yells, ""Get her!"" and the ghost mutates to a ghoulish, skeletal apparition, scaring the hell out of the trio, who run screaming from the library. They ignore the library administrator (John Rothman) in their frantic way out.After they've calmed down a bit, they walk back to the university. Venkman mocks Ray's idiotic plan, and Egon announces that based on his readings, they now have a ""good change of actually catching a ghost and holding it indefinitely."" However, once they get back to the school, they meet the dean (Jordan Charney) who tells them that their grant has been terminated due to their shoddy and highly suspect findings, research, and methods.Peter and Ray sit drinking on campus, and Ray mopes about their bleak prospects, before Peter suggests this turn of events happened so that they could go into business for themselves, as the world's first firm for paranormal investigations and eliminations.Peter convinces Ray to take out a mortgage on his childhood home, and use it for startup capital. The trio checks out an empty firehouse to use as a headquarters, and while Egon enumerates the many problems with the building itself, Ray is beside himself with excitement at the prospect of living and working there, specially with the fire-fighter pall in the middle of the hall.At 55 Central Park West, classical musician Dana Barrett (Sigourney Weaver) arrives home with groceries. Her neighbor, übernerd and accountant Louis Tully (Rick Moranis), stops her in the hall, telling her that her television had been left on. Louis badgers her about an upcoming party he's hosting, and Dana finally brushes him away and enters her apartment. As she is putting away her groceries, she notices that her eggs are now leaping out of their shells and cooking themselves on her countertop. She then hears a growl coming from her refrigerator, opens it, and sees an otherworldly temple, and a doglike creature that growls the word ""Zuul"" (voiced byIvan Reitman), before Dana frantically slams the door shut.Back at the newly christened Ghostbusters headquarters, Ray pulls up, shocking Peter with the new business car, an old beat-up ambulance that needs a lot of work. Peter goes back inside, makes small talk with their new secretary, Janine (Annie Potts), and waits around for business.Dana arrives seeking an explanation for the events in her kitchen. Peter flirts vigorously with her, while Egon and Ray examine her briefly, and speculate as to what may be the cause of her encounter. After deciding on a plan of action, Peter insists on going with Dana back to her apartment, where he haphazardly looks around, but mostly flirts with her. He looks in the kitchen, and sees the eggs on the counter, but nothing else out of the ordinary. Dana is annoyed, but Peter continues to beg her for a date, pledging to solve her problems in an effort to impress her.Later, the Ghostbusters sit around enjoying dinner celebrating getting their first customer, but Ray has to let them know that the meal has just used the last of the business' petty cash. Fortunately, even as the business' failure is staring them in the face, Janine finally gets an urgent call about a ghost that needs removal immediately. Peter, Ray, and Egon quickly dress, and race out of their headquarters, to the Sedgwick Hotel, where the manager (Michael Ensign) informs them of a ghost on the 12th floor. They've always had problems, he tells them, but lately it's gotten out of hand. The Ghostbusters assure him they'll take care of it, and head up to the 12th floor. Egon and Ray worry about their equipment, which Peter describes as an unlicensed nuclear accelerator, and decide that they'll ignore the danger for now. They make chitchat conversation with a guest (Murray Rubin) outside the elevator, and they tell him they are going to kill a cockroach, to which the guest answers, ""That's gotta be some cockroach."" He takes the next elevator.Almost immediately after the Ghostbusters exit the elevator, a maid startles them, and they nearly kill her with their proton packs. The three split up, and Ray eventually sees the ghost: a rotund, green blob, eating everything on a room service cart. Ray tries to hit it with his proton pack but misses, and it flies away, frightened. Ray calls Peter on his walkie-talkie, and Peter, who is now face-to-face with the ghost, is suddenly attacked by it. Ray runs to Peter, and finds him on his back, covered in green slime, but otherwise OK. Egon calls them and informs the other two that the ghost went into the hotel's ballroom.They calm the hotel manager, and then set to work on containing the little green ghost. While shooting their weapons all over the room, Egon suddenly warns the others not to cross their streams, because to do so would result in the destruction of ""all life as you know it."" After destroying much of the ballroom with their seriously unstable proton packs, the Ghostbusters finally trap the ghost, and burst triumphantly from the ballroom, before the anxious manager and a host of guests burst in. The Ghostbusters haggle with the manager over the $5000 bill for a moment, and then head back home, victorious.This successful hunt proves to be but the first of a sudden rash of hauntings mean brisk business for the Ghostbusters. There is a montage of a series of missions, news spots, newspaper clippings, and stories about the Ghostbusters' new fame and success. There are even interviewed byLarry KingandJoe Franklin(themselves).Peter briefly meets with Dana after her orchestra practice, and flirts a bit with her before telling her about Zuul, whom he has discovered is associated with an ancient Sumerian god of destruction, Gozer. He tells her that he'll go over it in more detail over dinner, and finally, she agrees to a date.The Ghostbusters soon hire a fourth man, Winston Zeddemore (Ernie Hudson), a black, blue-collar type guy, who is just looking for a job. Hired immediately by Ray and Peter, Winston is handed a couple of traps and led off by Ray to learn about getting rid of the ghosts, while Peter is informed that there is a man from the EPA waiting for him.Walter Peck (William Atherton), the pompous EPA delegate, condescendingly talks to Peter, refusing to acknowledge that Peter is, in fact, a PhD, and therefore, Dr. Venkman, and briefly questions him about the possible environmental impact of their business, and specifically, their custom-built storage facility. He demands to see it, but Peter just patronizes him for a bit before throwing him out.Ray shows Winston how they unload the ghosts they've trapped into the storage facility, while Egon admits he is worried about the facility's looming capacity problem and the larger problem it indicates. To illustrate, Egon tells them that his latest research indicates that the city is experiencing a colossal increase in paranormal activity, comparing it to a 600-pound Twinkie. Peter joins them, mentioning the EPA, and memorably asks, ""What about the Twinkie?""A brief shot on the top of Dana's building shows that dog-like gargoyle statues atop the roof are breaking apart and real animals are underneath the stone.Back inside, Dana arrives home, and is once again accosted by Louis who is raving about his party. He is disappointed when Dana tells him she has a date. She gets rid of him again, and goes into her apartment, undressing and talking on the phone. She sits in an armchair for a moment before noticing the same growling sounds from the kitchen. Before she can react, three arms burst from the chair and hold Dana down as she is dragged through her kitchen door to one of the Terror Dogs. Another shot on the roof shows that the gargoyles on the roof have completely broken apart, and whatever was in them is loose.Louis' party continues as he rambles on about the price efficiency of his hosting a party. Two guests show up, hand Louis their coats, and he throws them -unnoticing- on the terror dog sitting at his desk. It roars, and bursts through the door, apparently only after Louis. He runs out of the apartment, through Central Park, before being cornered and attacked outside Tavern on the Green.Meanwhile, Peter arrives at Dana's apartment, stepping over the carnage of Louis' party, and knocks on the door. Dana opens it, dressed in a slinky red dress, and asks, ""Are you the Keymaster?"" Peter says no, so she angrily slams the door in his face. He knocks again, and enters after answering her question ""yes"". Dana says that she is Zuul, and they must prepare for the coming of Gozer, The Destructor. Peter talks to her and resists the possessed Dana's aggressive advances, before requesting to speak with the real Dana. At first, Dana coyly replies ""There is no Dana, there is only Zuul,"" trying to kiss him but Peter, still trying to get through to the real Dana Barrett, restrains her. The possessed Dana now becomes visibly annoyed at his persistence, as Peter once again inquires about the real Dana; she replies in an unearthly demonic voice ""There is no Dana, only Zuul!"" Peter sarcastically dismisses her and gives her to the count of three to talk to the real Dana. With each count, Dana presents further signs of her possession: at first demonically rolling her eyes, then panting like an animal, and finally roaring like a demonic beast and magically floating above her bed. She turns over in midair, to face down at Peter whom asks her to please come down. Dana roars fiercely at him, finally frightening him.Louis, looking disheveled and generally abused, runs out from Central Park rambling, and asks a hansom cab horse if he is the ""Gatekeeper"". The driver (Danny Stone) chases him off, so he runs away, screaming about a sign of Gozer's arrival.The NYPD arrives at the Ghostbusters headquarters, to drop off Louis, who's been captured and rejected by both the city jail and Bellevue's psych ward. Egon looks at him briefly, and takes him inside. Louis reveals his name is Vinz Clortho, Keymaster of Gozer. He goes on about the history of Gozer, how the god assumes various forms and would mean the destruction of the civilization he targets. During the exam, Peter calls, and tells Egon about the developments with Dana, who is now lies heavily sedated on the bed next to him. Egon tells Peter in return about Louis' psychic transformation, and insists Peter come back to headquarters.Winston and Ray are driving back to the office, Winston driving while Ray examines the ""very odd"" blueprints of Dana's apartment building. Winston asks Ray about his belief in God, and speculates that the reason they've been so busy lately is because the dead have been rising from the grave, as it was foretold in the Book of Revelations, as a precursor to judgment day, and the end of the world. Ray ponders this.Back at headquarters, Walter Peck has returned with a court order, a cop, and a Con Edison worker (Larry Dilg), intent on shutting down the storage facility. Egon tries to talk them out of it, and Peter arrives just in time to antagonize Peck some more, before the cop intervenes and the Con Ed guy, although highly reticent handling equipment he has never seen before, shuts off the power grid. A warning buzzer sounds, and everyone clears the building, as the storage facility rumbles and begins to destroy the basement.A supernatural light show occurs, as all kinds of paranormal energy bursts through the building and shoots out of the roof. Across town, Dana, immediately wakes up from her sedation, and walks toward her living room window. Louis is excited, claiming this is the sign he was waiting for. Ray and Winston arrive to witness the disaster's immediate aftermath even as Peck demands they all be arrested for causing it. Enraged at this self-righteous blowhard outright lying about them while ignoring his own responsibility in this disaster, Egon attacks Peck, getting everyone arrested.Ghosts run rampant through the city, but most of the energy seems to run directly to Dana's building. Dana growls at the energy, ripping out the wall of her apartment in a small explosion.Sitting in jail, Ray shows Egon and Peter the blueprints of Dana's apartment building, pointing out highly unorthodox methods and materials, especially near the roof. Egon tells them that the building, he's discovered, was designed by an insane architect/surgeon named Ivo Shandor. In the 20's, Shandor was evidently so disgusted by the First World War, that he decided he would try to bring about the end of the world with a secret society of Gozer worshippers. They performed rituals atop Dana's building, and the roof itself was meant to be the gateway to allow Gozer into our world. A guard arrives (Reginald VelJohnson), and tells the Ghostbusters that the mayor wants to meet them, to deal with the rash of ghosts and other unbelievable phenomenon happening throughout the city.Louis arrives at Dana's demolished apartment, introducing himself as the Keymaster. A smiling Dana responds she is the Gatekeeper and they share a passionate kiss before slowly making their way up to the roof via a mythical staircase behind the wall where Dana's fridge used to be as lightning flashes ominously.The four men and Peck are brought before the Mayor (David Margulies) both arguing their sides. Peck claims the Ghostbusters are con artists and use nerve gases to force people to hallucinate and have visions of ghosts. Winston steps up and defends the things he's seen as real while numerous city officials like the Fire Chief present evidence of bizarre phenomena of which the Ghostbusters have the only possible explanation. Ray reveals that the city is headed for a disaster of ""biblical proportions"", and Venkman finally appeals to the possibility that the mayor could be responsible for saving the lives of millions of registered voters. Convinced, the Mayor throws Peck out of his office and offers whatever support he can to the Ghostbusters.People have gathered all around the apartment building, which has clearly become the center of the entire mess. They cheer as the Ghostbusters arrive with a police escort and following National Guard troops, and Peter mugs for the crowd. The four men put on their proton packs and are prepared to enter, but a sudden earthquake seems to swallow them beneath the street. Eventually, they emerge unharmed to the continued cheers from the crowd. They band together and head inside.Once inside, they must climb the stairs to Dana's 22nd floor apartment. Dana and Louis lie on a large stone table as lightning flashes in the dark sky above them. Dana seductively wakes up, followed by Louis. They stare in awe at the large Temple in front of them then walk toward the opposite stone pedestals where the Terror Dog statues once stood. The Ghostbusters arrive to find Dana's apartment burned out and more or less destroyed. They see the staircase in the kitchen and go up.Dana and Louis stand on their pedestals and raise their arms to the sky. They are suddenly struck by bolts of lightning which they redirect toward the temple door, causing it to grind open and signaling the arrival of Gozer the Gozerian. With the temple doors finally open, Dana and Louis now absorb their full power as the Ghostbusters arrive just in time to see the lightning converge on the demonic couple in a huge blast, transforming them back into the monstrous Terror Dogs, who now turn and roar menacingly at the Ghostbusters before leaping towards the side of the Temple doors.Gozer appears in the form of an exotic female with a tall, dark flattop and blood red eyes (Slavitza Jovan). Egon points out that she's not really a woman, but rather, takes the shape of whatever it wants. Peter goads Ray into talking to her. Ray very formally requests that Gozer returns to her place of origin, but she responds by asking if he is a god. He says no, and Gozer responds by shooting lightning from her fingers and nearly hurling the Ghostbusters off the roof.They regroup and decide to attack Gozer, but she nimbly jumps clear of their streams and lands behind them. Another attack proves fruitless as she disappears rather than being caught in the streams. Believing they are victorious, the Ghostbusters begin to celebrate, but it is short-lived as Gozer's booming voice is heard above the city demanding that they ""choose the form of the Destructor"".Peter tells everyone to clear their minds, and think of nothing, so no form will be taken, but it is clearly too late. Ray admits he did his best, but something just popped in his mind, something he thought could never harm anyone. ""It's the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man.""A 10-story, white, puffy marshmallow man begins to walk the streets of the city, crushing everything underfoot. When he is close enough, the Ghostbusters open fire, setting Mr. Stay Puft ablaze, as he begins to climb the building, King Kong style.Running for cover, the Ghostbusters appear out of ideas, until Egon suggests that they cross the streams, in an effort to close the door, and destroy Gozer's portal. Realizing this will probably mean their doom, the Ghostbusters go ahead with the plan, and set off to finish the god.Crossing the streams does indeed result in a catastrophic explosion, destroying the temple and incinerating the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man, raining molten marshmallow all over the street, including an onlooking Walter Peck.Back on the roof, the Ghostbusters have survived, and slowly emerge from the rubble, covered in marshmallow. Peter finds the roasted carcasses of the Terror Dogs, and believes Dana dead. Behind him, though, her fingers crack through the hardened ruins of the animal, and the Ghostbusters quickly break apart the rest, freeing her and Louis. They leave the roof, and Winston exclaims, ""I love this town!""As the closing credits roll, the Ghostbusters return to the street to the roaring cheers of the crowd. Peter and Dana kiss in front of everyone, Louis is helped into an ambulance, and as they drive off, the green ghost from the hotel roars toward the camera as it fades to black."
Beverly Hills Cop,1984,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086960/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A freewheeling Detroit cop pursuing a murder investigation finds himself dealing with the very different culture of Beverly Hills. After the murder of his childhood friend, the slick Detroit detective, Axel Foley, heads to sunny Beverly Hills, on a one-man mission to ferret out the killer and bring him to justice. Before long, Axel and his unorthodox methods unearth the lucrative drug operation of the powerful local crime kingpin, Victor Maitland; however, Foley, too, will find himself in deep trouble, as Lieutenant Andrew Bogomil wants him out of town. Now, Axel will have to team up with Detectives, John Taggart, and Billy Rosewood, to shed light on the thick conspiracy, and finish what he has started. Will Foley's total disregard for proper procedure bear fruit?—Nick Riganas Axel Foley is a Detroit cop who after the murder of his friend travels to California to investigate and track down the killer, who he believes operate an arts dealership as a cover in Beverly Hills. He teams up with two reluctant detectives from the Beverly Hills police force who were supposed to keep a watch on him, especially after seeing Foley's different approach to tackling the situations which is not acceptable by the chief of the local police.—Sami Al-Taher <staher2000@yahoo.com> Reckless but talented Detroit policeman Axel Foley (Eddie Murphy) conducts an unauthorized sting operation, using a truck full of cigarettes (seized by the police as evidence in another case) to attempt to bust two hustlers (Frank Pesce and Gene Borkan). The 'deal' is interrupted by two patrolmen, resulting in one criminal fleeing on foot and the other escaping in the truck, with Axel trapped in the back. After an extensive chase, causing widespread damage, the truck crashes and the other man runs off, leaving Axel empty-handed. At the police station, he is severely reprimanded by his ill-tempered boss, Inspector Todd (Gilbert R. Hill), who informs Axel that if he conducts any further unapproved operations, he will be fired and brought up on charges.Axel goes home to find his ex-con best friend Mikey Tandino (James Russo) in his apartment, fresh from a job he got in Beverly Hills working for their mutual childhood friend, Jenny Summers. Mikey shows off some German bearer bonds he ""borrowed"" from his employers, which momentarily concerns Axel, but he is more interested in catching up with his old friend. After a night of drinking, Axel and Mikey return home and are accosted outside Axel's apartment by a burly man Mikey recognizes as Zack (Jonathan Banks). Zack knocks Axel unconscious before he sees anything. He then confronts Mikey about the bearer bonds, then shoots him twice in the head. After the police respond, Axel asks Inspector Todd to be let in on the case, but Todd flatly refuses. Deciding to secretly root around from a different angle, Axel asks for and is granted two weeks' vacation time.Axel then drives his ""crappy blue Chevy Nova"" all the way to Beverly Hills, California and, masquerading as a reporter for magazine, manages to check into a suite at the high-end Beverly Palm Hotel. He then meets up with his old friend Jenny (Lisa Eilbacher), who tells Axel that she (and Mikey) work for international-British-born art dealer Victor Maitland (Steven Berkoff). Axel finagles his way into Maitland's office, where Zack is revealed (to the viewers) to be the art dealer's right-hand man. Axel presses Maitland for answers about Mikey, but Maitland has his bodyguards throw Axel out - literally through a glass window on the main floor.Outside, Axel is confronted by the Beverly Hills police over a report of disturbing the peace. Finding his gun, they arrest him for possessing a concealed weapon, as he cannot afford to identify himself as a police officer. At the police station, he is questioned by Sergeant John Taggart (John Ashton) and Detective Billy Rosewood (Judge Reinhold). Taggart takes issue with Axel's irreverence and punches him in the stomach. Lieutenant Andrew Bogomil (Ronny Cox) steps in to reprimand Taggart and presses Axel further, adding that he has spoken to Inspector Todd back in Detroit, who hints that Axel will be fired if he finds out that Axel is investigating Mikey's death.Jenny bails Axel out, and takes him back to the hotel, tailed all the while by Taggart and Rosewood, who have been assigned to watch him. As the detectives watch and wait across the street from the hotel in an unmarked car, Axel places a late supper order with room service to be delivered to them. He then coaxes a waiter to give him some bananas from a party tray, which he stuffs into the unmarked car's tailpipe while Rosewood and Taggart are distracted by the room service waiter. When Jenny and Axel leave the hotel, Taggart and Rosewood try to pursue, but their vehicle stalls, thanks to the bananas in the tailpipe.Axel and Jenny sneak into one of Maitland's warehouses, where they observe two of his men removing bearer bonds from a crate. Axel also discovers some coffee grounds around some of the crates. Axel then has Jenny follow the two men to a loading dock, where he sneaks in alone, noticing that the crate that formerly contained bearer bonds is placed among other crates waiting to be processed. When he crosses paths with a security guard, Axel passes himself off as a Customs inspector, demanding to see the records for all the crates in the warehouse.When Axel returns to the hotel, he spots Taggart and Rosewood still sitting in the unmarked car, waiting for him. Axel sneaks into the car, startling both men, who are irritable because they lost two days pay over his antics. Axel offers a truce of sorts, by letting them escort him to ""someplace classy."" ""Someplace classy"" turns out to be a stripper bar. While there, Axel notices two men entering the club wearing trench coats. Immediately suspicious because it is June (too hot for coats) he deduces that the men intend to rob the place. Axel's suspicions prove true, and the men produce shotguns from under their coats. Axel and Taggart successfully disarm the would-be robbers, leading to a new sense of respect between them. Later, Axel lies to Bogomil that Taggart and Rosewood had tailed him to the strip club and that they deserve all the credit for the collar, but Taggart and Rosewood admit to Bogomil that they had accepted Axel's invitation to the establishment and that Axel had initiated the take-down. Though thankful that Axel had prevented the robbery, Bogomil is fed up with Rosewood and Taggart's seeming incompetence and assigns two other detectives, Foster (Art Kimbro) and McCabe (Joel Bailey) to tail Axel. Axel gently reprimands Taggart and Rosewood before he leaves, pointing out the lie he told about their actions was working.The next day, Foster and McCabe catch up to Axel, who is loitering outside Maitland's gated mansion. When Maitland's car emerges from the compound, Axel jumps into his Nova and follows, with the detectives on his tail. Axel artfully loses Foster and McCabe and follows Maitland to a high class country club. He cons the maitre d' into letting him into the banquet hall, where he directly accuses Maitland of killing Mikey. Zack grabs Axel, who counter-throws him into the buffet, which brings the police to the venue. Axel is arrested again.At the police station, Bogomil demands answers, which Axel finally gives at what he knows; Maitland is smuggling bearer bonds into the country and he had Mikey killed because he stole some of the bonds. Axel also accuses Maitland of trafficking drugs, thanks to the coffee grounds that Axel found in the warehouse; Bogomil acknowledges that drug traffickers sometimes pack cocaine in piles of coffee grounds to throw off drug-sniffing dogs. Bogomil finally sympathizes with Axel, and is intrigued by the theories he presents, but admits that he cannot arrest Maitland on pure speculation. To make matters worse, the no-nonsense Police Chief Hubbard (Stephen Elliott) has ordered Axel to leave Beverly Hills, having heard of his numerous indiscretions throughout the city. Bogomil, under orders from Hubbard, tells Rosewood to escort Axel to the city limits.Axel mentions to Rosewood that Maitland has another shipment due, which he decided not to tell Bogomil once he realized Bogomil couldn't or wouldn't help. Rosewood takes him to see Jenny at the art gallery, where Axel asks for her warehouse key, but she insists on coming along. Rosewood waits in the unmarked car, not being able to go in until Axel and Jenny establish the presence of evidence, otherwise it would be an illegal search. Sneaking into the warehouse, Axel opens a crate that turns out to contain large bags of cocaine hidden inside coffee grounds. Suddenly, Zack and his men appear and take Axel and Jenny at gunpoint. Outside, Rosewood watches helplessly as Maitland and more of his men enter the warehouse. Axel and Maitland exchange words, and Zack admits to Axel that he killed Mikey. Maitland and Zack then leave with Jenny as their hostage, leaving Axel to the mercy of their men. Rosewood finally decides to enter the warehouse and helps Axel to escape. On their way to Maitland's mansion, Rosewood contacts Taggart, telling him about the drugs in the warehouse and to not tell Bogomil about anything. Taggart tells Foster and McCabe to check out the warehouse, then rushes to meet up with Axel and Rosewood.Axel, Rosewood and a reluctant Taggart sneak in to the mansion's grounds, but are soon pinned down by gunfire from Maitland's men. Back at the station, Bogomil is puzzled by the absence of the four detectives, then hears about a call of shots fired. When he discovers that the address is Maitland's, Bogomil calls for all cars to descend on the mansion.At the mansion, the police temporarily gain the upper hand, shooting down several gunmen. Axel tells Rosewood and Taggart to cover him as he enters the mansion. Inside, Zack has his weapon drawn and is hunting Axel. The cat-and-mouse game ends with Axel shooting Zack dead. Savoring his victory for a moment, Axel takes a large caliber bullet in his arm, courtesy of Maitland. Bogomil and a fleet of police officers arrive at the compound and arrest Maitland's surveillance and security teams. Inside the mansion, Axel confronts Maitland, who is holding his gun to Jenny's head. Neither man moves, until Bogomil appears behind Axel with his gun pointed at Maitland. Jenny takes advantage of this distraction to escape from Maitland, and Axel and Bogomil empty their guns into Maitland, killing him.When the smoke clears, Hubbard shows up, demanding answers. Bogomil makes up a story, insisting that he himself had led the investigation into Maitland's activities, thanks to Jenny and Axel's tips, and that Axel was merely an observer at the scene. Skeptical, Hubbard asks Taggart to confirm the story, which he does, having learned his lesson from the strip club incident. Finally, Hubbard decides to accept Bogomil's version of the events. Axel begs Bogomil to talk to Todd in Detroit, saying that if he lost his job in Detroit, he would move to Beverly Hills permanently and work as a private detective. Bogomil promises to clear everything up.That evening, Axel prepares to check out of the Beverly Palm when Rosewood and Taggart arrive. They tell him that Bogomil insisted that they personally escort him to the city limits. When Axel's tab is produced, Taggart informs the desk clerk that the Beverly Hills Police Department will pick it up. Axel is moved by the gesture and ""gives"" each detective a hotel bathrobe (also paid for by the police department). Once outside, Axel offers to share a drink with his new friends; Taggart, who originally touted doing things ""by the book,"" decides that one drink ""won't kill us"" and he and Rosewood follow Axel, who says that they will be going to ""the perfect place; you guys'll love it. Trust me."""

But as the evil Thuggee cult spreads through the region, infecting the opulent Pankot Palace, Indy and his team must brave the odds to do the impossible. Will Indiana Jones get out of the cursed Temple of Doom in one piece and live to tell the tale?—Nick Riganas A year before the events of ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"". Jones is in China in trade discussions with Chinese gangsters for an artifact. However, the gangsters also tried to ambush Jones but he escapes. Things go from bad to worse when his plane crashes over the Himalayas stranding him in the wastelands of India. Jones, along with a lounge singer (Wilhelmina), and a kid called ""Short Round"", get to a village that is suffering a crisis - the children are missing along with their sacred stones. Jones, Wilhelmina, and Short Round offer their help and stumble upon a temple, where a vicious voodoo doctor kills and tortures his victims by tearing their hearts out. Jones has to defeat the doctor and save the children and recover the sacred stones.—John Wiggins Eminent archaeologist Indiana Jones is back in his second adventure, this time to tackle the great terror surrounding the mysterious Temple of Doom. After crash landing in India, Indiana Jones and companions Short Round and Willie Scott end up in a small distressed village where the residents claim a dark power has stolen their precious stone... and their children! Agreeing to assist the village, Indiana and friends make their way to a nearby palace and inquire further into the strange happenings. Assuring Indiana he has no idea what he's talking about, prime minister Chatter Lal offers them to spend the night in the palace. However, it is that evening that Indiana discovers a secret passage into a booby-trapped temple and stumbles onto something he thought was long extinct. It seems the age old cut of Thuggee cult is attempting to rise once more, believing that with the power of the five Sankara stones they can rule the world. Now, it's up to Indiana to put a stop to the Thuggee campaign, rescue the lost children, win the girl and conquer the Temple of Doom.—Tomius J. Barnard In 1935 at the Club Obi Wan in Shanghai, Indiana Jones and his pal Wu Han (masquerading as a waiter) encounter crime boss Lao Che, who is seeking the remains of Nurhachi, an ancient emperor from the Ming Dynasty. When the deal goes down, Che tries to poison Indy, but chaos ensues, leading to a running gun battle and pursuit by Lao Che and his henchmen, a chase that sweeps up local torch singer Wilhemina ""Willie"" Scott. The getaway car is driven by Indiana's ward and sidekick, Short Round, a 10 year old Chinese boy with a cocky personality. At the nearby Nang Tao airport, Indiana escapes from Shanghai aboard a cargo plane -- though he fails to see that the plane belongs to Lao Che himself.En route to India, their plane crashes in the mountains, when the pilot and co-pilot bail out after dumping the plane's fuel. After a dangerous ride down the Himalayan mountains and a raging river in an inflatable life raft, the trio eventually come to a desolate village in India. The poor villagers enlist their help in retrieving a sacred Shiva lingam stone from the evil forces of nearby Pankot Palace. When the stone was stolen, the village's crops burned and the people began to starve. The forces of Pankot also kidnapped all of the children in the village. At night, Indy finds a small boy, one of the missing children, who has wandered back to the village. In his hand is a piece of cloth with Sanskrit. The writing gives Indy a new clue about the missing Shankara stones. Indy hypothesizes that the stone may be one of the fabled Adi Shankara Stones. The village's elder believes Shiva sent Indiana to retrieve the object.At Pankot palace, the travelers are met by the maharajah's major domo, Chattar Lal and also meet the local British regiment leader, Captain Blumburtt. At a dinner of gruesome cuisine with the maharajah himself, Indy questions Lal about the villagers claims. Lal at first dismisses them, calling them superstition. Indy also brings up the history of the area, stating that it was once the center for a fanatical religious cult, the thuggee, who worshiped the Hindu god Kali. Lal becomes angrier when Indy claims that the sacred stone was stolen from the village and points out several instances of Indy's own lack of discretion and moral judgement while seeking other treasures from different parts of the world. The Maharajah weighs in, saying he's ashamed of the thuggee's history in his region. Indy apologizes for his indiscretion.Later that night Indy is attacked in his room by a would-be assassin, which leads him, Willie and Short Round to discover an underground temple beneath Pankot. They find a Thuggee group, practicing an ancient ritual of black magic and human sacrifice to Kali. Though they possess three of the ancient stones, one of which belongs to the village, they are still missing two and the Thuggee have enslaved the village children to dig for two last stones within the mines of the palace. Mola Ram, the cult's villainous high priest, hopes to use the power of five united stones to rule the world. The protagonists witness a ritual in which Mola Ram bare-handedly digs a man's heart out of his chest. The man survives, his heart beating in Mola Ram's hand, until he is lowered slowly into a lava pit, causing the beating heart to burst into flames. Indy leaves Willie and Shorty behind to retrieve the Sankara stones. As he collects them, he hears a child's cry coming from behind the chamber's statue of Kali. While Willie wonders why Indy is walking off, a thuggee guard surprises them and she and Shorty are captured.Indy finds a large excavation site behind the sacrificial chamber where kids are being forced to work. They're being beaten and whipped. Enraged, Indy throws a rock at one of the guards and is captured. In a small holding cell, a young boy from the village tells Indy that some of the kids are forced to drink the blood of Kali, a potion that makes them unquestioningly obedient to Mola Ram.Indy is forced to drink the blood of Kali and stands at Mola Ram's side when Willie is offered as a human sacrifice. Short Round is put in the mines alongside the village children as a slave laborer. Short Round frees himself and escapes back into the temple, where Willie is about to be sacrificed to Kali. Desperate to help his friend, he burns Indy with a torch, shocking him out of the trance. Together, Shorty and Indy take out Mola Ram's guards and free Willie. Indy makes a silent apology to Shorty. Willie suggests they escape. Indy says ""Right. ALL of us."" and the three go to the mine to free Ram's child slaves. In the fight to escape the palace, the three jump into a mine cart and are closely pursued by two Thuggee-filled carts through the tunnels. They manage to throw off their pursuers. Back in the mine, Mola Ram has his men topple a large water tower, spilling it's contents into the tunnel. Indy and his group barely manage to escape the rush of water, emerging on the stone wall of a canyon.Indy, Willie and Short Round try to cross a rope bridge across the canyon, but are hemmed in by Mola Ram and the Thuggee on both ends. Indy tells his friends to brace themselves and uses a machete to cut the bridge in half. Many of the Thuggee are sent plummeting into the crocodile-infested river where they are eaten, but Mola Ram holds on. In a final battle for the stones, the evil priest declares that they belong to him. Unafraid, Indiana invokes the name of Shiva, yelling that Ram had betrayed the Hindu god. In Indy's satchel, the stones begin to glow and burn a hole through the bag. Two of them fall into the river. The final stone burns Mola Ram's hand as he grabs it. Indiana catches it and watches as Ram falls and is eaten by crocodiles in the river below. Jones climbs up the bridge as Blumburtt and his Indian riflemen help defeat the Thuggee reinforcements. Indiana, Willie, and Short Round return to the village with their sacred stone and the missing children. Indiana tells the village elder he ""understands its [the stone's] power now""."
Gremlins,1984,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087363/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A young man inadvertently breaks three important rules concerning his new pet and unleashes a horde of malevolently mischievous monsters on a small town. Minature green monsters tear through the small town of Kingston Falls. Hijinks ensue as a mild-mannered bank teller releases these hideous loonies after gaining a new pet and violating two of three simple rules: No water (violated), no food after midnight (violated), and no bright light. Hilarious mayhem and destruction in a town straight out of Norman Rockwell. So, when your washing machine blows up or your TV goes on the fritz, before you call the repair man, turn on all the lights and look under all the beds. 'Cause you never can tell, there just might be a gremlin in your house.—Amazon When Billy Peltzer is given a small creature called a Mogwai by his father, he is unaware of the carnage he is about to encounter. There is a huge responsibility in looking after Gizmo as there are certain rules which must be followed. The Mogwai must be kept away from bright light, never made wet and never, ever be fed after midnight. When an accident occurs involving Gizmo and water, the next evolution stage of the Mogwai appears, and it isn't nice at all.—Film_Fan While looking for the perfect Christmas present for his teenage son Billy, Randall Peltzer stumbles upon the ideal companion, a furry Mogwai. However, the otherwise sweet pet comes with a warning: should its unwise owner break the three fundamental guidelines of owning such an exotic creature, all hell will break loose. And when Billy disregards the strict rules, destruction is at hand. But now, there is no turning back. Can the unsuspecting inhabitants of Kingston Falls escape the endless Yuletide nightmare and the horrifying Gremlin menace?—Nick Riganas Sure, he's cute. Of course you can keep him. But heed these three warnings: Don't ever get him wet. Keep him away from bright light. And the most important thing, the one thing you must never forget: no matter how much he cries, no matter how much he begs . . . never, never feed him after midnight. With these mysterious instructions, young Billy Peltzer takes possession of his cuddly new pet. He gets a whole lot more than he bargained for.—Official DVD cover Kingston Falls is a small, economically depressed town in the northeastern U.S. that had been hit hard by the loss of jobs in the 70s and 80s. Many of the people were out of work. One such person was Rand Peltzer, a middle-aged man who we see in Chinatown in New York looking for a Christmas present for his son Billy as the movie opens. Rand had become an inventor of dubious skills. He made a little money selling his usually-unreliable inventions, but it was Billy, who had a job as a bank teller, who was keeping the family just barely above water.
Rand hoped to sell one of his inventions to the proprietor of a junk store in Chinatown, Mr. Wing,, but he became interested in a little furry creature he found in the back. The elderly proprietor refused to sell the creature, citing the great responsibility required with the creature, but his teenage grandson, knowing that their family also was desperate for money, sold the creature to Rand without his grandfather's knowledge or consent. The boy told Rand three important rules for care of the creature, but did not elaborate on why they were important.We then meet Billy, who can't get his car started one cold December morning. He gives up after awhile, and talks to his friend Pete, and then to another family friend, Mr. Futterman, who had also lost his job some while back. Mr. Futterman knows that American goods, which he produced a few years earlier, are built like a tank and the best in the world, and he is highly distrustful of cheaper, lower-quality imports (including Billy's car) that cost him his job. Billy goes to his job at the bank on foot, his dog Barney in tow, and just barely makes it on time.While he is at work, he is visited by Mrs. Deagle, a bitter, mean-spirited old woman who owns much property in town, and her stranglehold on it exacerbates many of the people's financial distress. Mrs. Deagle tells Billy that his dog destroyed one of her lawn ornaments, but would rather have the dog put down than be paid for the damages. The dog, sensing that something is up, jumps out from under Billy's desk and frightens Mrs. Deagle. The bank manager, Mr. Corbin, yells at Billy for bringing his dog to work, but lets him keep his job.After work, Billy stops by the bar, where he sees one of his co-workers, Kate, whom he is interested in romantically, has a part time side job at the bar. He returns home and talks to his mother, just before his father Rand, gets home from his trip to Chinatown. Rand has the creature, a ""mogwai"", which he has named Gizmo, and since a living creature can't wait until Christmas, Rand gives him the present a few days early. After the flash from a camera frightens the creature, Rand remembers to tell his son the three rules: The creature did not like bright light and would be killed by sunlight. They must never give the creature any water, either to drink or a bath. And they must never feed it after midnight.The next day, Billy sees his friend Pete again, and they play with Gizmo, but Pete accidentally knocks over a glass of water and gets Gizmo wet. Gizmo goes into convulsions and five tiny furballs pop out of his back. The furballs grow, and a few minutes later, they develop into creatures just like Gizmo: he has reproduced. He goes to tell his father about it, and his father immediately starts thinking about how he might make money selling them. Pete wants to take a creature home, but Billy thought it best to take one to the local school and have the science teacher examine it first. Once there, he puts a single drop of water on the creature, and one new creature emerges. The teacher, fascinated, keeps it for examination, and Billy leaves.Billy discovers that the new creatures' personalities are markedly different from Gizmo's. Gizmo is friendly and playful, but the new creatures are mean, nasty, and destructive. One of them has a white mohawk, which Billy names Stripe, is the leader of the new pack. Stripe tries to bite Billy's hand when he goes to pet it. That evening, Billy finds his dog Barney hanging from some Christmas lights outside. He immediately suspects Mrs. Deagle, but there were no footprints anywhere outside. Rand tells Billy that he would take Barney with him when he goes to an upcoming inventors' convention, where he hoped to peddle his wares some more.Later, Billy stops by the bar again, and sees Kate persuade a very drunk, dejected Mr. Futterman to walk home instead of driving. Billy walks Kate home, and on the way, she tells him that she dislikes Christmas, but gets defensive when he asks why. Just as they arrive at Kate's place, Billy asks her out, and she accepts.
That night, Billy is reading and the creatures are clamoring to be fed. He looks over at the clock: it's 11:35, so Billy goes and gets the creatures some fried chicken, which all the creatures devour, except Gizmo, who refuses. Meanwhile, at the school, the science teacher antagonizes the creature in his care by performing blood tests on it. After working well into the night, the teacher leaves around 2:20 a.m. He left half a sandwich on the table, which the creature can reach from his cage, and eats it.The next day is Christmas Eve. In the morning, Rand has left with Barney for the convention. Billy asks his mother to come upstairs and look. All of the creatures have disappeared, except Gizmo. They have been replaced by soccer-ball sized cocoons, which appear inert. His mother asks if he fed them after midnight, and Billy looks over at the clock - which still reads 11:35. He checks it and discovers that the wires were deliberately chewed up, so it really was after midnight when he fed them. Oops!In the afternoon, Rand Peltzer calls home from the convention. It was out of his league, the inventors there are far more advanced than he was, so he was going to come home early, and would be in late that night. Meanwhile, Billy and Pete meet the science teacher at the school, where the creature there has undergone a similar transformation. The teacher refers to it as the pupal stage. Afterward, the bell rings and the teacher wishes his departing students a merry Christmas and he would see them after winter break. Just around that time, the cocoons start to hatch. At the Peltzer house, a terrified Gizmo takes refuge inside a football helmet. The teacher calls Billy at the bank, telling him ""they've hatched"", and Billy, who is just getting off work, runs to the school. There he finds that the creature has killed the teacher and shoved his syringe (from the blood tests) into his butt. Immediately alarmed, he reaches for the phone, but a clawed hand rises up and bats him away. He follows the creature throughout the building, and gets his first look at the now vaguely-reptilian creature when it takes another swipe at him. It isn't much bigger than before, but is even more malicious, and has teeth and razor-sharp claws with which to cause havoc. The creature escapes.Meanwhile, at the Peltzer house, the creatures have pulled Gizmo from his hiding place and are busy torturing him. Billy's mother hears sounds upstairs, and goes up with a knife to investigate. She finds nothing except the five hatched cocoons. Just then, Billy calls her from the school, warning her to leave the house immediately, but one of the creatures disconnects the phone line. Then she hears noises downstairs, goes to investigate and sees the creatures making a mess of the place. Using household items, she kills the creatures one at a time. One of them was eating out of the blender, and she switched it on, killing it. She used cooking spray to make another one retreat into the microwave, which she switched on, causing it to explode. She stabbed a third on the kitchen counter. The fourth one was hiding in the Christmas tree, and it attacked. Billy, who had just run from the school, arrived home and grabbed a sword and killed this creature, sending it headlong into the fireplace. The fifth creature, the one with the mohawk, escaped from the house.Billy grabbed Gizmo and they tracked the creature to the YMCA, where it had broken in. The creature takes another swipe at him, and Billy is just in time to see it jump into the pool, multiplying. Billy, now hopelessly outnumbered, retreats from the YMCA; a few minutes later, thousands of little gremlins emerge.
Billy returns home and takes his mother to see a doctor, for the wounds inflicted by the fourth gremlin. Then he goes to the police station and tries to get the cops to take action, or at least warn people, but the cops think he is drunk. They refuse to do anything. The first calls are coming in about freak accidents and fires caused by the gremlins, and the cops go out to check things out, leaving Billy alone.The gremlins are busy little creatures, and set out to destroy as much as they can. They injure a man who is putting mail in a mailbox, tamper with the electrical grid causing sparks to fly and lights to go on and off all over town. They cause car wrecks by making all the lights at an intersection green. They kill Mrs. Deagle by tampering with her stair-lift, making it go so fast it flings her out an upstairs window. They get into the Futterman's snowplow and use it to demolish half of his house, and they disable the brakes on the police car, so when the cops are going to the Futtermans', they wreck their car. Pete manages to keep the gremlins at bay from his bedroom window.Billy gets in his unreliable car, and this time it starts without any problem. He goes to the bar to check on Kate, who is being held hostage by the gremlins. The gremlins have occupied the bar and are drinking beer, getting drunk, playing cards (and cheating and being caught), breakdancing, playing with the ceiling fans, and tearing stuff up as best as they can. Kate notices that they shrink away from her matches when she tries to light their cigarettes. Quick on the uptake, she picks up a camera and takes their picture, the flash each time making them cringe. She gets to the door, but is confronted by another gremlin wearing sunglasses and holding a gun. Even this gremlin is forced to retreat when the glare of Billy's headlights illuminates the bar's front window. Kate leaves with Billy. Meanwhile, Rand Peltzer is still on his way home. He stops at a gas station to call home again, but can't get through (the line is out). He does manage to bring in a little money by selling one of his inventions, a smokeless ashtray (which actually billows smoke) to the attendant. Barney barks at him, which irritates him - they still have a long drive ahead of them.This time, the car doesn't start, so they have to run for it. They go to the bank, only to find that it too has been vandalized by the gremlins. They can hear small explosions in the distance. Kate says that now she has two reasons to dislike Christmas, and this time she tells Billy the first reason. When she was a little girl, her father disappeared without a trace on Christmas Eve. He didn't turn up on Christmas, either. He was discovered dead several days later in their chimney, where he was dressed as Santa Claus. He had been hoping to surprise Kate, but had slipped and broken his neck, and his body got stuck there.After telling this story, they notice that calm has returned to the town, and all the lights are on. Figuring they must all be some place dark, they go to the local movie theater, where, sure enough, all the gremlins are inside watching ""Snow White"", and loving it. They go to the cellar and turn on the gas, and leave some burning newspapers and towels, intending to destroy the building with the creatures inside it. Just as they're leaving, the gremlins detect their presence, and go after them. Kate and Billy, who still has Gizmo, flee through the back door with the gremlins in hot pursuit, and they manage to barricade the door, trapping the gremlins inside. After a few minutes, the gas leak causes an explosion, and all the gremlins are killed.Not all of them! Kate spots one survivor, Stripe, in the window of a Montgomery Ward's department store. He had left the theater briefly to obtain food, and saw the explosion. Determined not to let Stripe escape, Billy and Kate break into the store. Billy takes a bat and goes to look for Stripe, while Kate gets into the back rooms and starts looking for anything useful, such as lights.Stripe uses items he finds in the store to attack Billy - a tennis ball launcher, a small crossbow, and later, a chainsaw. Kate, in the back room, finds a set of circuit breakers and starts turning stuff on randomly - the background music system, some lights, and a water fountain. Billy is using the bat to defend himself from Stripe's chainsaw when the lights come on, distracting Stripe, who has to retreat.By this time, the first light of dawn is visible in the east. It's Christmas morning. Rand and the dog are finally getting back into town, but Barney barks at the broken window of the store and jumps out of the car and into the store. A cranky Rand parks the car and follows him.Gizmo has left Billy's backpack and is now roaming the store, and he and Barney meet once more. Gizmo has found a toy car to drive around. They finally locate Stripe, who has discovered the water fountain, and also found Montgomery Ward's gun sale counter. Billy rushes into the garden area, with the fountain, only to find Stripe poised to reproduce again. Stripe shoots the gun, but misses. It's Gizmo to the rescue as he drives his toy car up a leaning shovel, flying through the air and striking the window shades. One of the shades rolled up all the way to the top, letting in streaming sunlight directly onto Stripe, killing it. As Billy watches, Stripe melts in a puddle of gunk and falls into the water.Kate and Rand arrive in the room and see the mess. Stripe's decaying body jumps out of the fountain for one last scare, but he can't handle the sunlight, and collapses. They all return home.In the evening, the Peltzers are watching the news about the destruction, where it is described as a series of unexplained accidents and fires. They are confronted by the owner of the Chinese junk shop, proven once again to be the only person who can be trusted to properly take care of and contain the Mogwai, who knew exactly where to go once he heard the news. The Chinese man can barely conceal his disgust for television and Western society in general, as demonstrated by that family's carelessness causing the destructive gremlin infestation. Mr. Wing returns Rand's $200, and takes Gizmo back with him, but before he goes, he tells Billy that one day, he might be ready to become the creature's caretaker.The movie ends with Rand's voice telling viewers that if they have any unexplained electrical or mechanical problems, they should be alert for gremlins."
The Karate Kid,1984,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087538/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A martial arts master agrees to teach karate to a bullied teenager. California, 1984. Having left Newark's cold winters behind him, shy Daniel LaRusso moves with his widowed mother to the Reseda neighbourhood in sunny Los Angeles. But Daniel must find his feet. Of course, fitting in is easier said than done. And as if new beginnings weren't challenging enough, a vicious gang of local karate bullies have set their sights on making life miserable for the young newcomer, in and out of school. With no one to turn to for advice, Daniel has a pivotal encounter with Mr Miyagi, the building's inscrutable caretaker and unexpected master martial arts mentor. As the grizzled Karate expert takes Daniel under his wing, the teacher and student embark on a life-changing journey of friendship and self-discovery. However, does the inexperienced LaRusso and Mr Miyagi's compassionate Okinawan defence style stand a chance against Cobra Kai Dojo's brutal Johnny Lawrence, the two-time winner of the All Valley Under-18 Golden Trophy?—Nick Riganas Daniel LaRusso has just moved from New Jersey to Reseda, CA (a neighborhood in Los Angeles) and is finding it hard to acclimatise to life in the new city. He is promised a swimming pool and a beautiful house, but when they get there, it's anything but nice. He meets a beautiful blond girl, but encounters a gang of bullies who make his life a living hell. This further dampens Daniel's spirit as he just wants to go home. He is continually bullied and is afraid to show his face around the high school. He then meets mentor/handyman Mr. Miyagi who takes the naive Daniel under his wing and shows him that Karate and life aren't all about power and strength. It's something deep within you're soul that makes you what you are. Daniel is the underdog and faces the biggest challenge of his life. WIN and he can rejoice forever knowing he beat the bullies. LOSE? They'll never let him forget it.—James Phillips Daniel is new in town, and is getting picked on by the local bullies, who all are adept in karate. Determined to stick up for himself, Daniel begins to teach himself karate, only to discover that the caretaker at his apartment seems to be a grand master in karate. Agreeing to teach Daniel, Mr. Miyagi shows Daniel that there is more to karate than violence, and perhaps the best way to solve the problem he has with the bullies is in the All Valley Karate Championship.—Murray Chapman <muzzle@cs.uq.oz.au> Meet Daniel Larusso, a mild-mannered New Jersey teenager who has to move from his native state to Los Angeles, California when his mother was offered a job there. He thought that he was going to have a nice house with a pool, then he finds out that his new home is a crummy apartment. He tries to fit into the Californian crowd, what he finds is a nice girl from his new high school, and punks (of a karate school named the Cobra Kai) who want to make his life miserable. Then, a Japanese handyman named Keusuke Miyagi comes to aid Daniel. He asked Miyagi to teach him karate, which he does (in a roundabout way). Daniel and Miyagi then developed a great relationship and he wanted to teach the karate fighting punks a lesson, so he signs up for a karate tournament. Daniel is determined to win.—John Wiggins Daniel LaRusso (Ralph Macchio) is a teenager who moves from New Jersey to Los Angeles after his widowed mother, Lucille (Randee Heller), gets a new job. Daniel is unhappy at having to move, make new friends and leave his old friends behind, but he promises Lucille he'll do his best to make a new life in California. Daniel quickly makes a new friend, Freddy Fernandez (Israel Juarbe) at the apartment complex. When the faucet at their new apartment breaks, Daniel goes to see the maintenance man, Mr. Miyagi (Pat Morita), who is attempting to catch a fly with chopsticks. He seems annoyed at being interrupted but assures he will get to them in due time.Freddy invites Daniel to a beach party where he spots a beautiful blonde named Ali Mills (Elisabeth Shue). As the sun goes down, local troublemaker Johnny Lawrence (William Zabka) and his flunkies, Tommy (Rob Garrison) and Bobby Brown (Ron Thomas), crash the party on their motorcycles. After menacingly circling around their bonfire a few times, Johnny dismounts and argues with Ali, revealed to be his ex-girlfriend. He destroys her stereo, prompting Daniel to stand up to him. Johnny quickly reveals that he knows martial arts, and he easily beats up Daniel, giving him a black eye. Daniel is humiliated and refuses Ali's help when she seems concerned. He attempts to hide the eye injury from Lucille by wearing sunglasses to school; when this fails, he lies and tells her that he fell off his bicycle. Daniel receives further humiliation during the soccer tryouts at his new school, when Bobby slide tackles Daniel, prompting Daniel to tackle him and land a punch to his face, which gets him expelled from the field.Although Daniel has some basic knowledge of martial arts via some YMCA self-defense classes, he decides he needs a refresher. While he exercises, Miyagi comes in to fix the sink and comments on Daniel's attempts to learn from a book. He also inquires how Daniel could fall off a bicycle without sustaining any injuries to his arm. When Daniel meets Lucille for lunch he notices a karate school, the Cobra Kai dojo, across the street from the restaurant, and decides to check it out after Lucille returns to work. The dojo's sensei, an ex-Special Forces Vietnam Veteran by the name of John Kreese (Martin Kove), runs the dojo like a boot camp, instilling his students with a Draconian philosophy he refers to as ""the Way of the Fist"", which emphasizes ruthlessness, ferocity, and no mercy. When he sees Johnny, Tommy, and Bobby among Kreese's students, he nervously leaves.While riding home that night on his bike, Johnny and his friends sideswipe Daniel on their motorbikes, causing him to fall down a hill. Daniel is mildly injured but more scared and humiliated. Arriving back at home, Lucille sees him tossing his wrecked bike in a dumpster. Daniel, angry at how his life has been disrupted with the move, tells his mother he wants to move back to New Jersey. As they walk away, Miyagi emerges from his workshop, having heard their conversation.The next day, Daniel finds his bike out of the dumpster and repaired. He goes to Miyagi's workshop and finds out that Miyagi had repaired it for him. Miyagi is also pruning bonsai trees and invites Daniel to try it. Daniel is resistant but Miyagi convinces him that it's a relaxing hobby. Miyagi also shares some of his own personal history with Daniel: he learned about pruning bonsai trees from this father while living in his home town of Okinawa, Japan.Ali and Daniel both decorate the school gymnasium for an upcoming Halloween dance. Daniel, however, chooses not to attend; when Miyagi asks him why, Daniel says he doesn't have a costume. Miyagi also senses that Daniel lacks confidence in himself, and fashions a costume for Daniel consisting of a shower head and curtain. Daniel arrives at the school and meets with Ali, dancing briefly with her. A prankster at the dance smashes a raw egg on Daniel's head and he goes to the bathroom to clean up. Johnny is in one of the stalls, dressed like a skeleton (the other Cobra Kai are as well) and rolling marijuana joints. Daniel rigs a prank, dangling a hose over Johnny and turning on the water, dousing his enemy. Johnny rushes out of the bathroom after Daniel. Ali briefly stalls them by tripping Johnny and spilling all the other Cobra Kais to the floor.Daniel rushes out of the school and nearly makes it over the fence at his home when the Kais catch him and begin to beat him seriously. Yelling about how enemies deserve ""no mercy"", Johnny winds up for a brutal kick and misses when Miyagi appears and pushes Daniel out of the way. The Kais attack Miyagi, who easily defeats them, including Johnny. Leaving them all on the ground and writhing in pain, Miyagi takes Daniel to his workshop and places a medicinal bandanna on his head and gives him strong tea to drink. Daniel is amazed that an older man is skilled in karate and asks Miyagi to teach him. Miyagi mentions that the Kais' problem is not their own doing but must be their teacher's. Miyagi suggests that Daniel talk to their teacher; Daniel refuses, thinking he'll be beaten again. Miyagi is reluctant to get involved but agrees to teach Daniel and also agrees to go with him to Cobra Kai and speak with Kreese.At the Cobra Kai dojo the next day, Daniel and Miyagi watch as Kreese lectures his students that an opponent is also the enemy and deserves no mercy. When Johnny notices that Daniel and Miyagi are in the room, Kreese interrupts his class and confronts the visitors. Kreese scornfully dismisses Miyagi's request that his students leave Daniel alone and orders Daniel to fight Johnny immediately. Miyagi wants the odds to be more even for Daniel and suggests that Daniel and the Kais match up at the All-Valley Karate tournament a few weeks from then. Kreese likes the challenge and agrees. Kreese also agrees to order his students not to touch Daniel until then, but warns that if Daniel does not show up at the tournament, the harassment will be allowed to resume, which will then include Miyagi.Miyagi takes Daniel to his home to begin his training. Out in front of the house are a dozen classic American cars. Miyagi tells Daniel that they'll have to make a pact: Miyagi will instruct Daniel and his student will not question his method. When Daniel agrees, Miyagi hands Daniel a sponge and orders him to wash and wax all the cars. Miyagi's instructions are very specific; Daniel will only use the sponge and waxing cloths by moving his hands and arms in wide circles. He will also breathe deeply, in through his nose & out through his mouth. In the weeks that follow, Miyagi gives Daniel further chores to complete with similar instructions on technique: sanding a walkway that leads around Miyagi's backyard (landscaped to be a Japanese garden), staining the fence that surrounds his property and painting his house.With each new chore, Daniel's frustration grows at the seeming lack of any karate training and Miyagi's minimal praise of his work. One night, after finishing the painting of Miyagi's house, Daniel expresses his frustration to his teacher. Miyagi tells Daniel to show him how he washed and polished the cars. When Daniel tells him his shoulder aches too much, Miyagi uses acupressure to relieve the tension and orders Daniel to show him the motions he'd been using to do the chores. Daniel quickly realizes that the chores (which are essentially Daniel's ""fee"" for the lessons) were also practice for defensive moves, exercises to build muscle tone, his reflexes and proper breathing technique. After a few minutes of practice, Miyagi suddenly yells and throws several punches and kicks at Daniel, all of which Daniel blocks easily. Miyagi also shows Daniel how to bow to his opponent, making sure Daniel looks his opponent in the eye, both for defense and to convey respect.Daniel goes on his first official date with Ali. When he arrives, driven by Lucille, at Ali's house, he finds that her parents are quite wealthy and live in Beverly Hills. Daniel is incredibly nervous and embarrassed, especially when Lucille's car won't start and they have to push-start it. However, the date with Ali is enjoyable and his embarrassment melts.In the weeks that follow, Miyagi has Daniel work on his defensive techniques and learn physical balance by standing on the beach and trying to stay upright against the large strong waves of the ocean. When Daniel comes out of the water, he sees Miyagi standing on a post down the beach. Miyagi is practicing a move where he lifts his arms and one leg, but kicks with the other. When Daniel asks him what the move is Miyagi calls it the ""crane technique"" saying that if it's performed properly, an opponent will have no defense. Back at Miyagi's pickup truck, there are a couple of drunken men who have placed their empty beer bottles on the fender. Miyagi politely asks them to take them off. When the men refuse and insult Miyagi's Japanese heritage, Miyagi suddenly chops the tops of the bottles with a slice of his bare hand. The men quickly remove the bottles.Ali asks Daniel to meet her for another date. Daniel goes to Ali's parents country club where he sees Ali dancing with Johnny. When Johnny spots Daniel, he forces Ali to kiss him. Daniel, ashamed, goes to leave and runs into a waiter, who spills a tray of food on him, drawing laughter from everyone who sees the accident. Ali, furious, punches Johnny and leaves, which Daniel does not see happen.Later that night, at Miyagi's house, Daniel finds him drunk and dressed in an Army sergeant's uniform. Miyagi shows Daniel a picture of his late wife and has Daniel drink a toast with him. After a few minutes, Miyagi passes out in his bed and Daniel covers him with a blanket. Daniel finds an Army document stating that Miyagi's wife and child had died during birth at the Manzanar relocation camp for Japanese Americans in California. Daniel also discovers that Miyagi is a war hero, having been awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor. Before leaving, Daniel bows to his teacher.More time passes and Daniel continues to train, often alone. He also practices Miyagi's crane kick at the beach. Miyagi also teaches Daniel how to punch, harshly reprimanding Daniel when the boy begins to goof off.Daniel's 16th birthday comes around and he has cake and ice cream with Miyagi. He has also passed his driver's test. Miyagi gives Daniel a Japanese robe with an embroidered bonsai tree sewn into the back. Miyagi's other present is one of the cars he had Daniel wash and wax, a yellow 1948 Ford Super Deluxe. He tells Daniel to go out and find the ""balance"" in his life; realizing that he has confidence and to pursue his relationship with Ali. Daniel drives to a local hangout and finds Ali, intending to confront her about kissing Johnny. She mostly ignores him until Ali's friend Susan explains that Johnny had kissed her only to humiliate Daniel and that Ali had hurt her wrist while punching Johnny for that affront. Daniel apologizes to Ali and she accepts. He takes her out for a drive in his new car.On the day of the tournament, Ali and Lucille join him. At the registration desk the official asks what degree of belt Daniel has attained. Miyagi tells the official that Daniel is a black belt and slyly steals the official's belt from his bag sitting beside the desk, giving it to Ali. In the locker room while dressing, Daniel is confronted by some of the Cobra Kais led by Dutch, one of Kreese's top-ranking students,. One of the referees orders the Kais out.In the tourney ring, Daniel squares off and beats his first opponent. He continues to advance, much to his own surprise. In the higher rounds, Daniel faces off against some of the Cobra Kais. When Daniel defeats Tommy and Dutch, Kreese orders Bobby to use an illegal kick to deliberately injure Daniel's knee, taking him out of the competition. Though disgusted, Bobby complies, severely injuring Daniel and getting disqualified in the process. Daniel is taken to the locker room where a medic tells him he won't be able to finish the competition. Daniel is devastated, but Ali, Lucille, and Miyagi all tell him that he made his point, and further fighting isn't necessary. However, after both women have left, Daniel asks Miyagi to use acupressure to fix his knee, like he did for his shoulder during training. Though Miyagi initially reiterates Lucille's comments that Daniel has nothing left to prove, Daniel insists he will never be able to achieve his life's balance if he knows his tormentors have gotten the best of him. Miyagi agrees and partially heals Daniel's leg.Daniel returns to the ring moments before Johnny is about to be named winner by default. Needing three contact points to win, both square off and after several tense rounds the score is tied at two each. Daniel tries a high kick which is caught by Johnny, who, under orders from Kreese, plants an elbow in Daniel's injured knee. Daniel, despite being in pain, is undeterred and lines up for the final round. He takes up the crane technique pose and with an approving look from Miyagi, waits for Johnny to make his move. Daniel kicks out with his leg and connects with Johnny's chin, scoring a third point and winning the match and title. As he's carried around on the shoulders of the other competitors, Johnny congratulates him and hands him the championship trophy. Daniel celebrates his triumph and sees Miyagi nearly smiling."
Police Academy,1984,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087928/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A group of good-hearted, but incompetent misfits enter the police academy, but the instructors there are not going to put up with their pranks. In desperate need of a fresh batch of police officers, the newly appointed Lady Mayoress of a crime-plagued metropolis lowers the bar for the recruitment process. As a result, all types of misfits start flocking into Commandant Eric Lassard's prestigious Police Academy, and the leader of this assortment of pariahs is Carey Mahoney: a light-hearted, devil-may-care young rebel. But now, there is no turning back, and to make matters worse, the autocratic martinet, Lieutenant Harris, can't wait to see them quit. Then, a full-scale riot breaks out, and the inexperienced but dauntless cadets will have to put their training to good use. Do they have what it takes to be law-enforcement officers?—Nick Riganas The newly elected mayor Mary Sue Beal changes the hiring practices of an unnamed city's police, ending age-old discriminatory policies. Hundreds of people apply for training in the Metropolitan Police Academy, many of which would be considered unfit by previous standards. The Academy is no longer able to reject them. The police chief Hurnst is a reactionary who would prefer all officers to have ""the right color"" (white) and right gender (male). He instructs commandant Eric Lassard and lieutenant Thaddeus Harris to pressure ""undesirable"" cadets into quitting their training. Lassard is reluctant, but Harris is enthusiastic about the plan. Harris convinces cadets Chad Copeland and Kyle Blankes to make life miserable for their fellow cadets until the plan succeeds. Some misfit cadets have to shape up to stay in the Academy. The entire graduating class gets their baptism of fire when called to face angry rioters.—Dimos I New rules enforced by the Lady Mayoress mean that sex, weight, height and intelligence need no longer be a factor for joining the Police Force. This opens the floodgates for all and sundry to enter the Police Academy, much to the chagrin of the instructors. Not everyone is there through choice, though. Social misfit Mahoney has been forced to sign up as the only alternative to a jail sentence and it doesn't take long before he falls foul of the boorish Lieutenant Harris. But before long, Mahoney realises that he is enjoying being a police cadet and decides he wants to stay... while Harris decides he wants Mahoney out!—Rhino <rhino@blueyonder.co.uk> A newly-elected female mayor (referred to as the ""lady mayor"" by her opponents) of an unnamed city has announced a policy requiring the police department to accept all willing recruits, effectively abolishing fitness requirements, educational levels, and medical standards, although not everyone in the police force is happy about the new changes.Carey Mahoney (Steve Guttenburg) is an easy going man who has repeatedly gotten himself in trouble with the law when standing up to arrogance. Mahoney is forced to join the police academy as an alternative to jail; a proposal by Captain Reed who has been lenient on Mahoney due to knowing his late father, who was also a policeman. Mahoney reluctantly agrees to this and decides that he will get himself thrown out as a loophole. However, the chief of police, Commandant Lassard outraged by the mayor's lowered requirements, decides that the new cadets should be forced to quit rather than being thrown out. Lieutenant Thaddeus Harris (G.W. Bailey) the arrogant and thick-headed officer who trains the cadets, agrees with the plan and employs tactics to make their lives as miserable as possible so that they do in fact quit. Mahoney tries many schemes to get thrown out as he cannot quit, as part of the deal made with Captain Reed said if he quit, he was going to be sent to jail. But toward the middle of the film he decides to stay for good having fallen in love with fellow recruit Karen Thompson (Kim Cattrall).While in the academy, Mahoney becomes friends with a group of misfit fellow cadets; the sound-mimicking wizard Larvell Jones (Michael Winslow); the gun-obsessed Eugene Tackleberry (David Graf), and especially Moses Hightower (Bubba Smith), a giant of a man (who is actually quite shy and keeps away from violence by and large), after helping him prepare for the critical driving test. After passing, Hightower is very thankful to Mahoney. Unfortunately, the quit policy does not apply to Hightower, who gets himself kicked out of the academy because of an incident. After his friend and fellow cadet Laverne Hooks has been racially insulted, an angered Hightower lifts and turns over a police car with the hated bullying cadet Copeland inside.Shortly after this, Mahoney gets involved in a lunchroom brawl caused by Copeland and Blankes, and takes the blame for throwing the first punch, which finally gives Lt. Harris the green light to expel his most despised cadet. Before Mahoney actually leaves the premises, however, a major riot breaks out downtown. The resulting police emergency forces the cadets into real action for the first time. During the riot, a tough outlaw manages to steal two cadet revolvers (one from Copeland and the other from Cadet Blankes). The outlaw grabs and disarms Lt. Harris by surprise, taking the officer to the roof of a nearby building as a hostage. Mahoney, despite his past troubles with Harris, dodges gunfire and climbs to the roof in a rescue attempt. This attempt fails and Mahoney is taken as a second hostage. Just as both hostages are about to be killed, it is none other than Hightower who suddenly appears on the rooftop in civilian clothes. The former cadet, who went back to his old job at a nearby florist just minutes earlier and left his shop due to the riot, manages to fool the hostage taker that he is a fellow crook. When asking whom the hostage-taker should shoot first, Hightower points at Harris, before knocking the hostage-taker out with a massive punch, thus rescuing Mahoney and Harris just in time.Mahoney and Hightower both graduate from the academy along with the other passing cadets, and both receive the academy's highest commendation ever bestowed upon a cadet for their rescue of Lt. Harris and capture of his kidnapper. Towards the end Mahoney suddenly stammers as he sees a prostitute concealed inside the podium, and suddenly realizes Commandant Lassard has taken subtle revenge for one of Mahoney's earlier pranks in an attempt to get himself kicked out."

Romancing the Stone,1984,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088011/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A mousy romance novelist sets off for Colombia to ransom her kidnapped sister, and soon finds herself in the middle of a dangerous adventure hunting for treasure with a mercenary rogue. Joan Wilder, a mousy romance novelist, receives a treasure map in the mail from her recently murdered brother-in-law. Meanwhile, her sister Elaine is kidnapped in Colombia and the two criminals responsible demand that she travel to Colombia to exchange the map for her sister. Joan does, and quickly becomes lost in the jungle after being waylayed by Zolo, a vicious and corrupt Colombian cop who will stop at nothing to obtain the map. There, she meets an irreverent soldier-of-fortune named Jack Colton who agrees to bring her back to civilization. Together, they embark upon an adventure that could be straight out of Joan's novels.—Denny Gibbons Talented, still single, and incurably romantic, the famous best-selling romance novelist, Joan Wilder, sees her orderly life turn upside down, when she receives a desperate message from her kidnapped sister and a well-worn treasure map. Under those circumstances and having no other option but to play along, the utterly unprepared adventurer will leave behind New York's urban jungle, only to get involved in a real-life rescue mission deep in the unforgiving rain forests of Colombia, wearing her fashionable ensemble, and her high heels. Now, Joan's only hope of success rests in the capable hands of the handsome and reckless fortune-seeker, Jack Colton, who itches to beat the local mountain bandits at their own game. Will Joan find the romance she's been yearning for in the hot and humid Cartagena?—Nick Riganas New York City based Joan Wilder is a highly successful author of adventure romance novels. She is the polar opposite of Angelina, the heroine in many of her novels. Angelina is a strong, confident woman who uses her sexuality to her advantage and who is swept off her feet by the stories' hero, a man named Jessie. Joan, on the other hand, is afraid of life. She lives vicariously through her stories, and hopes that there is a real life Jessie who will someday sweep her off her feet. Joan's world is turned upside down when she receives news from her sister Elaine in Cartegena, Colombia that she has been kidnapped, the ransom being a treasure map which Elaine's now murdered husband, Eduardo, has since sent to Joan. Unprepared to leave the safety of her New York City apartment, Joan nonetheless travels to Colombia with treasure map in hand to save Elaine. In Colombia, Joan is thrown into the middle of something akin to the adventure part of her novels, not primarily through Cartegena, but inadvertently through the jungles of Colombia. She not only has to face the dangers of the jungle, but Elaine's captors - American illegal treasure hunters, cousins named Ira and Ralph - a Colombian military policeman named Zolo who, with his private army, is also after the treasure, and a bunch of drug runners who are solely trying to protect their way of life. To Joan's rescue - for a fee - is Jack Colton, an American in Colombia who has always taken the ""fast and easy"" way to what he wants in life, which is now enough money to buy a luxury sailboat in which to sail around the world. After Jack learns of the treasure map, he too becomes focused on whatever the unknown treasure - something the cryptic map calls El Corazon - to achieve his goal. Will Jack do whatever he can to get the treasure, even if it ultimately harms Joan and Elaine, or could Jack be Joan's real life Jessie?—Huggo Joan Wilder is a mousey writer of romance novels. She finds a package from her sister mailed from Colombia in her mailbox. A call from her sister tells her that she has been kidnapped and that bringing the package to Colombia is necessary for her safety and release. Being fairly clueless, she leaves for Colombia to rescue her sister. She is lost within hours of her arrival. She is nearly murdered by one of the men searching for the package when Jack Colton, a fairly low life American rescues her. They begin a journey through the jungle with bullets flying nearby. Is Joan up to all of this?

Grogan has come for a treasure of considerable value and demands it and sex from Angelina. As she prepares to undress, she throws a hidden knife at her foe, killing him, proclaiming that Grogan had killed her father, raped and murdered her sister, burned her ranch, shot her dog, and stolen her Bible. After she's dressed, she packs up her horse and rides out, only to stop at the sight of Grogan's men on horseback. Suddenly her hero, Jesse, shown only in shadow, appears and shoots all the men dead. Jesse and Angelina embrace and she says they'll be together forever.The scene shifts to Joan Wilder, an author of bestselling romance novels, crying as she types out the scene she'd just narrated, the finale to her latest book. Joan is happy that she's completed what could be her biggest selling novel yet. In her kitchen, she hears a noise behind her and greets someone she calls ""Sweetheart"" -- it's her cat, Romeo. She gives him a can of Bumblebee tuna to eat and celebrates with him. She looks up at a poster on her wall of Jesse from the cover of one of her books and hopes aloud that she'll one day find a man like the one she's created.Joan leaves her apartment, late for a meeting with her editor, Gloria. On the way, she meets an elderly neighbor who gives her a package that the mail carrier couldn't fit in her box. The package is from her brother-in-law and has arrived from Colombia. At the meeting with Gloria, Joan presents the manuscript. Gloria has had them meet in a bar thinking that it'll be good for Joan to see single men in a social setting. Joan remains reluctant because none of them can match her vision of Jesse. Joan also mentions to Gloria that she'd gotten a package from her brother-in-law, Eduardo, who'd recently been found dead and mutilated in Colombia.In Cartagena, Colombia, Joan's sister, Elaine, is leaving her house in a hurry. Outside, a boy is playing with a bola and as Elaine drives her car out of her garage, the boy throws the bola at her, knocking her unconscious. The boy drives Elaine in her car to a nearby fort where Ralph, an irritable, small-time crook, sees him arrive. He talks to his cousin, Ira, who's feeding a large nest of crocodiles through a grate in the ground, telling him that they should leave Colombia because things have gotten too dangerous. Ira tells Ralph that they have one more treasure hunt to go on, and they'll leave.Joan arrives home to find that her apartment has been ransacked. Earlier, a shady character had been standing at Joan's front door and had killed the building's janitor. Joan finds her cat safe and suddenly gets an unexpected call from Elaine. Elaine, being forced to talk to Joan by Ira and Ralph, sounds upset and asks Joan if she'd gotten the package from Eduardo. Joan finds a treasure map inside. Elaine tells Joan to bring the map to Cartagena. Joan is reluctant, thinking that Colombia is too dangerous. Elaine tells her that Ira and Ralph are plotting to torture her. Joan packs up and leaves her cat with Gloria, who tries to talk her out of going.Joan arrives in Colombia and looks for a bus that'll take her to Cartagena. The shady character that ransacked her apartment, Colonel Zolo, tells her that the bus, which is really going to a remote town in the mountains, will take her to Cartagena and joins her on the bus. Ralph, who came to the airport to follow her, spots Joan on the wrong bus just as it leaves.Joan wakes up on the bus, which is winding its way through a mountain pass surrounded by rainforest. When she asks the driver when they'll arrive, the driver is distracted and crashes into a parked Land Rover. The bus is wrecked and the passengers continue on foot. Zolo tells Joan she can wait for another bus and soon draws a pistol on her, demanding her purse. Just then a man appears at the top of a nearby ridge. Zolo fires a warning shot at the man, who raises his hands and suddenly grabs a shotgun from a scabbard on his back. The two men shoot at each other until Zolo runs out of ammo and retreats. Joan, hiding under the bus, hears the mystery man cursing in English about the wrecked Land Rover and losing a bunch of birds. He eventually finds her hiding under the bus. Still angry about losing his vehicle and the birds he'd been collecting, he acts very callously toward Joan, who asks him to take her to a town with a phone. The man demands $500 and Joan talks him down to $375 in American Express traveler's checks. He also coldly refuses to carry Joan's suitcase.In the meantime, Zolo is picked up by Ralph, who had been following the bus. The two go to the nearest police station where Zolo orders the chief to assemble his men. Ralph nervously calls Ira and tells him where he is, also spotting a police notice with his picture on it. He tears it down just as Ira yells at him to find Joan and get the map she's carrying.Joan and her rescuer continue on foot through the mountains. The man asks Joan if she has anything truly important in her suitcase and callously throws it into a ravine so they can move faster. Joan is furious and about to berate him when the ground beneath her gives way and she falls into the ravine, riding a mudslide. The man watches her for a moment, irritated, and the ground collapses under him as well. The two end up sliding down the side of the hill until they land in a marsh. Soaking wet, the man seems to have enjoyed the ride while Joan sits whimpering. He asks her what her name is and gives her a hearty welcome to Colombia.After they are able to clean themselves up, the man uses his machete to chop the heels off Joan's pumps so she can walk more easily. Suddenly, they are shot at by Zolo and the small police force he's gathered. They take off through the jungle, finally stopping at a deep ravine. There's a bridge across but it's too dilapidated to use. The man plans to fight, while Joan tries desperately to cross the bridge. Halfway across, a plank gives way and, grabbing a large creeper vine, Joan swings across, landing safely on the other side. The man manages to do the same, though his landing is much rougher, narrowly escaping shots from Zolo.The two continue through the jungle, with the man giving Joan the opportunity to learn how to use his machete. She's startled when she finds a wrecked cargo plane with the rotted body of a pilot sticking out of a cockpit window. The two take refuge in the fuselage which is filled with hundreds of pounds of marijuana. Near the dead pilots they find a small bag with food and a bottle of tequila. The man, wanting to build a fire, looks in Joan's purse for matches and finds the map. Also in the pilot's bag is a fairly recent copy of Rolling Stone magazine -- the man is exasperated to find out that the Doobie Brothers had broken up (referring to their first breakup in 1982). Joan is curious and the man tells her that he'd come to Colombia as a mate on a coffee boat but decided to go into catching and selling exotic birds. The man also tells Joan that her sister's life doesn't depend on the map itself -- that the treasure it leads to is more important. The treasure, whatever it is, is called ""El Corazón,"" Spanish for ""The Heart."" He also tells her that it's located in Cordoba province, which they are in the middle of and that if they find it she'll have more to bargain with in freeing her sister. Joan is angry with him for suggesting that they should greedily get the treasure first. When he appears not to be listening, she begins another tirade and he suddenly kills a large snake near her shoulder with his machete. Frightened out of her wits, she asks him if the snake is poisonous. He says it is, but it also makes a tasty meal.Later, while the man explains his business, collecting and selling exotic birds, Joan asks him his name. He tells her it's ""Jack T. Colton."" When she asks him what the T stands for, he tells her ""trustworthy"", one of the characteristics she looks for in a man.The next morning, Joan and Jack arrive in a tiny village. The locals regard them with caution and hostility. At one point they seem ready for a confrontation when Joan politely asks them if there's a car in the village. One of the men tells her that a man named Juan, the bell maker, has a car. Jack, skeptical, correctly believes that Juan is actually a drug dealer who owned the shipment of marijuana in the crashed plane. Jack and Joan go to his house and find the man just as unfriendly as the others. When he points a gun at them both and they find themselves also facing the villagers, Jack lets Joan's full name slip and Juan recognizes her -- she's his favorite author and he reads her books to the local men each week. He invites them both inside where they find he has an elaborate and luxurious home. When they ask him about his car, he's amused saying the vehicle is his ""little mule, Pepe.""Just then, Zolo and his men arrive looking for Joan and Jack. Suddenly, Jack, Joan and Juan all burst out of Juan's garage -- ""Pepe"" is actually Juan's rugged sport-model Ford Bronco. The trio roar out of town with Zolo right behind. They charge through several fields until they head directly for a nearby stream. Juan has set up a ramp that carries them across the stream which he activates with a remote. After they've crossed, he rigs the ramp so that Zolo's men crash into it and are unable to follow them. Some time later, in a field overlooking a nearby town, Jack spots a tree that looks like a pitchfork. It's one of the markers on the map called ""El Tenedor del Diablo"", the Devil's Fork. When they arrive in town, Jack checks them into a hotel and buys some clothes for Joan. He also plans to steal the map and make a copy of it for himself. Also in the town is Ralph, who spots Jack and Joan, and calls his cousin to tell him.At a town festival, Jack and Joan have dinner together and dance. Ralph tries to steal Joan's purse, only to be beaten up by a large woman who thinks he's trying to molest her. Jack and Joan go back to their room and spend the night together in bed. Jack tells Joan he'd like to take her around the world on the sailboat he dreams of buying. Joan suggests they use the map to find the treasure -- Joan is convinced that finding the treasure will give her more leverage to free her sister from Ralph and Ira. They both agree to do it and split the take from the treasure 50/50. Jack surreptitiously puts the map back into her purse.In the morning, sneaking out of the hotel ahead of Zolo, they steal the very car that belongs to Ralph, not knowing he's sleeping the back seat. They follow the map back into the countryside. After finding a small roadside shrine, another of the landmarks, they continue only to stop when the road seems to run out. Joan listens for a bit and hears falling water. She also discovers that the map has a hidden clue: when one corner is folded, it shows the waterfall she heard and an X marking the resting place of the treasure. The two find the waterfall and a cave under it. In the cave is a final clue, a marker saying ""Leche de la Madre"", ""Mother's milk"". Jack spots a small pool under a few white stalactites that drip white-colored water. They dig in that spot for a few minutes and right after Joan tells Jack that she's enjoyed the adventure they've gone on, they find a bundle. In the bundle is a cheap ceramic bunny statue. Jack is frustrated until Joan remembers that in her 1st book the treasure was hidden inside the statue. They break it open and find El Corazon, a large green emerald. Jack quips that they're ""in a lot of trouble"" and Ralph suddenly appears and demands the emerald at gunpoint. Outside the cave, he accuses Jack of sweet-talking Joan into finding the jewel when he really wanted it for himself. Ralph tells them he's going to steal it for himself and tries to leave, only to find that Zolo and his men have found them all. Ralph runs off, but Jack and Joan easily catch him in their car and take the jewel back. Ralph is surrounded by Zolo's mounted men.Jack and Joan continue to race away but end up in the river and tumble over a large waterfall. Both of them surface, but on different sides of the river. The current is too strong, making it impossible to cross. Joan is upset but, as Jack tells her, she still has the map and can still trade it for her sister. He tells her to head for the setting sun and she'll reach Cartagena and that he'll meet her there.Joan arrives in the city and goes to the hotel. She calls Ira, who tells her to meet her at the fort across the bay. Joan goes there and is met by Ira and his men. After seeing that her sister is alive, she hands Ira the map. He looks it over, sees that it's genuine and frees Elaine. As they walk away, a burst from a machine gun stops them. Jack steps out of the shadows; he's been captured by Zolo. Zolo burns the map, telling them it's worthless since the stone has already been found -- among his captives is Ralph, who's been beaten and has likely told Zolo about Jack and Joan's adventure. Questioned by Zolo, Joan lies about having found the stone. Zolo takes Joan to a nearby marsh where Ira had been keeping crocodiles. He slashes her hand and threatens to let her be eaten alive if they don't hand over the stone. Jack tells them its in a safe place and when he keeps silent on the location, one of Zolo's men hits him in the crotch with his rifle butt. Jack then slides the stone out of it's ""hiding place"" and kicks it to Zolo, hoping he'll choke on it. Zolo catches it over the water in the marsh and thanks Jack. A crocodile suddenly bursts up and bites off Zolo's hand, swallowing the stone with it.Jack grabs a machine gun from a guard and opens fire. Ira's men show up and a large gunfight ensues. Ira escapes, leaving Ralph behind. Jack chases after the croc that swallowed the stone, eventually holding it by the tail over a drop into the bay. Joan and Elaine are pursued by Zolo until Joan, having stolen Zolo's stiletto, throws it at him. He quickly blocks the blow with a board and lunges at her, throwing her to the ground. Eventually, she is able to throw him off by grabbing his lit cigar and burning his face and hitting his bloody stump with the wooden board. He lands on a lantern, rises again on fire and lunges for her, missing and falling through the grating into the crocodile pit. Jack, unable to stop the croc from diving into the water, had tried to scale one of the fortress' walls and finally catches up to her. He tells her to go to the American consulate and tell them the whole story -- the Cartagena police are approaching and he doesn't want to be arrested. He dives off the wall after the croc.Some time later, back in New York, Joan is meeting with Gloria. She's written another novel about her experiences and Gloria is ecstatic.

He's not there, so one of the ladies that works there takes down Apollonia's information. After The Revolution is done playing, Morris Day and The Time begin to play, the former having a rivalry with The Kid.The Kid lives at home with his mother (Olga Karlatos) and his father (Clarence Willliams III), a mixed race couple. The father physically abuses the mother, and strikes back at The Kid whenever he tries to defend her.The next day, Morris and the club's owner Billy (Billy Sparks) discuss getting a new group to replace The Revolution since people are getting tired of The Kid's schtick. Morris wants to organize an all-girl group, and Billy appears to be on board.The Kid pursues Apollonia. He takes her for a ride on his motorcycle and rides to a nearby lake, where he tells her he will help her break out if she gets into the water of Lake Minnetonka. Apollonia strips down to her underwear and jumps into the water. The Kid then says that it's not Lake Minnetonka. He gets on his motorcycle and begins to ride away, leaving Apollonia naked and pissed off. However, he stays and lets her climb back on.Two members of The Revolution, the assistant guitarist Wendy (Wendy Melvoin) and keyboardist Lisa (Lisa Coleman), frequently write music for the band and ask The Kid to give it a listen, but he never does and he continues to refuse to use their music, which causes tension between the band. The Kid mocks their sentiments using a puppet.Morris approaches Apollonia to join the girl group. He buys some fancy champagne and tries to convince her that The Kid can't help her kick-start her career since he can hardly get his own career off the ground. As The Kid performs, he watches the two of them sitting together. With The Revolution, he sings ""The Beautiful Ones,"" which brings Apollonia to tears.After the show, The Kid brings Apollonia to his home. He plays a record track in his room that sounds like a woman moaning erotically, but he tells Apollonia that the woman is crying, and he is just playing the track backwards. The Kid then passionately kisses Apollonia and they make love for the first time.A few days later, Morris eventually persuades Apollonia into joining the group. She goes to The Kid's home and gives him the news. He reacts by angrily slapping her the same way his father does to his mother.The Kid learns from Billy that he plans to cut one of the acts for the club. This leads The Kid to go on a motorcycle ride to have time with his thoughts (while ""When Doves Cry"" plays). This is cut between moments of memories he shared with Apollonia. When he returns home, he finds his mother on the front steps crying. He enters his home to confront his father. The Kid finds him in the basement smoking a cigarette and playing the piano.

Billy enters and criticizes him, comparing him to his father and his own failed musical career.Soon, the girl group, Apollonia 6, make their debut at the club. Their song, ""Sex Shooter"", is a hit, and Billy continues to hint at The Kid that they'll be taking his spot. After the show, Apollonia and Morris (who is drunk) are walking together. The Kid comes to get her on his motorcycle once Morris starts to get fresh. They ride by a bridge, where The Kid starts getting aggressive with Apollonia. She leaves him.When The Kid returns home, he sees that the place is a mess, and his mother is gone. He goes down to the basement, and his father attempts suicide by shooting himself in the head with a shotgun, but the wound only grazes his head. The medics take him away. The Kid starts raging out in the basement, whereupon he discovers his father's compositions. The following morning, he picks up a tape of a song that Wendy and Lisa wrote, ""Slow Groove"". It inspires him to start composing.That night, The Time plays their set to a satisfied crowd. After the performance, Morris goes by The Revolution's dressing room and tauntingly asks The Kid, ""How's the family?"" His buddies laugh, but Morris quickly regrets what he said.The Revolution goes up to play. Before the song, The Kid announces that they're playing a song written by Wendy and Lisa, which he dedicates to his father. The song is ""Purple Rain"". It thrills the crowd so much that even Billy sheds a tear. Once the song ends, The Kid goes backstage and plans to hop on his motorcycle, but he hears the enthusiastic cheering and goes back, where the other musicians congratulate him and cheer him on.

Allen Bauer is rescued from drowning as a young boy off Cape Cod by a young mermaid. Years later, he returns to the same location, and once again manages to fall into the sea, and is rescued once more by the mermaid (Allen isn't sure what he has seen and what he has imagined).

Now, unable to resist Madison's strange charm, Allen falls head-over-heels in love with her, unbeknownst to him that she harbours an unexpected secret; one that prevents her from touching saltwater. Can Allen trust Madison, and, above all, will he be able to love her when the truth comes out?—Nick Riganas Alan Bauer nearly drowned as a child but has memories of being saved by a young mermaid.

Unknown to them, Allen has actually seen a little mermaid. However, no one else sees her as Allen is plucked from the water and returned to his parents, much to the sadness of the mermaid as she watches the boat leave.20 years later, Allen (Tom Hanks) now runs his family's produce distribution business, as well as continues his boyish search to find true love. Along with his feelings, Allen must also contend with his lecherous but still caring brother Freddie (John Candy), who takes love a bit less seriously than his brother. Allen lives with his girlfriend but she breaks up with him over the phone, leaving Allen depressed and despondent.After attending the wedding of a work associate (Bobby Di Cicco), Allen gets drunk and for some reason, decides to go to Cape Cod while his brother runs off to Rio de Janeiro with two attractive single women. Arriving at the Cape, Allen comes across a short-tempered scientist named Cornbluth (Eugene Levy), who is there to search for mermaids in the waters off the town (unknown to his two bumbling crewmembers, or Allen).Allen charters a small motorboat to get to a nearby island, but a mishap sends him over the side. After almost drowning, Allen finds himself on land with a beautiful naked blonde woman (Daryl Hannah), who quickly disappears back into the water (once in the water, her legs become fins, unseen to Allen). Allen pleads to know who she is, but she does not respond.In the water, the mermaid finds Allen's wallet, and swims away, but not before having a chance encounter with Cornbluth. After swimming away, she goes to a sunken ship, and using the information in his wallet and some old maps in the sunken ship, finds out where Allen lives.A couple days later, Allen returns to New York, and on the same day, the mermaid shows up naked at the Statue of Liberty, with Allen's wallet. Allen receives a call from the NYPD, and heads to the station where the girl is being held. After she is released into his custody, Allen takes her to his apartment.The next day, Allen shows up for work happier than usual, much to the shock of Freddie, to whom Allen decides to give more of the responsibility of the family business. Upon returning home later in the day, Allen is shocked to find the woman is missing. The doorman claims she got in a cab going to Bloomingdale's, and Allen heads there immediately. He finds her there with a whole new wardrobe, and also finds that she is now able to talk. When Allen asks how, she explains that it was by watching television in the store's electronics department. As they walk home, Allen tries to ask her where she's from, but she is scant on details, only to say that she can only stay for 6 days, before the moon is full. When asking her for a name, the concept seems foreign to the woman. As he notes that they are approaching ""Madison Ave,"" the woman decides she likes this name, and so Allen decides to call her Madison.Allen then spends the next couple days away from work getting to know Madison. One evening, he hears her in the bathroom with the door locked, and the water running. When he asks to be let in, she panics and demands that he wait. Allen instead grows worried when he hears a strange thump on the floor (Madison's legs had transformed in the water and she'd flopped out of the tub), and knocks in the door, finding Madison wrapped in a towel on the floor, claiming she didn't want to let him in because she was ""shy.""The next evening, Allen gets Madison a gift, and takes her out for a walk. When the come across a fountain with a mermaid on it, Allen recounts how it reminds him of something, but can't recall just what.

Allen is impressed, but asks if he can take Madison instead of Freddie along. Freddie playfully teases his brother that he's in love, but Allen insists he's not. Allen goes on to explain that he just isn't sure, and that something just seems strange when it comes to Madison, noting the incident with the TV's as well as the bathroom.Meanwhile, Madison's appearance at the Statue of Liberty has made it into a local tabloid. Cornbluth sees the story, and informs his colleagues in New York. However, one of his colleagues named Dr Ross finds Cornbluth's mermaid theory to be ridiculous. Cornbluth is sure that when she is not in the water, the mermaid's fins become legs on dry land. He then sets out across New York attempting to find Madison and throw water on her. In his attempts, Cornbluth ends up offending the same couple twice and is beaten up.As the days tick away before Madison leaves, Allen attempts to ask her to marry him. However, she refuses Allen's offer, and he grows irritated at her, regarding how secretive she has been about where she comes from. Madison then runs away, and Allen attempts to find her, before returning to the produce center. Shortly after arriving, Madison returns, and this time decides to accept Allen's proposal.Allen is eager to get married now, but decides to do so after the event with the President, planning to drive to Maryland to wed.

Allen and Madison are kept in isolation, but Madison is soon put into Allen's tank. She attempts to apologize for not revealing her secret, but Allen silently refuses to listen to her.After it appears he is not of Madison's species, Allen is released, only to be mobbed by press outside his apartment. Freddie manages to get Allen out of there, and they return to the office at the family business. Allen is still upset that in his search for love, the one girl he fell madly in love with has turned out to be a fish. Freddie chastises Allen for his attitude, claiming that in the last few days, his brother has been happier than he's been in years and certainly happier than (Freddie) has ever been with a woman.Cornbluth meanwhile, has been allowed to view Madison, but has not been allowed to voice opinions regarding her care and well-being. The scientist in charge of project, Dr Ross, explains his plan to see how Madison reacts to other marine life before his people dissect her. Cornbluth voices his dissension, but Ross just chides him along.Now feeling miserable for what he has done, Cornbluth is surprised when he is found by Allen at the dentist. Allen has decided that he loves and wants to save Madison, and needs Cornbluth's help.Along with Freddie, the three of them infiltrate the lab, and make off with Madison, leaving Freddie behind to distract them for a bit. Cornbluth and the two brothers impersonate Swedish biologists and are able to bluff their way past the half-Swedish guard when Freddie speaks his language having learned it from watching watching Swedish pornography.Madison's escape is soon found out, and the military begins a chase through the Manhattan streets. Cornbluth at one point jumps out in an attempt to buy some time, but ends up almost being run over.Finally, off a pier on the Hudson River, Madison and Allen say their farewells, with Madison explaining to Allen that he can come with her, but if he does, he cannot come back to land. It is also here that she finally reveals that she was the little girl he saw in the waters off Cape Cod, and Allen is overjoyed to know that it was all real.As the military at first closes in, Allen has Madison swim off, but as he watches her leave, he dives in after her, though he is unable to swim. Just as when he was a boy, Madison rescues Allen, but soon, the two have to contend with divers trying to stop the two of them.After a small skirmish, Madison grabs Allen's hand, and they swim away. Thanks to a kiss by her, Allen is now able to breathe underwater, and after some time swimming, they make their way to a distant underwater kingdom."
Amadeus,1984,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086879/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The life, success and troubles ofWolfgang Amadeus Mozart, as told byAntonio Salieri, the contemporaneous composer who was deeply jealous of Mozart's talent and claimed to have murdered him. Antonio Salieribelieves thatWolfgang Amadeus Mozart's music is divine and miraculous. He wishes he was himself as good a musician as Mozart so that he can praise the Lord through composing. He began his career as a devout man who believes his success and talent as a composer are God's rewards for his piety. He's also content as the respected, financially well-off, court composer of Austrian Emperor Joseph II. But he's shocked to learn that Mozart is such a vulgar creature, and can't understand why God favored Mozart to be his instrument. Salieri's envy has made him an enemy of God whose greatness was evident in Mozart. He is ready to take revenge against God and Mozart for his own musical mediocrity.—Khaled Salem Claiming to have murdered the composerWolfgang Amadeus Mozart, the elderlyAntonio Salierirecounts to a priest his dealings with the brilliant composer. Salieri was court composer to Austrian Emperor Joseph II when Mozart and he first met. The Emperor, a major patron of the arts, immediately commissioned Mozart to write an opera in German, rather than the customary Italian. Mozart is childish, arrogant, annoying and brilliant all at once and Salieri is simultaneously in awe and green with envy at his genius. Salieri uses Mozart's difficult relationship with his father and his guilt over being a bad son to drive him slightly mad and into a downward spiral of ill health, leading to his death.—garykmcd It is the early 19th century. An old man is thrown into an insane asylum after trying to commit suicide. He isAntonio Salieriand in the asylum he is visited by a priest, to whom he confesses that he killed Mozart. He then recounts his time as court composer to Emperor Joseph II of Austria. Mozart appears at the court and is hired by the Emperor to produce an opera. His genius is quite evident. Salieri is a devout Christian man and believes all musical talent and inspiration is given by God. Mozart's personal life and extracurricular activities appall Salieri. He cannot reconcile Mozart's talent and his lifestyle and sets out to drive him from the court. Initially his aim is to undermine him but over time his intentions turn deadlier.—grantss Wolfgang Amadeus Mozartis a remarkably talented young Viennese composer who unwittingly finds a fierce rival in the disciplined and determinedAntonio Salieri. Resenting Mozart for both his hedonistic lifestyle and his undeniable talent, the highly religious Salieri is gradually consumed by his jealousy and becomes obsessed with Mozart's downfall, leading to a devious scheme that has dire consequences for both men.—Jwelch5742 The story begins in 1823 as the elderly Antonio Salieri attempts suicide by slitting his throat while loudly begging forgiveness for having killed Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart in 1791. Placed in a lunatic asylum for the action, Salieri is visited by a young priest who seeks to take his confession. Salieri is sullen and uninterested but eventually warms to the priest and launches into a long ""confession"" about his relationship with Mozart.Salieri's story goes on through the night and into the next day. He reminisces about his youth, particularly about his devotion to God and his love for music and how he pledges to God to remain celibate as a sacrifice if he can somehow devote his life to music. He describes how his father's plans for him were to go into commerce, but suggests that the sudden death of his father, who choked to death during a meal, was ""a miracle"" that allowed him to pursue a career in music. In his narrative, he is suddenly an adult joining the 18th century cultural elite in Vienna, the ""city of musicians"". Salieri begins his career as a devout, God-fearing man who believes his success and talent as a composer are God's rewards for his piety. He is content as the court composer for Holy Roman Emperor Joseph II.Mozart arrives in Vienna with his patron, Count Hieronymus von Colloredo, the Prince-Archbishop of Salzburg. Salieri secretly observes Mozart at the Archbishop's palace, but they are not properly introduced. Salieri sees that offstage, Mozart is irreverent and lewd. He also first recognizes the immense talent displayed in the adult works of Mozart. In 1781, when Mozart meets the Emperor, Salieri presents Mozart with a ""March of Welcome"", which he toiled to create. After hearing the march only once, Mozart plays it from memory, critiques it, and effortlessly improvises a variation, transforming Salieri's ""trifle"" into the ""Non più andrai"" march from his 1786 opera ""The Marriage of Figaro"".Salieri reels at the notion of God speaking through the childish, snappish Mozart: nevertheless, he regards his music as miraculous. Gradually, Salieri's faith is shaken. He believes that God, through Mozart's genius, is cruelly laughing at Salieri's own musical mediocrity. Salieri's struggles with God are intercut with scenes showing Mozart's own trials and tribulations with life in Vienna: pride at the initial reception of his music; anger and disbelief over his subsequent treatment by the Italians of the Emperor's court; happiness with his wife Constanze and his son Karl; and grief at the death of his father Leopold. Mozart becomes more desperate as the family's expenses increase and his commissions decrease. When Salieri learns of Mozart's financial straits, he sees his chance to avenge himself, using ""God's Beloved"" (the literal meaning of ""Amadeus"") as the instrument.Salieri hatches a complex plot to gain ultimate victory over Mozart and God. He disguises himself in a black mask and costume similar to one he saw Leopold wear at a party, and commissions Mozart to write a requiem mass, giving him a down payment and the promise of an enormous sum upon completion. Mozart begins to write the piece, the Requiem Mass in D minor, unaware of the true identity of his mysterious patron and oblivious of his murderous intentions. Glossing over any details of how he might commit the murder, Salieri dwells on the anticipation of the admiration of his peers and the court, when they applaud the magnificent Requiem, and he claims to be the music's composer. Only Salieri and God would know the truth that Mozart wrote his own requiem mass, and that God could only watch while Salieri finally receives the fame and renown he deserves.Mozart's financial situation worsens and the composing demands of the Requiem and ""The Magic Flute"" drive him to the point of exhaustion as he alternates work between the two pieces. Constanze leaves him and takes their son with her. His health worsens and he collapses during the premiere performance of ""The Magic Flute"". Salieri takes the stricken Mozart home and convinces him to work on the Requiem. Mozart dictates while Salieri transcribes through the night. When Constanze returns in the morning, she orders Salieri to leave. Constanze locks the manuscript away despite Salieri's objections, but as she goes to wake her husband, Mozart has died. The Requiem is left unfinished, and Salieri is left powerless as Mozart's body is hauled out of Vienna for burial in a pauper's mass grave during a rainstorm.The film ends as Salieri finishes recounting his story to the visibly shaken young priest. Salieri concludes that God killed Mozart rather than allow Salieri to share in even an ounce of his glory, and that he is consigned to be the ""patron saint of mediocrity"". Salieri mockingly absolves the priest of his own mediocrity and blesses his fellow patients as he is taken away in his wheelchair. The last sound heard before the closing credits roll is Mozart's high-pitched laughter."

Block is surprised when he sees that the girl is Jacklin.When she is done work they go back to her apartment where he interviews Jacklin about Cory. She tells him that she knows Cory had a client that liked to use handcuffs on her. She thinks he was a cop and coos, ""Maybe it was you?"" Later we see Block and Jacklin laying together on the bed after making love. As the camera pans up their naked bodies we see that Jacklin is attached to the head of the bed with Block's handcuffs. Later as they leave the apartment Jacklin tosses away one of her ever present popsicle sticks. We see it picked up by the man wearing sneakers.The next day Amanda is making breakfast. Before her father comes into the room, her curiosity temps her to open an envelope he was carrying. Inside she finds explicit photos of the murdered women. She stuffs the pictures back inside before he can see what she has done. During breakfast she asks her father why he stays out late every night. He replies he is working on solving the murders and that there are some people he can only talk to at night, because they work at night.Block has a change of heart and visits Thibodeaux at the Rape Prevention Center. He gives her some details about the suspect so she can disseminate it to potential victims.When Block gets home that night he can see that Amanda and Penny are upset. Their mother has called to tell them she is getting remarried. Later Block leaves them in the care of a babysitter, Mrs. Holstein (Margie O'Dair) and decides to checkout a seedy bathhouse were people go for anonymous relations. He shows Cory's picture to one woman there, Judy Harper (Margaret Howell). She does not recognize the victim, but invites Block into the room and they have make love. Block does not realize it, but the killer has been trailing him and sees the two of them together.Late that night Amanda leaves her room and finds her father is back home on the sofa. He has drunk himself to sleep holding a wedding picture of himself and his ex-wife. Amanda climbs up on top of Block, tenderly puts her arms around him and falls asleep.The next morning a woman's strangled body is found in the river. When Block arrives at the scene he is shocked to find it is Harper.Block goes by Thibodeaux's gym and sees her there. They talk about the case and he then asks her out to lunch. It is clear a relationship is starting to develop.A fetish doll with an attached riddle arrives at police headquarters. Block thinks it is from the killer. The message also had an invitation for him to visit ""Sams."" Sams is an club where the killer has arranged for Block to have a S&M session with a girl (Rebecca Clemons). She hands him a whip. He asks what it is for and she replies, ""To use on me."" Block declines the invitation and she gives him a black rose telling him that she does not know the name of the man who paid her, but her instructions were to send Block on to a local gay bar.At the bar Block meets a gay prostitute (Robert Harvey) wearing a similar black rose. Block declines his services and sends him across the street to a warehouse where he was supposed to meet the man who was paying him. Block follows hoping to catch the killer, but when he arrives he finds the prostitute strangled and hanging from one of the mardi gras floats housed there.Back at headquarters Block solves the riddle and discovers one of Jacklin's broken popsicle sticks inside the doll. Meanwhile she has been kidnapped and her roommate discovers her missing. Soon after Jacklin is found strangled, lying in a fountain. Nearby the tie Block left behind is found around one of the fountain's statues.Disturbed, Block calls Thibodeaux. Together they take Block's daughters out in costume to a street celebration. As the girls watch some street performers, Block talks with Thibodeaux about the case and his misgivings about the direction of his life. Penny buys a balloon from a clown/balloon vender and the camera pans down to show us he is wearing the killer's sneakers. The balloon he gives her is tied with the same type of red ribbon he used to strangle the women, perhaps as a threat to Block, but Penny accidently let's the balloon go and it drifts off before the detective can see it.That night after the girls go to bed, Thibodeaux asks if Block likes to use handcuffs on his dates because is scared of strong women. He admits this may be true. Thibodeaux offers to let him use them on her, but he decides not to and they go to bed. That night he has a dream of Thibodeaux being attacked by a man wearing a ski mask. When the mask is pulled off, Block's face is underneath. He wakes up in a cold sweat.The next day the lab finds the same barley and glass traces found in Silber's apartment on some of the money paid to Cory. Since the serial numbers can be traced to cash sent to the payroll office of ""Dixie Brewery"" it seems likely that the killer works there. Block and Molinari pay the president of the Brewery (Don Lutenbacher) a visit. He informs them that there are over 1,000 men working at the Brewery. Block suggests the try to eliminate some of the possibilities based on schedule and blood type.While Block did not see the killer at the Brewery, the killer saw him. That night when Block gets home from work he finds the house in disarray and the babysitter missing. Rushing to the girls' room he finds Penny there, but Amanda gone. He instructs Penny to hide in the closet until he comes back. When she opens the door one of the household dogs who was sleeping in there jumps out.Block finds Amanda lying deadly still on his own bed. Fearing the worst he turns her over. She is alive, but has been handcuffed and gagged. Not even taking the time to remove the cuffs, he carries her back to the girls' closet to hide with Penny, then starts searching the house. He finds all the household dogs (except the one Penny let loose) killed. Mrs. Holstein has also been murdered and stuffed in the dryer. The killer sneaks up on Block and tires to strangle him, but Block is saved when the last dog alive attacks the killer, distracting him.In the closet the girls quake with fear as they hear two gunshots. A minute later the door opens and they see a figure with a red ribbon dangling from one hand, as if prepared to strangle them. When the figure bends down, however, they see that it is their father and they jump into his arms.The police arrive, but the killer has escaped. Amanda only has minor injuries, but is taken to the hospital for observation.The next day Block notices a clipping from a former case: a cop who raped two teenagers. Acting on a hunch he asks Molinari to check to see if the perpetrator, Leander Rolfe (Marco St. John) might work at Dixie. Not only does Rolfe work at Dixie, but he got out of prison just before the first murder occurred. He also has a beef with Block since Block originally arrested him more than a decade ago. That night Block and Molinari stake out Rolfe's apartment.Penny is safe as she is staying overnight with Amanda at the hospital, but Block arranges for protection for Thibodeaux: two policemen outside her house and one in the living room. When Block can't get them on the radio, however, he races over to her house. The cops are dead and he arrives just in time to prevent Thibodeaux from being strangled by the killer, Rolfe.Block chases Rolfe through a cemetery while the rest of the police force try to catch up with them. The chase then moves to a railroad yard where Block and Rolfe play cat and mouse among the moving trains. They finally wind up wrestling lying across a track as a freight train approaches. Block rolls off the track at the last second and finds his throat still gripped by Rolfe's hand, which has been severed at the arm from the rest of his body by the train's wheels.The rest of the force arrives and starts to look for Rolfe's body which was apparently dragged away by the train. Meanwhile Block starts walking up the tracks to where a police car pulls up and Thibodeaux jumps out. They embrace and the picture ends."
The Natural,1984,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087781/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A middle-aged unknown comes seemingly out of nowhere to become a legendary baseball player with almost supernatural talent. An unknown middle-aged batter named Roy Hobbs with a mysterious past appears out of nowhere to take a losing 1930s baseball team to the top of the league in this magical sports fantasy. With the aid of a bat cut from a lightning struck tree, Hobbs lives the fame he should have had earlier when, as a rising pitcher, he is inexplicably shot by a young woman.—Keith Loh <loh@sfu.ca> The movie opens with the story of a young boy, Roy Hobbs (Paul Sullivan Jr. & Mark Atienza), who is a farm boy with an incredible talent for playing baseball. Encouraged by his father (Alan Fudge), Hobbs is told by him that he has an amazing gift for throwing a baseball, but he needs more than that if he is to succeed and play in the big leagues. Hobbs witnesses his father's death while working under a large tree in the front of his home. Some years later, a lightning bolt strikes the tree splitting it into pieces. Hobbs takes a part of the tree and carves out a bat, using a tool to burn into the bat the name Wonderboy along with a symbol of a lightning bolt for whence it came.A few years later, Hobbs finds out he is going to get a chance to play in the big leagues. In the middle of the night, he runs to meet his longtime girlfriend, Iris Gaines (Rachel Hall as young Iris), to inform her that he is going to try out for the Chicago Cubs. He tells Iris that he loves her, and as soon as he makes the team he will return for her. They happily make love in her barn before he leaves. The next scene shows Hobbs on a train with the Cubs' scout, Sam Simpson (John Finnegan), where he meets a sports journalist, Max Mercy (Robert Duvall), who is on the train covering a famous baseball hitter known as the Whammer (Joe Don Baker).The train stops at a carnival where Hobbs and the Whammer each have an opportunity to show off their skills at various games. The Whammer has caught the interest of a young lady by the name of Harriet Bird (Barbara Hershery), who is also on the way to Chicago. After watching Hobbs miss a stack of empty jugs with a baseball, Max claims that Sam has missed again in finding talent. Sam bets Max $10 that Hobbs can strike out the Whammer on only three pitches. After watching the first pitch for a strike, the Whammer swings and misses the next two pitches and strikes out. Back on the train, Ms. Bird garners an interest in Hobbs, for whom he immediately develops a crush on her. When they reach Chicago, Harriet invites Hobbs to her hotel room. Wearing all black and a veil, Harriet asks Hobbs to confirm what he told her on the train, that he would eventually be the best in the game. When Hobbs agrees, Harriet raises a gun and shoots him.Fifteen years later, Pop Fisher (Wilford Brimley), the manager of the New York Knights, discovers he has a new ""rookie"" for his team, a thirty-four-year-old man named Roy Hobbs (Robert Redford), whom the team's owner, the stingy Judge Banner (Robert Prosky), has signed for a paltry $500. Hobbs also meets Max Mercy, the sports journalist, again, but Max does not recognize him. The Knights are doing very poorly; even their playing field is dried up from a long drought. Pop is skeptical of Hobbs. When Hobbs refuses to join the hypnotist sessions to which Pop subjects the team, Pop benches Hobbs for three weeks. One afternoon during batting practice, Hobbs hits home run after home run with ease. This catches the attention of Pop Fisher, who questions the homemade bat that Hobbs is using. Skeptical to the end, Pop says he'll permit Hobbs to use the bat if it measures within specifications.Hobbs continues to sit on the bench as the Knights continue to lose. During a game against the Phillies,
Bartholomew 'Bump' Bailey (Michael Madsen) is benched by Pop for not hustling enough. Pop decides to send Hobbs into the game to pinch-hit for Bailey. After Pop wishes him luck and to smash the cover off the ball, Hobbs does exactly that in his first at-bat, causing the Phillies manager to protest to the umpires requesting the real ball and not the mess of string that resulted from Hobbs amazing hit. Hobbs continues to wow everyone with his amazing talent. The Commissioner validates that Hobbs' bat was within specifications and can be used in a game. After Pop threatens to pull Bailey from the lineup, Bailey tries so hard in the next game to outdo Hobbs that he accidentally cracks his skull against the wall, which results in his untimely death.The Knights begin to rise in the standings due to Hobbs' amazing performance. The lightning bolt on Hobbs bat inspires teammate John Olsen (Jon Van Ness) to wear a patch on his arm, which results in a stellar batting practice session by Olsen. Soon after, the entire team adopts the lightning bolt patch, which is worn on their right sleeves. The teams stellar hitting continues as does the Knights win streak. While getting a shoeshine one afternoon, bench coach Red Blow (Richard Farnsworth) tells Hobbs about the deal that the Judge made with Pop in an effort to swindle the remaining shares from him. If Pop wins the pennant, the Judge would give away his shares. If Pop loses, then the Judge gets all of Pops shares and he's out for good.During practice one afternoon, Hobbs is asked by a teammate to throw him a pitch to hit. With the ever-inquisitive Max looking on in the stands, Hobbs rears back and throws a pitch so hard that it sticks into the protective mesh behind home plate. Upon panning back to the stands, Max has disappeared from his seat.
After practice, Pop informs Hobbs that the Judge wants to see him. During the visit, the Judge attempts to persuade Hobbs to help him get control of the team from Pop. Hobbs stubbornly refuses and leaves the office. Upon his departure, the Judge's personal bookie, Gus Sands (Darren McGavin), assures that Hobbs isn't as greedy as Bump Bailey was but he could be persuaded in different ways.Max takes Hobbs to dinner the next evening. While there, he meets Gus and his female companion, Memo Paris (Kim Basinger). During the dinner visit, Gus bets Hobbs $100 that he knows exactly how much money he has in his pocket, give or take one dollar. Gus guesses $10 and Hobbs pulls eight greenbacks out of his wallet. Gus tells Hobbs not to forget the silver, which totals $1.37, leading Gus to win the bet. When Hobbs informs Gus that he will soon pay him the $100, Gus politely dismisses the bet stating that perhaps Hobbs can do him a favor in return someday. Hobbs states that he shouldnt bet on it and pulls two more silver coins out of Memo's ear.Hobbs begins a relationship with Memo, but Pop is concerned that it's bad luck for Hobbs. Pop's feelings are confirmed as Hobbs quickly falls into a hitting slump. Hobbs obsession with Memo continues as does the Knights losing streak. Hobb's longtime girlfriend, Iris (Glenn Close), has been paying close attention to Hobbs in the papers and sees that the Knights are going to be playing in Chicago. Iris decides to attend the game to watch Hobbs play. During an at-bat in Chicago, Iris notices Hobbs is struggling and stands up hoping to get his attention. Hobbs notices a woman standing up in the crowd for him, but appears unsure who it is. Without purpose or reason, Hobbs crushes the next pitch into the centerfield scoreboard clock for a home run, and the Knights losing streak comes to an end.After the game, Hobbs receives a note from Iris stating it was her in the stands and requesting to meet with him. Hobbs meets Iris at the café where they have a nice visit. Iris is cordial during the visit, but remains distant to Hobbs. Upon leaving, Hobbs asks Iris to come to the next game, but she says she can't for other reasons. After another great game performance, Hobbs leaves the ballpark only to find Iris waiting for him outside. The two walk to Iris home from the ballpark. During the walk, Hobbs elaborates to Iris about his troubled past and how he failed to return for Iris after leaving for Chicago. At Iris' house, Hobbs notices a baseball glove lying on the couch. Iris informs him it belongs to her son. Hobbs is shocked to hear this and asks where the father is. Iris says that his father lives in New York. After a warm embrace, Iris informs Hobbs he needs to leave.Hobbs regains his focus as do the rest of the Knights, and the team begins a winning streak that results in the Knights' three games ahead of the Pirates in the standings for the pennant with just three games to go. Hobbs attempts to contact Iris by phone, but is unsuccessful. Soon after, the Knights hold a banquet for the team. During the event, Gus informs Hobbs that he has already bet against the Knights, which raises suspicions with Hobbs, who again rejects any of Gus persuasions. Gus informs Memo of his disappointment, who subsequently poisons the unsuspecting Hobbs with a tainted piece of food. This results in Hobbs being taken to a local hospital where he is laid up sick for three days. During his visit, the doctor (Peter Poth) informs Hobbs that his stomach lining has been gradually deteriorating. Upon pumping his stomach, the doctors remove an old bullet that has apparently been there for many years, apparently the bullet that Harriet Bird had shot him with.Meanwhile, the Knights lose their next three games, allowing the Pirates to catch and tie them for first place. Memo visits Hobbs at the hospital. Memo begs Hobbs not to play as it may kill him, but Hobbs insists that Pop Fisher and the Knights need him in order to win. Hobbs sneaks out of the hospital to test whether he can play or not. Upon seeing Max in the stands taking pictures, Hobbs hits a number of balls into the stands toward Max to scare him away, telling Max to never look back at the past. Successful in shooing off Max, Hobbs crumples to the ground and is rushed back to the hospital. That evening, Judge Banner visits Hobbs and offers him $20,000 to throw the next game, which will decide who wins the pennant. The Judge leaves Hobbs with the money assuming that they have a deal.The team arrives the next day to visit Hobbs in the hospital. Hobbs wishes the team luck as he will not be ready to play in the game. Iris comes to visit Hobbs at the hospital, but before she can see Hobbs she is confronted by Max who shows her some old photos from Hobbs past attempting to blackmail her for information. She flatly rejects Max and continues on to meet with Hobbs, who begrudgingly admits to his failure of falling for Harriet Bird on the train all those years ago, and how all of that resulted in his life not turning out how he expected. Hobbs asks Iris if she and her son are going to the game the next day. After confirming this, she is unable to finish before being interrupted by the nurse (Elizabeth Ann Klein) treating Hobbs. She quietly dismisses herself.Hobbs returns to the ballpark the next day. In the presence of Gus and Memo, Hobbs gives the Judge back his envelope of money informing them all that its his plan to play in the game that evening. The Judge attempts to blackmail Hobbs one last time, but is unsuccessful. Memo pulls out a revolver and fires a round to scare Hobbs, but relinquishes the weapon to Hobbs before breaking down in tears, jealous and envious of Hobbs in being such a good man.Hobbs returns to the clubhouse where he meets Pop and Red in the shower cleaning up before the game. Pop tells Hobbs that he's the greatest player that he's ever seen, and tells Hobbs to suit up for the game. Max meets Hobbs in the clubhouse prior to the game, claiming that he's there to protect the game and that he'll do what's necessary to ensure that. The next shot is of the Knights taking the field; Iris and her son in the stands clapping as Hobbs trots out to right field to start the game. Hobbs is able to perform, but not without being in visible discomfort. He strikes out in his first at-bat.Al Fowler (Ken Grassano), the Knights pitcher, walks a batter then allows a home run on the next pitch. Hobbs suspects that the Judge has bought off Fowler and pleas with Fowler to give the Pirates the real stuff. He agrees to play for real when Hobbs starts hitting the ball again. Hobbs strikes out in his second at-bat. Iris persuades a stadium usher to deliver a note to Hobbs in the dugout. Upon reading the note, Hobbs is visibly moved by what Iris has told him Hobbs is the father of Iris son! Down 2-0, the Knights begin a rally in the bottom of the 9th inning. With runners on first and third base, Hobbs steps up to the plate for his third at-bat. After two errant pitches, the Pittsburgh manager puts in his young phenom left-handed relief pitcher to face Hobbs. The next pitch is fouled off into the press box where it breaks the glass in front of Max who is reporting on the game. After a swing and a miss, Hobbs takes the next pitch down the right field line but it veers off foul. Upon running back to the batters box, Hobbs is shocked to see that Wonderboy has split in two. He tasks the batboy, Bobby Savoy, to pick him out a replacement bat. Bobby returns with another homemade bat that Hobbs helped him make, named Savoy Special. Noticing blood on his jersey, the Pirates catcher calls for an inside fastball. Hobbs drives the pitch high up into the right field lights, which result in a magnificent explosion causing other lights in the stadium to explode in a shower of sparks.Hobbs rounds the bases in an almost dreamlike sequence as the Knights win the game and Pop Fisher looks on. As the team jumps on Hobbs as he crosses home plate, the camera pans to the ball that is still flying out into night. As the ball drops in the next sequence, it lands in the glove of Iris' son, who throws the ball back to his father, Roy Hobbs, while Iris looks on in the distance."
"Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan, Lord of the Apes",1984,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087365/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A missing heir of respected Scottish family, raised in African jungles by animals, finally returns to his estate only to realize that difference between the two worlds is really significant. A shipping disaster in the nineteenth century has stranded a man and woman in the wilds of Africa. The lady is pregnant, and gives birth to a son in their tree house. The mother dies soon afterwards. An ape enters the house and kills the father, and a female ape takes the tiny boy as a replacement for her own dead infant, and raises him as her son. Twenty years later, Captaine Phillippe D'Arnot discovers the man who thinks he is an ape. Evidence in the tree house leads him to believe that he is the direct descendant of the Earl of Greystoke, and thus takes it upon himself to return the man to civilization.—Murray Chapman <muzzle@cs.uq.oz.au> The 1880s. Shipwrecked and marooned on the West African coast, little John Clayton, the seventh Earl of Greystoke, becomes the newest member of a simian community when Kala, a compassionate ape, becomes the boy's adoptive mother. Almost two decades later, the Belgian explorer, Captain Phillippe D'Arnot, member of a zoological expedition funded by the British Museum, crosses paths with a now-grown-up John, the smart lord of the apes, and before long, a profound bond develops between the two men. However, John's place is with his grandfather in the family's country estate in the Lowlands of Scotland. Can ape-like John come to terms with his human side and embrace his destiny as the Earl of Greystoke?—Nick Riganas Scotland, 1885. The young John Clayton of the house of Greystoke (Paul Geoffrey) plans a voyage to Africa, to one of the colonies near the coast, along with his pregnant wife, Alice (Cheryl Campbell). John bids farewell to his father, the Sixth Earl of Greystoke (Ralph Richardson).Months later, off the coast of Equatorial West Africa, we see the remnants of a shipwreck, the very one chartered by Clayton. He and his wife have survived the wreck, but are now marooned in the jungle. They set up a house in the trees using timber and decking from the ship. Alice soon gives birth to their baby, a son named Jonathan Jr., but develops a severe fever soon after. During her sickness, Clayton writes in his journal of the difficulties in caring for his ill wife and their baby. Alice's breast milk becomes virulent and she deteriorates further. One day, Clayton checks on his wife to find her dead. As he weeps over her body, a large primate called White Eyes, leader of a nearby clan of apes, enters the home. Petrified, Clayton lunges for his gun but is quickly overtaken by the ape and killed when the ape charges him and beats him to death. Several other apes from the clan enter the house and begin to curiously inspect the house. A female named Kala, mate of the ape Silverbeard, enters the home carrying the body of her recently deceased baby. When she discovers John Jr. crying in his crib, she drops her baby's lifeless body and claims John as her own. She flees the house with the rest of the apes as one of them accidentally discharges Clayton's revolver while examining it.John (at age fiveDanny Potts) grows, brought up as an ape with the assumed name of Tarzan, but falls under constant persecution from White Eyes, who considers him an outsider because of his hairless skin. Despite trying hard to fit in, Tarzan's human attributes prove beneficial to him. Sipping water from a stream with a peer, Droopy Ears, Tarzan is forced into the water when the two are attacked by a leopard. Tarzan's friend is killed but he finds that he has the ability to swim to safety, whereas the apes would have normally stayed out of the water.Later (at age 12Eric Langlois), Tarzan eventually discovers the home his human mother and father built. He finds his mother's locket which contains pictures of the Claytons, though Tarzan does not recognize them. He also finds his father's dagger and finds that it can be used as a weapon. He fashions a belt for himself and carries the dagger with him. While foraging for food, Kala is attacked and shot with arrows by a native hunting tribe. Tarzan rushes to her rescue and tries to fight off the attackers. One of the hunters, wielding a spear, lunges at Tarzan who dodges the point as it hits his already dying mother. The blow finishes Kala and Tarzan, in a rage, breaks the man's back over his shoulder. As he crouches over Kala's body, Tarzan begins to moan and scream, a mournful sound heard by the rest of the hunters.Many years later another hunting party, this time English, enters the jungle near Tarzan's home. The party is led by the vicious Major Jack Downing (Nigel Davenport), a game hunter who's been charged with bringing primates back to Britain, alive or dead, to be studied or stuffed for museum displays. Among the party are Capitaine Phillippe d'Arnot (Ian Holm) and Sir Evelyn Bount (John Wells), both contemptuous of Downing's sadism. They find the Clayton home and set up camp but are later attacked by a native tribe. Downing is killed immediately along with most of the guides. D'Arnot is wounded when an arrow pierces his lower abdomen. He manages to escape the fray but is followed by a few natives. He loses them as he hides in a large tree and, shortly after pulling the arrow from his body, is found by an adult Tarzan (Christopher Lambert) and a few apes.Tarzan brings d'Arnot to the ape camp and tends to his wounds, much to White Eyes' disapproval. Tarzan also fends off the curiosity of his fellow apes while d'Arnot recovers. During this time he discovers that Tarzan is a talented mimic who can imitate most of the animals in the jungle along with d'Arnot's mumblings. One day, Tarzan begins to hum the same tune d'Arnot does. When d'Arnot finds that Tarzan has the ability to speak, he is delighted and teaches Tarzan rudimentary English. Tarzan shows d'Arnot the locket and takes him to the Clayton home where he found it. There, d'Arnot discovers Tarzan's ancestry from John Sr.'s journal and resolves to bring Tarzan (whom d'Arnot now calls ""Jean""; the French pronunciation of ""John"") home to his family in England.However, Tarzan's first priority is to gain leadership of the ape tribe. Having been beaten and tormented by White Eyes his entire life, Tarzan challenges the older ape to a showdown. The two engage in a vicious fight that continues through the jungle while d'Arnot and the other apes look on. Tarzan and White Eyes fall into a large pool and disappear under water. White Eyes appears at the surface revealing a large stab wound in his body. Tarzan emerges from the water victorious and is respectfully greeted by the other apes as their leader.D'Arnot continues to educate Tarzan, though he is met with resistance at first. Tarzan finds it difficult to easily discard his ape upbringing. Eventually, d'Arnot decides that John is civilized enough to return to the world & takes him out to a small settlement on the edge of the jungle where they make their way, by boat, back to England.Upon their return, John is brought to the home of his grandfather, the Sixth Earl of Greystoke, who is deteriorating a bit from age and exhibits some eccentric behavior, presumably from the loss of his son and daughter-in-law. Lord Greystoke welcomes his grandson, though sometimes forgetting that he is not his son returned. John meets Lord Greystoke's young ward, Jane Porter (Andie MacDowell), who is visiting from America and is engaged to another man. Finding it difficult to be seen as anything but a novelty in a social sense, and with his behavior seen as threatening and savage, John falls into a depression. His mood is lifted slightly when he befriends a mentally disabled worker on the Greystoke estate and, while in his company, is able to relax and act naturally.Jane takes it upon herself to teach John more English, French, and social skills such as table manners and dancing. The two become very close and develop feelings for one another, making love one evening in secret. Eventually, Jane leaves her fiance with the intent to marry John.During a large ball honoring John's return to the family, Lord Greystoke sneaks away from the crowd, appearing to enjoy a renewed vigor at the return of his grandson. Reminiscing of a childhood game he used to play, he uses a silver tray as a toboggan and slides down the grand staircase, only to crash into the railing at the bottom. John discovers him and holds his grandfather as he dies in his arms, apparently of a head injury. John reacts similarly as he did to Kala's death, devastated and confused by the loss and frustrated with his displacement in society.John is later on hand to cut the ribbon for a new wing at the Natural History Museum -- his grandfather was the chief benefactor. Bothered by the exhibits of preserved animals, John sneaks away into an alley and comes across an institute for the study of primates next to the museum. When he enters the lab he discovers, to his horror, several small monkeys and a gorilla that have been dissected. Several other primates are kept alive in cages, the largest of which contains an ape who John immediately recognizes as his adoptive father, Silverbeard. John frees him and the other primates and escapes. At the museum, Jane, d'Arnot, and Blount are informed by the police that John is running through the streets with an ape. John runs to a park where he and Silverbeard climb a tree as they are surrounded by police and a crowd. When Jane, d'Arnot, and Blount arrive, Blount gives the word to a rifleman who fatally shoots Silverbeard. John becomes enraged and sad, yelling that the ape was his father from Africa.That night, everyone discusses what is to be done with the distraught John. Jane and d'Arnot agree that he should be sent back to Africa. Because of the dual nature in his mind, he cannot adapt to life in the civilized world. Blount disagrees, stating that John is the last surviving member of the Greystoke family and that the legacy must be secured for the future. Suddenly, they hear John screaming and see him furiously driving a team of horses around the circle outside. When he comes in, covered in mud, Blount assertively tells him that he must resume his life as a Scots lord. John growls and forces Blount into a chair. He presses a muddy hand to Blount's chest and tells him, ""One half of me is Greystoke. The other half is wild!""John is taken back to Africa. At the waterfall in his former territory, he quickly meets another gorilla and runs off into the rainforest, while Jane and d'Arnot watch him leave."

The dispossessed are set-up on cots in the school gym, but the ranks of gymnasium dwellers are rapidly pruned because they are allowed to apply for fraternities, and the presumably popular ones get in and move to their new houses. Our heroes Lewis and Gilbert ask some sorority girls (The ""Pi's"", female equivalents of the Alpha Betas) what frat to join, and they are told to join Alpha Beta by Betty Childs (Julia Montgomery). Alpha Beta is told they are coming, and are coerced into having sex with a sheep, and they are sent back to the gym all the worse for wear.After a few days only the nerdiest of the nerdy are left in the gym and they go scouting the town for a place to live. The apartment hunt gives an opportunity for more gags. Eventually, Lewis locates a classic beat-up antebellum-style house with busted balcony, hanging front door and weed-filled yard. There follows a fast-forward sequence in which they make their abode a passable place and life begins to become good for the nerds.The next shot is fired by the Alpha-Betas who throw a rock through the window. The nerds (as they generally are referred to in the movie as a group) report the Alpha-Betas to the local police, who for some reason cannot do anything about this minor crime. The police recommend the ""Greek Council"". The President of the Greek Council is Stan Gable (Ted McGinley) the football captain and preppy ""beautiful person"" who is the chief villain in the film. The nerds are told they cannot file a complaint because they are not affiliated with a national fraternity, which motivates them of course to seek a national fraternity. After 29 rejection letters, they are given an audience by the one house to which they forgot to send a picture, Lambda, Lambda, Lambda (the ""Tri-Lambs""). Mr. U.N. Jefferson, president of the national TriLams (Bernie Casey) wants to turn them down, because ""you're nerds"", but Arnold Poindexter (Timothy Busfield) reads him his own bylaws which say that ANY group that applies gets a 60-day trial period. During this period the Tri-Lams work hard to be cool, culminating in a party, to which Mr. Jefferson is invited.While the Tri-Lams generally have poor luck with women, Gilbert rapidly finds a girlfriend in the computer lab. In the computer lab we are treated to some vintage orange plasma-display terminals running BASIC, on which Gilbert somehow manages to conjure up some vector-graphic sketches of himself and his (about to be) girlfriend Judy (Michelle Meyrink), thus winning her heart.As the big party approaches, only Gilbert has a date. The Pis try to torture the TriLams by promising to be their dates. They do a lovely little number with candles and matching flouncy dresses in which they serenade their potential beaus. Of course they do not show up at the party. Judy saves the day by inviting her sorority girls, the Omega Mu (the ""Moo's"" -- yes, more lowbrow humor. The girls are just chunky enough for that bit of cruelty to be understandable). The party looks grim, and we are shown a ticking clock as uncomfortable moment after moment passes.
About an hour in Booger (Curtis Armstrong) breaks out some very fat joints, and suddenly everyone relaxes. The drug humor is what one would expect. Many of the nerds and Mu's are first timers, but they take to it with enthusiasm. Mr. Jefferson and his assistant also partake of the herb, and start to appreciate their new applicants. Things are winding down after a fine party when the Pi's execute their plan. They do not show up, but they send pigs in their stead. They and the Alpha Betas then taunt the nerds from a large flat-bed truck (full of hay and pigs). Gilbert says the deed must be avenged.Stage one is a panty raid on the Pi's,
in which several are caught dressing or showering. Also, 14-year-old whiz kid Harold Wormser (Andrew Cassese) plants a number
of remote controlled cameras around the girl's dorm, and the nerds stay up all night
observing girls in various stages of undress.Stage two is shorter, the jockstraps of the Alpha-Betas are all treated with an oil which causes serious burning sensations on the parts it touches. We see the entire football team out on the field doing a little dance.The nerds continue to be persecuted, a sign is burned on their lawn. Now they are a fraternity, but they still can get no justice because Stan, the President of the Greek Council, is their enemy. Conveniently, the President of the Greek council is chosen by the winner of the previous years Greek Homecoming Festival.The festival consists of some athletic events, a charity fund-raiser, and a skit competition. The Tri-Lams win the first athletic event, a 20 lap race on tricycles which requires the drinking of 20 cans of beer (one per lap). They win because Wormser comes up with Trimethylene? another bit of science nonsense which is said to ""completely neutralize the affects of alcohol"". The driver for the nerds is Toshiro Takashi (Brian Tochi). He is the only person not to pass out before the finish line. The Tri-Lams lose some other athletic events, as you would expect, to the Alpha-Betas. Black, gay, nerd and aerobics enthusiast Lamar Latrell (Larry B. Scott) does win the Javelin toss owing to some mystery aerodynamics by Wormser.When it comes to the carnival fundraisers, the Betas and the Pis sell kisses, but the TriLams raise more money than they by selling pies. The secret ingredient turns out to be a nice picture of Betty's boobs at the bottom of every dish, presumably taken with the clandestine videocams. Betty gets hot and bothered by all the kissing and propositions her boyfriend Stan, who rebuffs her. Conveniently, the kissing was being done in costume, so Lewis takes Stan's costume and finds Betty in the Moon Room, a dark room full of air mattresses. Thinking it's Stan, she has sex with Lewis, who keeps the mask on. When Lewis unmasks himself after doing the deed, Betty is surprised by his prowess, and decides to make him his girlfriend.The final event is the skit show. The TriLams win again by doing a fairly cool punk-ish number. Another imDB member pointed out that if you listen to Billy Idols ""Flesh for Fantasy"" (1983) the beginning guitar part out of that song is the same as the music the nerds played on stage, the hand actions clapping and guitar solo is exactly the same from Idols video of the same time period.The TriLams win! Gilbert becomes next Greek Council President and ... the Alpha Beta's burn down their house. After a brief ""Oh woe is nerds"" moment, Gilbert has the stones to take on the Alpha Betas at the homecoming pep rally. He is at first beaten up, but then the national Lambda's show up -- many fit, tall, black, men, looking kind of super-fly and they command he be unhanded. He gets to take the microphone and say he is proud to be a nerd and ask other nerds to join him. Lewis, then Betty, then hundreds of alums and others join in. Emboldened, Dean Ulich orders the Alphas to rebuild the Lambda house. The Lambdas will sleep in the Alpha house, while the Alphas can sleep in the gym."
2010: The Year We Make Contact,1984,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086837/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A joint USA-Soviet expedition is sent to Jupiter to learn exactly what happened to the ""Discovery"" and its H.A.L. 9000 computer. In this sequel to 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), a joint American-Soviet expedition is sent to Jupiter to discover what went wrong with the U.S.S. Discovery against a backdrop of growing global tensions. Amongst the mysteries the expedition must explain, are the appearance of a huge black monolith in Jupiter's orbit and the fate of H.A.L.; the Discovery's A.I. computer. Based on the novel by Arthur C. Clarke.—Keith Loh <loh@sfu.ca> In 2001, the spaceship Discovery appears to have never completed its mission; to find out the source of the mysterious radio beacon which eminated from the monolith found buried on the moon. Now, in 2010, Dr. Heywood Floyd (Roy Scheider), the man held responsible for Discovery's failure, is going to Jupiter. He and his crewmates must reactivate the H.A.L. 9000 computer, so they may learn what happened, and they must find out the meaning of Dave Bowman's (Keir Dullea's) last transmission; ""my God, it's full of stars.""—Tones <tones120c@aol.com> Nine years ago, the American Discovery One's mission to Jupiter mysteriously failed. As depicted in 2001: A Space Odyssey, Discovery's HAL 9000 computer ""Hal"" (Douglas Rain)malfunctioned, killing four astronauts. The fifth, David Bowman, disappeared into a large, alien Monolith orbiting the planet. Heywood Floyd (Roy Scheider), head of the National Council on Astronautics, received the blame for the failure and left NCA.Although tension is growing between the United States and the Soviet Union, both nations prepare missions to determine what happened to Discovery. Although the Soviet Alexei Leonov will be ready before the American spaceship, the Soviets need American astronauts to help investigate Hal's malfunction and to board an American spacecraft. The US government agrees to a joint mission since Discovery's orbit is deteriorating and it will crash into Jovian moon Io before the US ship is ready. Floyd, Discovery designer Walter Curnow (John Lithgow), and HAL 9000 creator Chandra (Bob Balaban) join the Russian mission.Upon Leonov's arrival in the Jovian system, captain Tanya Kirbuk (Helen Mirren) and the other Soviets wake Floyd early from his hibernation because they have detected chlorophyll and other chemical signatures of life on the frozen moon Europa. A burst of electromagnetic radiation destroys an unmanned probe from Leonov and all telemetry records before the probe takes close-up pictures. Floyd suspects that it is a warning to keep away from Europa.After surviving a dangerous aerobraking through Jupiter's atmosphere Leonov finds Discovery abandoned but undamaged, orbiting the planet close to Io, rotating on an axis at the center of it's spine. Curnow travels with Cosmonaut Max Brailovsky, and the two, in a risky EVA, enter the spinning ship. Curnow reactivates the ship and Chandra restarts Hal, which Bowman had deactivated before Discovery arrived at Jupiter. Brailovsky (Elya Baskin) travels to the Monolith in an EVA pod, but a burst of energy that emerges from the Monolith and heads to Earth consumes him. Bowman, now an incorporeal being, appears on his widow's television and wishes her farewell. He visits his terminally ill mother in a nursing home and combs her hair before she dies.Chandra discovers the reason for Hal's malfunction: The NSC ordered the computer to conceal from Discovery's crew the fact that the mission was about the Monolith. This conflicted with Hal's basic function of open, accurate processing of information, causing him to suffer a mental breakdown.The tensions between the United States and Soviet Union escalate to what is ""technically a state of war"", and the US government orders Floyd, Curnow, and Chandra to move into Discovery. Both crews plan to leave Jupiter when a launch window opens in several weeks. Bowman appears to Floyd, warning him that they must leave Jupiter within two days because ""something wonderful"" will happen. Although Kirbuk is skeptical of Floyd's report, the Monolith suddenly disappears and a growing black spot appears on the Jovian surface. The spot is a vast grouping of Monoliths that is rapidly increasing in number, shrinking Jupiter's volume, increasing the planet's density, and modifying the chemical properties of its atmosphere.The Monolith's disappearance convinces the two crews that they must leave soon. Since neither ship can reach Earth with an early departure, they work together to use Discovery as a booster rocket for Leonov. Tension arises when Hal is not told that the Discovery will be left stranded in space, and possibly destroyed; Chandra fears that another deception may cause Hal to again malfunction. During the launch countdown Chandra tells the computer the truth. Hal agrees that it must sacrifice itself for the human beings on board Leonov to complete Discovery's mission.Leonov leaves Jupiter just before the Monoliths engulf Jupiter and increase its density to the point that nuclear fusion occurs, transforming the planet into a small star. Bowman commands Hal to repeatedly broadcast a final message to Earth:ALL THESE WORLDS
ARE YOURS EXCEPT
EUROPA
ATTEMPT NO
LANDING THERE
USE THEM TOGETHER
USE THEM IN PEACEA wave of hot plasma erupts from the forming star, incinerating Discovery.The new star's miraculous appearance inspires the American and Soviet leaders to seek peace. Europa gradually transforms from an icy wasteland to a humid jungle covered with plant life. A Monolith stands in a swamp, waiting for intelligent life forms to evolve."

Bachelor Party,1984,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086927/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A soon-to-be-married man's friends throw him the ultimate bachelor party. Rick Gassko is about to marry Debbie Thompson. Her parents hate him. Her old boyfriend hates him. They all have money and he gets a cut of the crap games on the Catholic school bus that he drives. His friends decide to give him the bachelor party of all bachelor parties in an expensive hotel with booze, adult movies and hookers. As the players catch wind of the elements of the party, each adds a little monkey wrench so that one set of hookers ends up giving demos at the bride's shower, the brides friends end up dressed as hookers in a room with a number of non English speaking Japanese businessmen, and so on, as things get out of hand.—John Vogel <jlvogel@comcast.net> Party animal Rick Gassko (Tom Hanks), who makes his living as a Catholic-school bus driver, decides to settle down and marry his girlfriend Debbie Thompson (Tawny Kitaen). After learning the news of the engagement, Rick's shocked friends, led by Jay (Adrian Zmed) (who is obsessed with breasts and is a professional photographer by profession), Gary (Gary Grossman) (ticketing agent), Rudy (Barry Diamond) (car mechanic), Ryko (Michael Dudikoff) (waiter) & brother Dr. Stanley ""Stan"" Gassko (William Tepper) (Proctologist) decide to throw him an epic bachelor party.
Stan is very unhappy with his marriage to Dr. Tina Gassko (Wendie Jo Sperber) (who is a tight ass). Stan is looking forward to bachelor party to see some naked women and blow off some steam.The bride's wealthy, conservative parents (Ed Thompson (George Grizzard) & Mrs. Thompson (Barbara Stuart)) are unhappy with her decision (since Rick is poor with no career prospects), and her father enlists the help of Debbie's ex-boyfriend Cole Whittier (Robert Prescott) to sabotage her relationship with Rick and win her back. Cole offers money to Rick to leave Debbie, but he refuses.While Debbie (who is a salesgirl in a clothing store) worries (after being told that men are pigs by her cousin Ilene (Deborah Harmon)) and goes off to a bridal shower thrown by her friends Bobbi (Tracy Smith), Rick heads to the bachelor party, which takes place in a lavish, spacious hotel suite, and promises to Debbie to remain faithful. Rick promises no hookers to Debbie.Both parties start off on the wrong foot because of Cole's meddling. Cole follows Gary, who hires hookers and after Gary leaves, he bribes the pimp to send the hookers to bridal shower party instead. The hookers enter the house and proceed to have sex in front of all the ladies. The ladies learn that the hookers were supposed to go to a bachelor party and Ilene gets the girls to go to a girls club. Michael is Rick's friend, who bartenders at the girls club and calls Rick when Debbie walks in. Tina is part of DEbbie's group and has a wild time at the club with the male strippers.
Ilene had cut off the ""dirty"" parts from a porno movie she found in Jay's car and now the guys don't have anything to get started with. Cole reaches the stag party and offers Rick his Porsche to get off Debbie. Rudy steals the car and takes it away. Cole later finds his car with a detailing job that makes it look like a pimp car.
The guys go to the girls club and play a prank, by disguising a huge penis inside a sandwich, which Debbie's mom ends up yanking, as a source of amusement for the guys. Only, Ilene sees them having their fun at the girls's expense.As the bachelor party starts to heat up (Gary goes to another pimp and gets many hookers for a cut rate price for 45 mins (as the girls have other customers in the same hotel)). when the 45 mins are up, the pimp sends his bouncer Milt to the hotel to collect his hookers.
Debbie and the girls decide to get even with Rick and his friends by dressing as hookers and deciding to catch Rick in action. But when they get to the hotel lobby, they run into Milt, who assumes that Debbie and the girls are the hookers and delivers them to a Japanese businessmen party at the same hotel. The girls manage to escape by locking all the Japanese inside the bedroom.The bachelor party becomes a wild, drunken orgy and the hotel room is trashed, which infuriates the hotel's frustrated manager (Kenneth Kimmins). Adding to the confusion is Rick's friend Brad (Bradford Bancroft), who has become despondent over the breakup of his marriage and botches several suicide attempts. When Brad tries to slit his wrists with an electric razor, Rick says, ""Well.....at least your wrists will be smooth and kissable.""
Gary falls in love with a hooker, only to realize that she is a transvestite with a penis. Jay gets Rick's ex-flame Tracey (Monique Gabrielle) to the party, who gets naked for RIck, but Rick refuses to have sex with her. Cole attacks Rick with a mechanized bow and arrow (from a hotel room across the street) and Rick spots him.
Rick and his friends capture Cole, strip him naked and hang him with bed-sheets outside his hotel room window.By now, Ricks' party had grown as many strangers have hopped in. Stan sneaks in a donkey into the party. The donkey snorts drugs and collapses. Ed arrives at the party (he was delivering a keynote speech at a conference in the same hotel) and threatens to reveal everything to DEbbie. Jay waylays Ed with all the hookers.
Debbie eventually reaches Rick's party where she is recognized despite her hooker disguise. To have fun, Rick gets her in the sack and jumps her bones and DEbbie reveals herself, concluding that she cant trust Rick.Rick convinces Debbie of his love and faithfulness (by asking the entire room if he slept if any of them that night) just as the party is raided by the police (Ed is only one left behind as everyone else escapes). In the ensuing melee, Rick and Debbie become separated and Cole kidnaps Debbie, so Rick and his friends chase after them. The chase culminates in a showdown between Rick and Cole in a 36-screen movie theater, with a fist fight taking place in synchronization with a similar fight being shown in a 3D film projected behind them; the audience believes that the real fight is an extraordinary 3D effect. Rick wins the fight and is reunited with Debbie.After the wedding, Rick and Debbie are driven to the airport for their honeymoon in Rick's school bus, which is driven by a laughing Brad."

The ""final battle"" however, will not be fought in this future world, but in the past, specifically our present... tonight.The year switches to Los Angeles, May 12, 1984 at 1:34 am. At the Griffith Park Observatory overlooking the city, lightning emanates from above a garbage truck, knocking out power. The driver sees a naked and heavily muscular man (Arnold Schwarzenegger). The man stands up and starts walking toward the city where he is spotted by three young punks. The man gives several indifferent answers to a series of sarcastic questions they punks ask him and then orders the men to give him their clothes. The punks produce knives in response. The man swats two punks aside, the third stabs him, but the man impossibly tears open the punk's body with his bare hands, and kills him. The third punk, seemingly the only one left alive, immediately begins to remove his coat.In a downtown alley, a homeless man sees a bright, circular light just above the ground, similar to the one at Griffith Park. A scarred, naked man, muscular but much smaller in size than the other man who arrived in a similar fashion, is forced through the portal and lands in the alley, in obvious pain. This is Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn). Reese takes the homeless man's pants, just as a police car pulls up and two cops yell at him to freeze. Reese is able to hide and attacks one of the cops, taking his pistol and demanding the cop tell him the date and year. The cop becomes puzzled by Reese's question. When the cop's partner arrives, Reese runs into a department store. He steals several items, including a pair of Nike sneakers and a long coat and escapes the store. In another alley outside, he steals a shotgun from an unoccupied squad car. Finding a phone book nearby, he looks up the name ""Sarah Connor.""Elsewhere a young woman, Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton), lives the life of a lonely waitress. Sharing an apartment with her friend Ginger (Bess Motta), Sarah is living out a boring life that seems to go nowhere.The muscular man steals a car and goes to a local sporting goods store where he has the owner (Dick Miller) show him several assault weapons and a pistol with laser sighting. He flatly asks for a ""phased-plasma rifle""; the owner tells him ""Only what you see, pal"". The owner tells his customer that he can take the rifles right away but the pistol has a waiting period. As he explains the process, the man casually loads the shotgun and shoots the clerk. Shortly after, the man finds a phone book and looks for the name ""Sarah Connor"" finding three listings in the Los Angeles area. He goes to the address of the first listing; as he walks to the front door, a small dog barks at him. When this Sarah Connor opens the door and acknowledges her name, the man forces his way inside and shoots her with the pistol he acquired. Not long after, at the diner where she works, Sarah's co-worker drags her to the television where she sees a news report about a woman sharing her name having been murdered by an unidentified assailant.That evening, Sarah and her roommate, Ginger, prepare for separate dates. Ginger's boyfriend, Matt (Rick Rossovich), will be coming over to spend the night. Sarah gets a message from her date, who cancels. Sarah decides to go out for pizza and sees another news report where the police announce the death of another woman sharing her name. Sarah becomes worried, and when she sees she is being followed (by Kyle Reese), she ducks into a small dance club called Tech Noir. She tries to call Ginger, however Ginger and Matt do not hear the phone as they are having sex. Not long after Sarah's call, the killer attacks and fatally shoots Ginger and Matt, before hearing Sarah's voice on their answering machine saying where she is. Sarah then phones the police department and is connected to Lieutenant Ed Traxler (Paul Winfield) and Sergeant Vukovich (Lance Henriksen), the detectives investigating the Sarah Connor killings. Traxler tells Sarah to stay put until he can get a squad car to her. The killer arrives at the club, dispatches a bouncer, and wades into the crowd.In the meantime, Reese has also entered the dance club. Sarah is finally spotted by the killer, which aims its laser-sighted pistol at her. Reese fires on the killer, hitting him with several blasts, and knocking him to the floor. Sarah sees the killer impossibly rise to its feet and open fire on Reese with the Uzi it stole. He advances on Sarah again, shooting the woman behind her, the woman's body pinning her to the floor. As the killer advances on her and prepares to shoot her, Reese appears again and hits the killer with several more shotgun blasts, blasting him out the front window of the club where he lands on the street. He tells Sarah ""Come with me if you wanna live"" as the killer arises again and chases them out the back of the club.Reese and Sarah run through an alley behind the club as the killer chases them. From the killer's perspective, we see that he is a robot of some kind who sees them through a computerized form of night vision. Reese blasts the gas tank of a nearby car which explodes. The killer is unfazed, and jumps on the hood of Reese's car, smashing its fist through the windshield and grasping at Sarah. Reese maneuvers his car in reverse and throws the killer off. Reese speeds off while the Terminator subdues a cop (screenwriterWilliam Wisher) and takes his squad car. During the chase, the killer listens closely to the police reports on the car's radio and responds in the cop's voice.During the chase, Reese frantically identifies himself as a sergeant with a serial number and explains that Sarah has ""been targeted for termination"" and that the killer chasing them is not a man but a machine called a ""terminator""; a metallic combat chassis covered with living human tissue to make it appear human. They race through several alleys, finally stopping in a parking garage. Reese tells Sarah that the first and larger 600 Series Terminators had rubber skin, but the newer 800 Series are very hard to identify which is why he followed Sarah and waited for the Terminator to make its move so he could identify it. Incredulous, Sarah panics and begins to scream for help, biting Reese on the hand. He tells her not to do it again.In the parking garage, they leave behind Reese's car and find another unlocked one. Reese explains further that a nuclear war will be initiated by a new, powerful computer system (referred to as ""Skynet"" in the first sequel) that is going to be tasked with controlling all defense systems. Reese himself has not seen the ensuing nuclear holocaust but was born and grew up destitute and starving in the ruins. He was enslaved and marked with a bar-code and was forced to work loading bodies into incinerators. The human race, he says, will be on the verge of extinction when one man, John Conner, is able to organize the remaining humans into an effective resistance movement that, by the time Reese will be sent back to the present day by Connor himself, had actually defeated Skynet. John Conner is Sarah's future son.In desperation, Skynet has sent the Terminator to the present day to murder Sarah and eliminate John Connor's existence. Reese also explains that the Terminator pursuing Sarah, is a new model, one that appears infinitely more human than its predecessors. Reese tells her the android will bleed, sweat and even has bad breath to enhance the disguise. Reese is uncertain that he can defeat the android without having the advanced weaponry of the future.The Terminator finds them there and the chase resumes. Reese has Sarah take over driving and is able to hit the Terminator with a few blasts from his shotgun. Sarah stops their car and the Terminator crashes into a wall. As the police close in, Reese is ready to shoot at them but Sarah stops him, saying they'll kill him. When she and Reese are arrested, she sees that the Terminator has escaped the scene.At Traxler's police precinct, Sarah is told that Ginger is dead and that Reese has been given to a criminal psychiatrist, Dr. Peter Silberman (Earl Boen). His story about the Terminator is treated as the babbling of extreme delusion. While watching the videotape of the interview, Silberman eagerly says that a case like Reese's could be career-making. During the interview, Silberman asks Reese why he didn't bring weaponry from the future with him, to which Reese replies that only living material will go through the time portal. Reese quickly becomes agitated and begins to scream into the camera that the Terminator must be destroyed or it will not stop until it kills Sarah.The Terminator goes back to a shoddy hotel room where it hides out. It removes one of its eyes that had been damaged when it was shot by Reese. Under the human eye is a sophisticated robotic eye that glows red. It dons a set of sunglasses, changes into different clothes and marches out to resume the hunt for Sarah, taking a pump-action SPAS shotgun and an AR-18 automatic rifle.At the police precinct, the Terminator arrives in the foyer just as Dr. Silberman is leaving and asks to see Sarah. The desk sergeant refuses to let the Terminator in. The Terminator looks menacingly at the desk sergeant, then up and around and simply states ""I'll be back."" The Terminator goes outside and one minute later crashes a car through the front door. It marches through the precinct, ruthlessly shooting every officer in its path. The Terminator gets to a circuit panel and after ripping out a main circuit cable, shoves the live wire into the fuse box creating an electrical surge that blows out all lights in the building, leaving the policemen at a disadvantage. In the battle, Traxler and Vukovich are hit by gunfire and Reese escapes confinement. He finds Sarah and the two escape the precinct.While hiding out in a sewer tunnel, Sarah realizes that Kyle's story is true. Reese tells her more about the future where humans barely survive amid the wreckage of cities and the predating of the Terminators. Initially, Skynet's vehicles, ""hunter-killers"" or HKs, would use infrared technology to find and kill humans. Kyle mentions that John Connor's talent for strategy helped the Resistance to defeat them. Later, the new Terminators, ""infiltrators"" like the one he and Sarah are on the run from, appeared and began to find hidden bunkers where humans hid out. Sarah lapses into sleep and has a nightmare of a firefight where Terminators break into a human sanctuary and massacre scores of civilians. Kyle himself is there; after finding a place to rest after a Resistance patrol, he takes out a Polaroid photo of Sarah and admires it. Alerted by dogs (who can sense a Terminator) at the entrance to the bunker, Reese joins the valiant fight to destroy a Terminator that has gotten in. The Terminator, carrying a heavy plasma gun, slaughters everyone and causes an explosion that cripples Reese. Reese sees the picture of Sarah being burned nearby.Meanwhile, the Terminator is back in its seedy motel room hideout looking at an address book that it took from Sarah and Ginger's apartment and sees a list of names including that of Sarah's mother who lives upstate. After harshly dismissing the hotel owner, the Terminator then leaves its room and gets on a stolen motorcycle and takes off on the road.Later, the two reach a roadside motel, where Kyle goes to purchase chemicals needed to make explosives. While he is shopping (using ""borrowed"" money) Sarah showers and phones her mother, telling her the phone number where she is, unaware that the Terminator is on the other line and recreating the voice of Sarah's mother. Sarah's mother is nowhere in sight, but the appearance of the cabin's knocked down front door with a large shotgun blast hole in it suggests that the Terminator forced its way in and probably shot Sarah's mother and waited for Sarah to call. The Terminator then phones the motel and, using its real voice, asks the desk clerk to give him the motel's address.At the motel, Reese returns with a bag full of unusually matched items like ammonia and corn syrup. Sarah and Kyle make a stockpile of pipe bombs filled with plastique, a compound that Kyle had learned to make and teaches Sarah to make as well, also showing her the cautious process involved to make the bombs. When Sarah asks Kyle if he has ever had a lover, he replies he has not, a fact that touches Sarah. Kyle then mentions having a photo of Sarah and how he has fallen in love with her. Realizing he has gone too far, he furiously begins loading explosives, but Sarah stops him and kisses him. The two lose their inhibitions and have sex. Their consummation results in the conception of Sarah's (and Kyle's) son, John.That evening, the Terminator tracks them to the motel and the two flee again in a stolen pickup truck (alerted by a tenant's pet dog barking at the sight of the approaching Terminator). As they race down a wide highway, Reese makes a valiant effort to destroy the Terminator with the pipe bombs he and Sarah made, however, he is hit by gunfire. Sarah manages to knock the Terminator off its motorcycle and her truck flips over.The Terminator recovers and is immediately struck by a semi-tanker truck and dragged for a short distance. After the driver stops, the Terminator kills him and takes control of the truck, (ordering the truck driver's partner to ""Get out!"") attempting to run down Sarah. Sarah is able to get Kyle out of their wrecked pickup before the Terminator runs it down.Near a factory, Kyle uses another pipe bomb to detonate the truck's tank trailer, which explodes. As Reese and Sarah embrace, the Terminator emerges from the wreckage, its flesh completely burned off. Reese and Sarah retreat into the factory, which is automated. Reese switches on as many of the machines as he can, making tracking more difficult for the Terminator. They are finally cornered and Reese places his last bomb in the endoskeleton of the Terminator, which explodes, scattering pieces of the android. Sarah, nursing a severely injured leg, finds Reese, but he's dead.She is suddenly attacked by the top half of the Terminator's skeleton. She desperately crawls away, finally luring the Terminator into a giant hydraulic press. She traps it there and, as it mindlessly tries to break her neck, pushes the button activating the press. The Terminator is crushed until its red glowing eye fades.Sarah is taken to an ambulance and sees the paramedics loading Kyle into a body bag. Later, she is driving a Jeep in the desert, a large dog in the passenger seat, seemingly towards Mexico, stopping at a gas station. She is more visibly pregnant with John Connor and has been recording her voice using a cassette player; the tapes are for her son. One of the questions she poses is whether or not she should tell John about Reese being his father and if that will affect his decision to send the warrior back in time to meet and save Sarah. While the Jeep's tank is filled, a young boy takes her picture with a Polaroid camera (it is the same picture that John will give Reese in the future). She and the boy bargain over the price and she buys it. The boy says something in Spanish and the gas station owner tells her he said that a storm is coming but she is aware of this. Sarah sees the storm approaching and she drives off into an unknown future. The ending credits roll."
Red Dawn,1984,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087985/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"It is the dawn of World War III. In the west mountains of America, a group of teenagers band together to defend their town, and their country, from invading Soviet forces. From out of the sky, Soviet, Nicaraguan, and Cuban troops begin landing on the football field of a Colorado high school. In a few seconds, the paratroopers have attacked the school and sent a group of teenagers fleeing into the mountains. Armed only with hunting rifles, pistols, and bows and arrows, the teens struggle to survive the bitter winter and the Soviet K.G.B. patrols hunting for them. Eventually, trouble arises when they kill a group of Soviet soldiers on patrol in the highlands. Soon they will wage their own guerrilla warfare against the invading Soviet troops under the banner of ""Wolverines!""—Derek O'Cain Russia launches a surprise attack on and invasion of the U.S. A small town in Colorado experiences this first hand when Russian paratroopers land in the town and quickly take it over. A small group of teenagers from the local high school, calling themselves the ""Wolverines"", manage to escape into the mountains and start to fight back.—grantss A film depicting the invasion of the United States from the south by Communist forces from Cuba, Nicaragua, and the Soviet Union in the beginning of World War III, and then the efforts of partisans from a small Colorado town to turn back the invasion.—The Net Warrior <an474980@anon.penet.fi> A group of high school students become guerrilla fighters when their town is invaded by Cuban and Soviet soldiers at the beginning of World War III in this apocalyptic fantasy. The pressures of their desperate existence begin to wear away at the ""Wolverines'"" unity as the Soviet bloc forces hunt them down.—Keith Loh <loh@sfu.ca> ""Red Dawn"" envisions an alternate history of mid-1980's America. A few title cards that precede the opening credits tell of famine in the Soviet Union, leading to food riots in Poland. The USSR subsequently invades Poland. Troubles in Central America include Cuba and Nicaragua building their armies to immense, unprecedented numbers and invading the nations of El Salvador and Honduras. A Communist revolution breaks out in Mexico. In Europe, political divisions in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) lead to the dismantling of nuclear weapons. Finally, NATO dissolves, leaving the United States with no allies or support.The story is set in a small Colorado mountain town called Calumet. Before an autumn school day in September a young man named Jed Eckert (Patrick Swayze) is dropping his younger brother Matt (Charlie Sheen) and their friend Arturo (Doug Toby) off at school. While giving a lecture on Genghis Khan's tactics in conquering Asia, their history teacher (Frank McCrae) notices paratroopers landing outside in the school football field. Thinking they may be American soldiers who are off course, he leaves the classroom to investigate and is immediately shot and killed by one of the soldiers, who then open fire on the classroom, killing at least one student. Matt and Arturo (""Aardvark"") escape the chaos when Jed pulls up, having quickly returned. They are also joined by their friends Daryl (Darren Dalton), Robert (C. Thomas Howell), and Danny (Brad Savage). They drive through town, witnessing more of the invasion. Arturo's father is seen being chased by the invaders and tries to reach them but is apprehended in the street.The group drives out of town to Robert's father's gas station on the highway. Robert's father tells them to grab supplies for camping and gives them a few rifles and ammunition. They escape to the mountains; Jed's plan is to camp out there until the conflict is over. Back in Calumet, a Cuban colonel named Bella (Ron O'Neal) oversees the hasty occupation of the town. American forces have moved in from all sides and are attacking relentlessly. Bella orders his Cuban and Nicaraguan troops to defensive positions and orders another of his men, a Russian KGB agent, to acquire documents from the gun store identifying local citizens who possess privately-owned firearms.The boys arrive in the mountains and set up camp. An argument erupts between Jed and the high school class president, Daryl (the Calumet's mayor's son), who insists they go back and turn themselves in. Jed orders him to leave, however, Daryl relents and stays with the group. The group also discovers that their radio has been destroyed when they were shot at, so their contact with the outside world is essentially cut off. While hunting deer, Robert makes a kill and drinks some of the deer's blood as part of a ritual that Jed, Matt & their father all took part in. Jed also suggests that everyone will notice a change in Robert from then on.A few weeks later in October, Jed, Matt, and Robert slip into Calumet to find out what has happened in their absence. They talk to a store owner, Alicia, who tells them that the Russians know who they are and tells them that the boys are being blamed for a series of violent crimes in the town. She also tells them that many people have been remanded to a holding camp at the town's drive-in theater. The boys go to the camp that evening and find that it's a communist re-education camp. Jed and Matt's father (Harry Dean Stanton) is a prisoner; when they see him, he has been severely beaten. Telling his sons that he was hard on them for an occurrence like this, he also implores them to avenge him.The next morning, the group next goes to the ranch of their father's friend, Mr. Mason (Ben Johnson), whose property lies far enough outside Calumet to go unnoticed. Mason informs the boys that a large portion of the central United States has been occupied by Soviet and Cuban forces and they are all 40 miles behind enemy lines. Beyond the Soviet/Cuban front lies ""FA"" or ""Free America"". They also tell Robert that his father was killed by the enemy; while gathering their supplies at his father's store before fleeing to the mountains, the group also took several rifles. The Soviet authorities had Robert's father publicly executed for providing insurgents (the boys) with weapons. Mason doesn't know what happened to Robert's mother. Robert breaks down and a distressed Jed feels obvious guilt for their deaths. Mason tells the boys that they are not at fault and that the lesson learned from the incident (symbolizing that of US government registration of privately-owned firearms) should sink in to them all. Before they leave, Mason gives them a radio and also asks that the boys take his teenage granddaughters with them. The two new additions are Toni (Jennifer Grey) and her sister Erica (Lea Thompson) who ride back to the camp with them.Meanwhile, Daryl's father, Calumet's mayor, Bates (Lane Smith), a collaborationist of sorts, tries to appease the occupation authorities under Colonel Bella. He offers his assistance in getting the citizens of his town to adhere to the new laws that Bella imposes.Back in the woods, the group hears a radio announcement from the Free Zone that tells them the war is far from over (""John has a long mustache"") and the combat is at a standstill (""The chair is against the wall""). The next day, the group sees a Russian patrol of three soldiers headed toward their position. While taking in the sites, the patrol sees the group and attempts to arrest them. Jed, Robert & the others kill them all. Robert later talks of his enjoyment of killing them, probably seeking revenge for the deaths of his parents. Jed remarks that they cannot return to town ever again because they'll be hunted.In reprisal, Colonel Bella orders the killing of several of the town's residents after they dig graves for the dead Soviets. A mass execution takes place, one that Matt witnesses from a distance. Among those killed are his and Arturo's fathers. Also present is Daryl's father, who is visibly sickened. Jed later tells everyone not to cry over their families' deaths.In retaliation, the teens continue their guerrilla campaign, dubbing themselves ""Wolverines"" after their high school football team's mascot. They ambush Soviet and Cuban patrols, shoot up armored columns, and raid local armories to steal weapons such as AK-47 rifles, sniper rifles, land mines, RPG launchers, among many other weapons.A month later, Erica, while on patrol, sees a pilot land nearby by parachute. The pilot is an Air Force Colonel, named Andy Tanner (Powers Boothe), who joins the team and fills them in on the events of the war. The occupying forces are made up of Cuban and Soviet commando forces who invaded from both Mexico and Canada. The Soviet forces crossed into Alaska (cutting the Alaska oil pipeline). Tactical nuclear weapons were used to take out key U.S. nuclear missile and communication locations. However, by this time the front lines of combat have mostly stabilized. Tanner tells the teens that the United States' only allies are Great Britain, who are suffering huge defeats, and about 600 million Chinese. When Daryl says that China's population is supposed to be over one billion, Tanner implies that they've been defeated by the Soviets as well, perhaps by mass slaughter in combat or by nuclear weapons.The team invites the Colonel to join their guerrilla efforts. Tanner also teaches them basic tactics for attacking larger targets; they attack an airbase located near the re-education camp. They free the prisoners and destroy a few key military targets. Tanner later notices Robert carving hash marks into the stock of his AK-47 rifle for every enemy soldier he kills. Tanner tells the boy that ""all that killing is gonna burn you up inside."" Robert replies, ""Yeah, but it keeps me warm.""Jed takes Tanner to meet Mr. Mason where he tells them both that there are rumors of the Soviets dropping special forces units into the occupied zone to hunt the Wolverines. There is also talk of sending in American Special Forces troops to aide them. Jed believes their only chance to survive the war is to cross the front lines into Free America. Tanner decides to show them the way out of the occupied territory.They go to the front lines of combat where an M1 Abrams American tank is engaged in a fierce battle with a few Soviet T-62 tanks. Tanner tells Jed that they'll have to cross the no-man's land between the tanks to reach the free zone where Soviet jets are dropping napalm. As they prepare to move forward, another Soviet tank moves up to their position, unaware that Tanner and the team are nearby. The tank begins to fire on the American tank and Tanner sees an opportunity to disable the enemy. In the skirmish, Arturo is killed and Tanner is critically wounded by a grenade. Before he succumbs to his injuries, he is able to mark the tank with a colored smoke bomb, making it visible to the American forces. They destroy the tank and Tanner along with it. Back in camp, Erica becomes deeply depressed over his loss, having been attracted to him. A small funeral is held for Tanner and Arturo. Their names are carved by the team into a nearby rock as a memorial.Meanwhile, Colonel Bella and his superior, the Russian Cossack Major General Bratchenko (Vladek Sheybal), call in a Soviet special forces team to hunt the Wolverines. Before they move in, their commander, Major Strelnikov (William Smith), orders the forces in the area to cease their reprisals and atrocities against the local population, saying terror tactics like those will not win the conflict for them in the long term.The Soviet commandos move into the mountains, using a tracking device to find the Wolverines, however, the teens are waiting for them and kill most of the commandos. One is left alive and is interrogated by the group. They discover the tracking device, which reveals that the Daryl is a traitor, having stolen away from the team and into town to see his father despite Jed's strictest orders. While there, he had been forced to swallow a tracing bug and reveal his and his friends' location in the mountains. The team makes a tough decision to execute both Daryl and the Soviet prisoner. Jed, enraged by the Soviet invasion, kills the soldier and turns his gun on Daryl, but is unable to kill him. Robert steps up and very casually and coldly shoots Daryl, leaving the team horrified at his callousness in executing a friend.By March of the following year, after five months of fighting, the Wolverines are physically and emotionally weakened, however, by the attacks and other events, and their morale erodes as the war of attrition continues. Even though the American civilians are increasingly resistant to Soviet rule, the occupation forces are pushing the resistance of the Wolverines to the breaking point.A few days later, while observing a small detachment of Soviet vehicles, Jed notices that they drop a few cartons of food and calls off their attack. They scrounge what's there and take it back to their camp. However, apparently the food had somehow been bugged and three heavily armed Soviet Mi-24 Hind helicopters move in and attack the group. Toni is shot immediately and is taken to cover by Jed. The rest of the group also scatter on their horses and try to make it to cover, however, Robert's horse is shot out from under him. He makes a final stand, damaging one Mi-24 chopper with an RPG, killing the door gunner, and firing his rifle at a second. He is killed in a hail of gunfire. After the three Soviet helicopters leave the scene, Jed and the seriously wounded Toni share a final moment and Jed leaves her a grenade. Later, when Soviet ground troops arrive and find her dead body, the grenade that had been left live under her goes off, killing at least one Russian soldier with it.Jed adds Toni's and Robert's names to those already on the memorial rock. Tired and demoralized by the loss of their friends, Jed and Matt prepare a suicidal attack on the Soviet headquarters in Calumet itself which will serve as a diversion allowing Erica and Danny to escape to Free America. During the climactic final battle, many Soviet, Cuban, and enemy soldiers and officers are killed during the fighting. Jed and Matt kill Bratchenko and blow up his communications trailer with RPG's. While trying to escape on a nearby train, Matt is shot by the pursuing Strelnikov. Jed sneaks up on Strelnikov and the two shoot each other simultaneously at close range. Strelnikov is killed and Jed is wounded in his side. Colonel Bella sees Jed holding his brother, but does not shoot them and lets him pass. Jed takes his fatally wounded brother to a bench in the town's empty, snowy park square and cradles him as he dies. Jed refuses to leave the dead Matt behind and stays, holding his dead brother while waiting to die from his own wounds or for the Soviet troops to find and finish him off. At the same time, Bella, equally war weary and hoping to leave the prolonged conflict, returns to his office headquarters and finishes writing out a letter of resignation from the Cuban Army.The film closes with Erica and Danny being the only two survivors of the original team. They make their way to Free America territory in the Great Plains. Erica narrates the final scene of the film, saying that the war eventually ended many years later. She adds that she often visits a memorial to their friends called ""Partisan Rock"", but no one else ever visits. The memorial has an inscription that invokes the words of Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Address. The memorial, its inscription, and the presence of an American flag indicate America won the war.The plaque reads: ""In the early days of World War III, guerrillas - mostly children - placed the names of their lost upon this rock. They fought here alone and gave up their lives, so that this nation should not perish from the earth."""

From a humble background, he is competent at his job as a lawyer at Burton Schuyler's prestigious firm, but is unsatisfied working on behalf of rich people and the problems of the one percent. Although he would rather eke out a life as a musician if he could, he would be more satisfied as a lawyer if he made partner and got better cases. While Roger always bringing his dog Bix to the office does not instill much confidence for Burton in Roger as partner material, Roger seriously dating Burton's daughter, Peggy Schuyler, may give him a path to partner, especially if he and Peggy get married.

Now, Edwina has control about the right half of Roger's body, his soul about only the left half. They struggle together to get her soul into the right body, but not without having some conflicts between themselves to solve.—Julian Reischl <julianreischl@mac.com> At the law offices of Schuylar Mifflin, Roger Cobb (Steve Martin) is a lawyer with eleven years behind him, and no future ahead of him. He is running himself ragged working into the evening, and his cases are of no consequence because he has not committed to the practice. His true passion is playing guitar in the Fulton Norris (Gailard Sartain) Orchestra, and after falling asleep at his desk he comes to just in time to rush to a nightclub gig and perform his solo, but he eventually falls asleep again onstage.On the morning of his 38th birthday, his girlfriend Peggy Schuyler (Madolyn Smith) brings him an African grave post for a present. They discuss ""the m word"" briefly, but Roger seems disinterested in marriage. He is late to work at the law firm, which is her father's, and he was hired as a favor, in spite of being perceived as carrying on his family's misguided standards. On the way to the office, Roger and his canine companion Bix stop by a corner where their blind musician buddy Tyrone Wattell (Jason Bernard) is playing his saxophone for tips. Roger tells Tyrone he has decided to quit his gig and work on law full time. Tyrone tells him it is a mistake to give up his music, but wishes him well.At a palatial estate, Doctor Betty Ahrens (Peggy Feury) informs her frail millionaire patient Edwina Cutwater (Lily Tomlin) that after years of disability because of her chronic heart trouble, she is finally and truly dying. Edwina calls Schuyler Mifflin to speak with senior partner Burton Schuyler (Dana Elcar) to put her final affairs in order. Burton is having an affair with Gretchen (Neva Patterson), and he interrupts their merrymaking to take her call, as Gretchen informs him that his wife subpoenaed her to appear at the divorce hearing.Roger arrives at his office and his secretary Margot (Selma Diamond) reads off his client phone messages before he is summoned to Burton's office. Roger asks Burton for a partnership, saying he has quit the band and is buying a vest later in the day. Intrigued by his attitude, Burton sends him to the Cutwater estate to test his mettle, noting that if Roger is up to the task, his future in the firm is secure.Roger arrives to see Edwina in her wheelchair ordering her staff around, and she treats him as if he were a hired hand. When she learns who he is, she tells Roger she plans to leave her entire multi-million dollar estate to Terry Hoskins (Victoria Tennant), the vibrant daughter of the stable hand Fred Hoskins (Eric Christmas), and Roger will handle the paperwork. He also learns that Terry will actually inherit nothing, as Edwina has hired a guru named Prahka Lasa (Richard Libertini) to transport her soul into Terry's healthy body so she can have a chance at a normal life. Prahka speaks only parroted English and carries a metal bowl with him which will be a vessel for Edwina's soul when her death is imminent. Roger suggests that her will would be contested if she is not considered of sound mind, and Edwina, spoiled and used to getting her way, insults him. He declares her and her companions crazy, and Edwina slaps him, threatening to tattle to Burton about his undesirable behavior. When Roger talks back to her and leaves, Edwina issues orders to the staff for her car and jewelry to wear as she plans to go out. Terry tells Roger she is willing to give up everything to become one with the universe, but he scoffs.When Roger returns to the firm, Margot reveals that Edwina is already there in a board meeting with Burton and the firm's other partner Mr. Mifflin (Michael Ensign). The doctor, Terry and Prahka stand by as Edwina's attitude goads Roger into more arguing, but when Burton pulls him aside and they step out of the office, he laughs off the conflict and agrees that she must be out of her mind to believe in reincarnation.After Roger leaves, Edwina suddenly says she sees a bright light and collapses, while the doctor makes futile attempts to revive her and Prahka sets up the bowl on its stand and he and Terry begin chanting. The bowl spins atop its pole, then settles as if something were inside. During the confusion, the doctor pushes Burton and he bumps the vessel, which goes out the window. As the doctor declares they have lost Edwina, the bowl lands on Roger as he emerges from the building, hitting him in the head. He tries to get up from the pavement as Edwina's voice says she feels different. He stumbles as if his body were not his own. Looking in a car's side mirror, Roger is horrified to see Edwina staring back at him, and they realize that her soul has entered his body by accident. Bix barks at Roger, perceiving the change in his human companion. They struggle to walk properly, and it appears that Edwina is in control of his right side and he his left. Finally they manage to coordinate their gait and return to the building, but before they can go to the office to find Prahka and reverse the error, Roger realizes he needs to use the restroom. Mifflin sees that Roger seems to be acting strangely. The newly merged pair make their way to the men's room.At the urinal, Roger has to coordinate the act of relieving himself with Edwina, who has trouble using his right hand under her control, unfamiliar as she is with men's clothing and genitals. Her grip sends him staggering and in pain, but with coaching from Roger and resignation on Edwina's part, they manage the task. Behind them a curious Mifflin observes Roger speaking in a feminized mashup of Edwina's and his own voice, before she finally tells him that she can read his thoughts and they successfully and quietly finish their bathroom break. In the hallway, Roger admits to Mifflin he was talking to himself. Terry approaches as Mifflin leaves, and says Prahka has left.Burton calls Roger into his office to handle his own divorce case. He confesses that he originally cheated on his wife to comfort a grieving widow, but then so many women found him attractive that he could not stop, and he wants defense from somebody he can trust. Roger reluctantly agrees to take the case.Returning to his office, Edwina tells Roger to look for the phone number to the Ambassador Hotel where Prahka is staying. At the hotel, Prahka is out of his element, having lived his entire life in Tibet with no luxuries, but he discovers the toilet and flushes it just as Roger places the phone call, and the phone in the other room rings. Believing the flush causes the ringing, the curious Prahka operates the lever until the ringing stops when Roger hangs up. Peggy arrives at the office and overhears Roger as he and Edwina resume the argument aloud about the bathroom episode. Believing he is cheating on her, Peggy storms in and demands an explanation. Edwina overrides Roger and throws in her opinion as he tries to tell her what happened, and she mishears Roger as saying he had sex with the dead body of Edwina. She is also mad that he is siding with her father in the divorce case and gives him the ultimatum of either herself or his manhood. He picks the latter and Peggy leaves, saying their relationship is over.Determined to find Prahka, Roger tries to drive with Edwina, while Bix shows hostility toward her being in Roger's body, so he decides to not inconvenience his canine friend and drops the dog off with Tyrone for safekeeping. When Tyrone questions Roger, he relates what happened, and incredibly he believes him. Roger introduces Edwina to Tyrone, and she offers her right hand, forgetting it belongs to Roger. Tyrone kisses it and says he is happy to help because, though he considers Roger a bit strange, he is a true friend.At the memorial service for Edwina, the church is empty but for the presiding cleric and choir, but her oxygen provider and other health aid companies sent mail-grams of condolence. Roger falls asleep in the pew, and Edwina with him. After midnight Terry arrives, and he realizes that he has full control of his body while Edwina sleeps, and he tells Terry everything. She says that if she is going to surrender her body for Edwina, Roger could do her the favor of a last memorable night of passion, so they go to his place and start making love. Suddenly Edwina wakes up and is stunned to see what is happening, but Terry enjoys her retorts as a form of rough foreplay, even enjoying Edwina's attempts to spank her. Despite pleas from Roger, Edwina puts an end to the evening. Terry leaves, realizing that Edwina is indeed inside Roger. When Roger mentions that it was unfair to deprive him of happiness since nobody likely wanted to have sex with Edwina, she says she was always proud to have saved herself. She then breaks down and confesses that she had no friends in her lifetime, which explained the lack of attendees at her memorial. She tells a sad childhood story of a cruel clown who refused to perform for her, and of watching Terry doing all the things she could not as she watched from bed, miserable to be on the sidelines. They reach an understanding, and Roger lets her sleep while he studies the case for Burton.Next morning, after no sleep, Roger tries the hotel again, but Prahka simply ignores the phone and resumes flushing the toilet. Edwina exercises for a groggy Roger and helps him perform his morning routine, saying she looks forward to having a new body. Roger's court appearance is at 8:30 and the funeral is at 10:30, but Roger says he will work it out.At court Burton appears to be losing his case, and Roger falls asleep with Edwina unable to wake him, so she improvises, trying to speak in a lower voice and adapt male mannerisms, but she chooses rude behaviors like hawking and spitting, scratching his crotch and blowing a snot rocket, to the discomfort of the courtroom. She asks Burton about the expensive gifts he gave to the women he was accused of cheating with on his wife, saying that gifting clients was a commonplace business expense. The attorney for his wife says the money was from his personal and not the firm's account, placing the testimony in danger, so a stymied Edwina screams mentally to Roger to wake him up, and he startles back to consciousness. When he asks for and hears the repeat of the court clerk's notes, Roger triumphantly equates Burton's gifts to a perpetual gratuity based on the firm's success and his own salary, which equally supported his own wife in a consistently grand manner. The judge overrules the objection by the other attorney, but when Roger brags mentally to himself that none of Burton's women were clients, Edwina realizes the defense is unfair and blurts it out to the judge before Roger can stop her. Burton fires Roger, the judge fines him for contempt and has him tossed out of the room. Edwina says he is better off not being a lawyer who works against the ideals his family instilled in him, and while married to a woman like Peggy, but he is furious at his unraveled life.Terry puts Prahka into a taxi and pays the driver $200 to stay with him until he is aboard his late night flight back to Tibet. Roger meets her at the funeral, and Edwina sees that Roger has arranged for Tyrone and the orchestra to follow her hearse in an old fashioned New Orleans style procession. When Roger borrows a compact mirror from Terry he sees Edwina is crying with happiness, grateful for what she says is the best gift from the best friend she ever had. Terry demurs when Roger asks if Prahka will show up, and they go to the hotel to check on him. They end up trying again to make love until Edwina thinks of old nuns to kill the mood. Stepping into the restroom, Edwina says she doesn't want to sit in on their sexual exploits, but Roger convinces her to enjoy herself as she starts to pick up on the arousal that is starting to overwhelm their shared body. Prahka then returns from the airport unexpectedly, and upon seeing that Edwina is in Roger's body, he readies the bowl, but Terry dresses to leave, saying Roger must be crazy to think she will give up her body and the inheritance that she now owns.Upset that she made a mistake with Terry, Edwina asks Prahka to give Roger his body back, saying he can put her soul into another creature, but Roger is determined to help her, because his family instilled that sense of justice in him, and refuses. She enjoys being selfless for the first time in her life.Back at the Cutwater estate, Terry orders her father to shower and dress in a tuxedo for her party as the orchestra arrives with two new members-Roger and Prahka--and Bix in a guide harness with Tyrone. At rehearsal, Edwina admires Roger for being such a good musician, and says he should play full time, but she has trouble letting him play his guitar solo, and the rehearsal breaks up. Near the stables, Roger and Prahka wait for Terry to ride in and dismount her horse, and ambush her as Prahka puts Edwina in the bowl. Terry struggles with them, the horse kicks the bowl and it lands in a bucket of water. The bowl is dented, so Prahka needs to fix it before he can get Edwina out of the water, so Roger escapes and creates several distractions as Terry sends guards to pursue him. He puts the water into a glass pitcher, gives it to Tyrone, and refills the bucket with tap water, pausing sadly to see his own reflection in the mirror as Edwina is not with him, then runs with the guards in pursuit until he feigns clumsiness and dumps the bucket into some flowers. He then sees Terry with the pitcher. She pours the contents into a nearby flower bed and calls off the guards, saying Roger is no longer a threat.A sad Roger meets up with Tyrone, who apologizes for not being able to see when the pitcher was taken. Roger relates that he misses the old girl, and Tyrone answers with a retort in Edwina's voice, revealing that he drank the water with her in it. They find Prahka, who has fixed the bowl, and Roger asks Prahka to move Edwina out of Tyrone into him again, as he is the only safe place.The trio and Bix then approach the house after the party and try to sneak in, but Terry prepares a pistol when she hears noises and surprises them, leading them to another room while she tries to concoct a story before she does away with them. The room she chooses has Burton and Gretchen in it, and in the unexpected discovery a scuffle ensues and Roger wrests the gun from her. When Burton says she will be arrested for attempted murder, she says she refuses to surrender as it will be her third conviction and she will go to jail, so she bargains with Edwina. With Fred looking on, Prahka succeeds in placing Edwina into Terry's body, while Terry takes over the body of her favorite horse, whom Fred promises to look after for the rest of her life.In the grand hall, Edwina, now in Terry's body, tells Roger she is scared that now she has no excuses and has what she has always wanted. Roger says he has decided to give up law, and as they enter the ballroom floor he offers to teach her to dance. The mirror reflects the real Edwina sharing her first dance and new life with her new best friend."

Places in the Heart,1984,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087921/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"In central Texas in the 1930s, a widow with two small children tries to save her small 40-acre farm with the help of a blind boarder and an itinerant black handyman. Edna Spalding finds herself alone and broke on a small farm in the midst of the Great Depression when her husband, the Sheriff, is killed in an accident. Moses, a wandering Black man,helps her plant cotton to try to keep her farm and family together. She also takes in a blind boarder, Mr. Will, who lost his sight in the Great War. She must endure storms and harsh labor to try to make her mortgage payment on time.—Susan Southall <stobchatay@aol.com> In 1935 rural Texas, recently-widowed Edna Spaulding struggles to survive with two small children, a farm to run and very little money in the bank--not to mention a deadly tornado and the unwelcome presence of the Ku Klux Klan. Edna is aided by her beautician sister Margaret, blind boarder Mr. Will, and Moze, a would-be thief who decides to stick around to teach Edna how to plant and harvest cotton.—Jwelch5742 Spring 1935, Waxahachie, Texas. Edna Spalding, mother to young Frank and Possum Spalding, is ill-equipped, thus ill-prepared, to handle many of the family responsibilities following the accidental workplace death of her husband, the town's sheriff, Royce Spalding. Chief among these responsibilities is being the family breadwinner and managing the family finances--including making the next mortgage payment on their farm in October. Rather than heed the advice of the banker Albert Denby to sell the farm despite the depressed market, Edna will do whatever she must to keep herself and her kids in what they know as their home. On unsolicited advice from a Black stranger, beggar Moze Hadner, Edna decides to farm cotton--about which she knows nothing--to earn enough to make that mortgage payment. Despite something that Moze does against her, Edna hires him to be her sole farmhand. Also adding a small amount to the household finances is her new boarder, whom Mr. Denby actually foists off on her: her blind, loner brother-in-law Will, who otherwise would be institutionalized. As a collective they must contend with the depressed market, Mother Nature, racial tensions within the segregated community, and other issues, to get the crop to market to make that payment, with determination, love and support which may keep them going after a rough start between the Spaldings and the two new men in their lives. Meanwhile, the issue of spousal dependency touches not only Edna, but also her sister Margaret Lomax, who loves her husband Wayne but is unaware that he is having an affair with his friend Buddy Kelsey's schoolteacher wife Viola Kelsey.—Huggo Set in 1935 Waxahachie, Texas, PLACES IN THE HEART tells a story -- not unlike the familiar story told by the film ""It's A Wonderful Life"" -- of the delicate balance one life can exert upon so many others. When Sheriff Royce Spalding is accidentally killed by a drunken gunman, his wife, Edna, is suddenly thrust into the role of provider for her two small children, Frank and Possum. Then ""Mose,"" an out-of-work black man begging for every meal in the racist South of the Depression era, happens along with a scheme to plant cotton on her forty acres. It is the only chance Edna has to keep her family together. Meanwhile, Mr. Denby, of the bank which owns the mortgage on the farm, is quick to extend a ""hand of charity"" to Mrs. Spalding by depositing his blind brother-in-law (Mr. Will) with her for safekeeping. Margaret, Edna's sister and a local ""beauty operator,"" is unable to provide much help; her beauty shop is all that stands between herself, her philandering husband, and a small daughter on one side and poverty on the other. A tornado offers their first challenge. Emerging from the storm cellar, blind Mr. Will asks ""How bad is it?"" ""Well,"" Mose responds, ""everything's a little bent, but it's still here."" Next, the bottom falls out of the cotton market and Edna's only chance to make the mortgage payment is that she be first to bring her crop to the cotton mill and claim the $100 first prize for doing so. In her way is the local chapter of the Ku Klux Klan which objects to Mose's efforts to best a white man to the prize money. In spite of the church setting of the final scene of the film, it seems karmic in its implications.—Mark Fleetwood <mfleetwo@mail.coin.missouri.edu> It is Sunday afternoon on March 31, 1935 in Waxahachie, Texas, a small town some 40 miles south of Dallas. During the opening credits, a popular Protestant church hymn ""Blessed Assurance"" is playing, giving the audience glimpses of the central Texas prairie, people leaving church, having lunch in a restaurant, Sunday dinner at home, a homeless black man going up to a door for a meal, a homeless woman living in her car, and abject poverty nearly all blacks were forced to live in due to the segregation and discrimination laws. The hymn ends with Royce Spaulding, the town sheriff, saying grace for he and his family. During the lunch meal prayer, there are gun shots being fired outside. Sheriff Spaulding is summoned by a deputy that a drunken young negro Wylie is firing shots. The young man accidentally fires his gun shooting the sheriff in the chest and killing him instantly. Soon after his body is brought into the home, local vigilantes have dragged the body of Wylie to his death and displaying to Edna Spaulding outside her home reminding her that negro's killing whites will never go unpunished, even if accidental. Her sister Margaret arrives and tells them to leave.Meanwhile, an affair has been going on between Edna Spaulding's brother in law, Wayne Lomax, and teacher Viola Kelsey at an abandoned shack on the prairie. Edna and her sister, Margaret Lomax are preparing the body of her husband for the funeral and have the wake at Edna's house with numerous people attending and bringing potluck food. Margaret tries to comfort Edna with Edna unsure about what she will do to support the family because she has never worked outside the home and knew nothing about her husband's finances.At dusk, the hanged body of Wylie has been recovered by family members and the next day we are shown the very simple, bluesy funeral of Wylie's burial in a pine box in a segregated negro cemetery of homemade wood markers, whereas the funeral of Edna's husband is very elaborate in comparison and nicely done at a church and cemetery. Soon after the funeral and after the last mourners leave the house, a homeless black man named Moze comes to Edna's home if she has any work for him. Edna tells her she can fix him a plate of food, but then needs to leave.The next morning, Edna hears wood being chopped outside in her yard. Moze is still around. She tells him once again she can make him a plate of food, but then needs to leave. Moze tells her about all kinds of handyman projects that can be done around the house and while doing so, he sneaks a set of silverware to steal.Local banker Albert Denby makes a trip to Edna's home and tells her the situation of the debt on the home and that she may need to sell her home and move in with relatives in order to make ends meet. Edna refuses and is determined to keep her homestead and children and find a way to make ends meet.That night, a local sheriff brings Moze to Edna's home having caught him with the stolen silverware and Moze claiming to work for her. Edna defends Moze to the sheriff telling him he didn't go with the silverware where he was supposed to. Edna now sees an opportunity to hire Moze inquiring him how much he knows about cotton farming, but also assures him she will shoot him herself if he ever tries to steal from her again.Edna makes a trip to the downtown bank and asks Mr. Denby if he can teach her how to write a check and she also tells him she has hired a negro man to help out that is giving her tips on how to make money cotton farming. Mr. Denby dismisses her idea as very wrong and ignorant hiring a negro and that many white property owners have sold their homes or been foreclosed on. Edna stands her ground that she is moving forward.On April 5, Edna and Moze are at Mr. Simmons' Cotton Gin to purchase seed for a cotton crop. Moze spots right away she's being sold a lower grade seed for higher grade price and Edna tells Mr. Simmons it's the wrong seed. Mr. Simmons berates and intimidates Moze for his ""honest mistake"" and gives Edna the higher quality seed.Moze is back at Edna's place nailing good luck charms on the barn he is sleeping in. He's mumbling to himself about how he could have been killed for speaking up. Edna's son Frank introduces himself to Moze while he's working. Moze refuses to warm up to the boy at first, but Frank is more than happy to help him work and assist him.Mr. Denby makes a trip back to Edna's home introducing his brother Will, a blind World War 1 veteran that he offers to live with her and pay her room and board per month. Despite Mr. Denby trying to butter Will up and Edna trying to be friendly and make small talk with Will, he is reluctant and tersely tells Edna he just wants his space and not to be felt sorry for.There is a dance going on at an old white wood frame house with a group called The Lone Star Syrup Boys playing and many townspeople attending. Wayne gets home from work and he and Margaret make love. They arrive late at the dance with Buddy and Viola Kelsey having been concerned about them. Viola is now upset and keeps a distance from Wayne because she knows he still loves his wife and has sex with her.Back at the Spaulding place, Frank and Possum sneak into Mr. Will's bedroom and play the story ""Trent's Last Case"" on his victrola. Edna calls the kids almost immediately and in a state of panic, Frank runs the needle across the record scratching it, putting it back in its case, and coming downstairs.Some moments later, Edna is preparing herself a hot bath in a galvanized steel tub and Mr. Will storms into her room angrily not realizing she's naked and bathing yelling at her feeling humiliated, that he would love to leave her house if there were other choices, and is furious about her children going through his things. She stands up for her kids, he hits the water in the tub and is now embarrassed. He exits the room.At dawn, Edna and Moze begin plowing the 30 acres of land to begin the cotton crop. There is also a brief scene of the Lone Star Syrup Boys tired and on the road.Viola is outside at the schoolhouse during recess and Wayne drives by staring and flirting with her. She's distressed at this and goes to the back of the schoolhouse about to light an Old Gold cigarette. Several boys, including Frank Spaulding, are behind the school sneaking a cigarette and get caught.Viola brings Frank home from school and very reluctantly Edna decides to administer punishment. Frank tells her that he would have received ""ten good licks"" from his father. She follows through with it in the pantry and Frank manages to save face during the punishment. Edna is very upset by having done it and confesses it to Mr. Will.Margaret is at her home beauty shop tending to a customer and it's getting darker, radio static, and lights flickering despite being the afternoon. At the same time, Moze is working in the fields and sees a tornado coming through. Viola leads her school to the back of the classroom using a piano as a shield. Frank runs to his home. The woman living in her car tries to get Frank to come to safety in the vehicle, but he refuses. At Margaret's home, a customer shuts a window with it shattering and small shards of glass hitting her in the face. Moze gets the family to safety in the cellar and Frank makes it in time. Part of the schoolhouse is torn off and many other homes are totally destroyed.After the tornado is over, there is only minor damage of the Spaulding place that can be fixed in days, but the schoolhouse is badly damaged and the woman in her car was killed with the car turned upside down. Viola's husband Buddy comes to the rescue. After seeing the damage she pleads with him to leave town for the city because of the poverty and frequency of tornados.It is now September and Edna is in the kitchen preparing breakfast and Mr. Will turns on the radio with the farm and livestock report. It is announced that cotton is now at an all time low of 3.5 cents a pound.Back at the bank, Edna is pleading to Mr. Denby if somehow the payment of the house can be deferred, as she owes over $150, but only has $24 in her account. Mr. Denby goes to ask his boss, the president of the bank, if it can be done. In the background he shakes his head no. Edna looks at a series of photographs of people bringing in the first bale of cotton a year receiving an additional $100. Edna sees this as an opportunity to be able to make the payment, hire some workers, and still have some money leftover.The cotton is ready to be picked. Moze totally dismisses Edna's proposal to get the cotton picked as quick as possible and get the first bale in. He warns her that the toil from picking the cotton and cuts on her hands will be unbearable. Edna does not back down and tells Moze if they don't do it that he will be back to begging for meals, Mr. Will will be forced to live in a state home, and she and her kids will be separated and lose the homestead.The Lomax and Kelsey couples are at the Lomax home playing cards. Buddy Kelsey announces to them he and Violet are moving to Houston. There is some considerable tension between Wayne and Viola throughout the night. Wayne makes a pass at Viola attempting to grab a set of cards out of her hand and she pulls away. Margaret spots this and knows something is not right. Buddy and Viola leave and Margaret slaps Wayne in the face knowing he's been sleeping with Viola and tells him she doesn't love him and wants a divorce.Edna, Moze, Frank, and Possum are all picking cotton in the hot sun for hours with Edna getting cuts on her fingers from the hulls. Moze is annoyed by all this thinking it won't work. After having finished four acres, Edna inquires with Moze about hiring pickers. Ten is what they should have. She leaves it to Moze to hire them and risk losing money if she doesn't get the first bale in.The next morning, ten men, women, and children are at the door hired to pick cotton. Edna feeds them a breakfast of cornbread and tea. Afterwards, they go to work. Mr. Will hears several truckloads of people passing through and announces to Moze someone else trying to get ahead of getting the first bale in. Moze tells the workers they need to go faster and have only 3 days left. Edna is struggling to retain her strength and dignity.A country instrumental version of La Golindrina is playing with Edna and her husband dancing. She wakes up from a dream and it is early morning with Mr. Will in the kitchen picking string beans. Edna is stiff, exhausted, and telling him of her dream while still half asleep. She realizes there is only one day left to pick cotton.It is night and oil lanterns have been set up so they can pick cotton. Wayne and Margaret have joined in to speed it up. Mr. Will is on one of the cotton wagons listening to Trent's Last Case on his victrola outside while they finish.A beyond-exhausted Edna is crawling through the cotton fields searching for more cotton to pick with Moze giving her the good news they have now finished.Edna and Moze are parked at Mr. Simmons' cotton gin awaiting his arrival. Moze is giving her instructions on how to bargain with him. Mr. Simmons arrives and tells Edna he needs to charge a fee to gin the cotton, which Moze told her otherwise not to accept. She requests for 4.5 cents a pound, despite the 3.5 cents that was recent on market prices. Mr. Simmons gets tough and insists he will give her 2.75, she drops it to 4. He finally bargains with 3.5 and says there is no way he can go higher. He asks her to leave and take her business elsewhere. She looks at the picture on his desk, which was one of the pictures in the bank earlier and reminds Mr. Simmons that this will probably be the first year he does not get the first bale of cotton for the season and that another dealer might just go for the same price she requested. He tersely asks her to sit down.Edna comes out of Mr. Simmons' office. She managed to get the cotton up to 3.75 cents a pound and a received nice check for it. She's still somewhat dissatisfied and believes they could have done more, but Moze insists they would have died from overwork.Edna is sitting in her kitchen now repairing a set of work shoes and somewhat at peace and Mr. Will approaches her asking for a cup of tea. He reluctantly asks her a question as to what she looks like. She goes over the details of her personal appearance with him comparing herself to other relatives. Then the teapot whistles and his tea is ready.Edna, her children, and Wayne and Margaret Lomax go to a town dance at an outdoor shed. The Lonestar Syrup Boys are performing once again playing La Golindrina. Frank asks his mother Edna to dance with him. There are still tensions between Wayne and Margaret, they dance together, and he's still trying to make up with her. Buddy and Viola Kelsey are also at the dance with a still jealous Viola watching Wayne and Margaret dance.Back at the Spaulding farm, Mr. Will is caning a chair and hanging out with Moze with Moze discussing the success of Edna's bargaining with the cotton buyer. He hears some activity going on in the back, but Moze dismisses it. But he goes outside to check on what's going on. There are four Ku Klux Klansmen that go after Moze beating him. Mr. Will steps outside with Sheriff Spaulding's gun threatening the klansmen to leave. He identifies the men as customers of his he knows and Mr. Simmons, the cotton buyer, who is obviously outraged at having been cheated out of money by Edna because of Moze's instructions to her on how to bargain with him and taking it out on Moze. Mr. Will shoots the gun, the men leave, and Mr. Simmons assures Moze he is not yet finished with him.Edna is back home rushing to Moze at what has happened. He's in the barn having cleaned it and packed his belongings. He has cuts and bruises on his face from the beatings. He tells her he needs to leave before the klansmen come back. She worries that he'll be killed and won't be able to manage without him. But Moze knows he needs to leave. He gives Edna small gifts he wants she and her children to have. She is saddened at his leaving, but reassures him that he was the one that made it happen by tilling her land, planting the cotton, and bringing in the first cotton crop in the county for the year and his race had nothing to do with it. Moze accepts her compliment and leaves.Back at the church, the choir is once again singing ""Blessed Assurance"". Bud and Viola Kelsey are now leaving town passing by the church. The pastor gives a brief sermon about love to the small congregation. Margaret takes Wayne by the hand assuring him of forgiveness. During communion, the choir sings ""In the Garden"". During this scene, the elements of bread and wine are passed from person to person in a now large congregation dressed casually and in their Sunday Best telling each other ""Peace of God"". Included in this are The Lonestar Syrup Boys, the woman killed in her car during the tornado, Mr. Denby, Moze, and finally Sheriff Spaulding saying ""Peace of God"" to Wylie, the young negro boy that accidentally killed him. It is a symbolic scene indicating the ""New Heaven and Earth"" in the Bible that poverty, racism, oppression, and hatred is all gone and that love and forgiveness are now the rule."

When the American forces leave, Dith Pran sends his family with them, but stays behind himself to help Schanberg cover the event. As an American, Schanberg won't have any trouble leaving the country, but the situation is different for Pran; he's a local, and the Khmer Rouge are moving in.—Murray Chapman <muzzle@cs.uq.oz.au> In 1973, NYTimes reporter,Sydney Schanberg's sent to Cambodia, whereDith Pran's set up as Schanberg's interpreter/guide. Over the next few years, the men and their families, become friends. When the US forces pull out, Schanberg's able to get exit visas for Pran's family. Soon, the Khmer Rouge take control, and Schanberg and other western journalists are evacuated. Once in New York, Schanberg and his colleagues attempt to evacuate Pran, as his life's in even more danger from the Khmer Rouge, and so begins Schanberg's 4.5-year campaign to get Pran out of the country,—Huggo The film opens in May 1973 in Phnom Penh, the capital city of Cambodia. The Cambodian national army is fighting a civil war with the communist Khmer Rouge, a result of the Vietnam War over-spilling that country's borders. Dith Pran (Haing S. Ngor), a Cambodian journalist and interpreter for New York Times reporter Sydney Schanberg (Sam Waterson), awaits the arrival of Schanberg at the Phnom Penh airport when he leaves suddenly. Schanberg arrives after his flight is delayed for three hours in Bangkok, Thailand, and, irritated that Pran is not at the airport, takes a taxi to his hotel. There he meets Al Rockoff (John Malkovich), his photographer. Rockoff doesn't know where to find Pran and suggests they go to a nearby cafe to eat. While they sit and talk, an explosion happens nearby. Al thinks a passing scooter's passenger threw a grenade, though the target isn't actually revealed. Pran suddenly arrives and tells Schanberg that an incident has occurred in a remote town, Neak Leung. Allegedly, an American B-52 has bombed the town by mistake.After talking to the United States Consul at the American embassy and finding out that the reports about Neak Leung are true, Schanberg and Pran try to find transport to the site. Pran is able to sneak himself and Sydney onto a police boat that takes them to Neak Leung. When they arrive, they find that the town has indeed been bombed and hundreds of local civilians have been killed, with many more wounded, including women and children. Schanberg and Pran are arrested when they try to photograph the execution of two Khmer Rouge operatives by Cambodian army officers. They are eventually released and Schanberg is furious when the international press corps arrives with the U.S. Army to report a sanitized version of the story.The story moves ahead two years, to April 1975.

Pran's family is evacuated with the other international diplomats.On April 17, the Khmer Rouge move into the capital, seemingly under a banner of peace. During a parade through the city, Schanberg, suspicious of the positive way the Khmer Rouge are being welcomed, meets Rockoff, who tells him that he'd just come from an area where heavy fighting was taking place. At a makeshift hospital they see the result of the fighting; many children and other citizens are injured by shrapnel and gunfire. As they leave the hospital they are met by a small unit of Khmer Rouge troops, who arrest them immediately. Pran is at first not allowed into the armored personnel carrier with Schanberg, Rockoff, Swain and their driver, but he is able to bribe the Khmer Rouge officer with his wristwatch. The group is taken through the city to a hidden courtyard where prisoners are being held and executed. Pran, unharmed because he is a Cambodian civilian, negotiates with the Khmer Rouge officer in command for several hours to spare the lives of his friends. They are set free, joining the thousands of refugees fleeing the capital. Schanberg, Rockoff, Swain and Pran do not leave Phnom Penh, but they all instead retreat to the French embassy and stay there for several days, awaiting their chance to evacuate.During this time they are informed that the Khmer Rouge have demanded that all Cambodian citizens in the embassy be turned over. Fearing the embassy will be overrun, the embassy occupants comply. Knowing that Pran will be imprisoned or killed, Rockoff and fellow photographer Swain vainly try to forge a passport identifying Pran as a German citizen. Without a current picture of Pran, they use supplies they find in the embassy buildings; however, the picture fades because of the poor quality and age of the paper and chemicals they use. With no other options available, Pran is turned over to the Khmer Rouge to live under their totalitarian regime. All of the foreigners whom include the French, American, and most others are then expelled from Cambodia.Several months later, Schanberg returns to New York City where he is in the midst of a personal campaign to locate Pran. He has appealed to many humanitarian organizations and has kept in close contact with Pran's family in San Francisco.In Cambodia, Pran has become a forced laborer under the Khmer Rouge's ""Year Zero"" policy, a return to the agrarian ways of the past. Pran labors in rice fields under the watchful eyes of armed young Khmer Rouge children of both sexes, whom the Khmer Rouge hold in high regard as the future leaders of their regime. Pran is also forced to attend propagandist classes where everyone undergoes re-education. As intellectuals are singled out and murdered or made to disappear, Pran feigns simple-mindedness. Eventually, he tries to escape from his work camp, but is recaptured. Before he is found by members of the Khmer Rouge, he stumbles upon the infamous ""killing fields"" of the Pol Pot regime; endless acres of human bones and blue plastic bags (used for suffocation executions) where millions of Cambodian citizens were murdered by the new order.Flashing forward four years later to January 1979, Sydney Schanberg receives a journalism award for his coverage of the Cambodian conflict. At the acceptance dinner he tells the audience that half the recognition for the award belongs to Pran. In the men's room, he is confronted by Rockoff who harshly accuses him of not doing enough to locate Pran and for using his friend to win the award. Schanberg defends his efforts, saying that he has contacted every humanitarian relief agency possible in the four years since Pran's disappearance. Rockoff suggests that Schanberg subtly pressured Pran to remain in Cambodia because Pran was so vital to Sydney's work. This accusation hits close to home, and Schanberg begins to wonder whether he put his own self-interest ahead of Pran's safety. He finally admits that Pran ""stayed because I wanted him to stay.""Back in Cambodia, Pran is assigned to be the assistant to the Khmer Rouge leader of a different prison compound, a man named Phat, and charged mostly with tending to his little boy. Pran continues his self-imposed discipline of behaving as an uneducated peasant who merely drove a taxi, despite several of Phat's attempts to trick him into revealing his knowledge of both French and English. One night Pran listens to a radio broadcast in English and is discovered by Phat, who surprisingly doesn't punish him but seems to find a new trust in him. Phat asks Pran to take ward of his son in the event that he is killed.By this time, the Khmer Rouge are now engaged in a war with Vietnam. The conflict reaches Pran's region and a battle ensues between the Khmer Rouge of the compound and the invading Vietnamese troops which are supported when two Vietnamese fighter jets are sent in to destroy the camp. After the skirmish has ended, Pran discovers that Phat's son has American money and a map leading to safety. When Phat tries to stop the younger Khmer Rouge officers from killing several of his comrades, he is ignominiously shot.In the confusion, Pran escapes with four other prisoners and they begin a long trek through the jungle with Phat's young son. The group later splits and three of them head in a different direction. Pran continues following the map with one of them. However, Pran's companion steps on a hidden land mine while holding the child. Though Pran pleads with the man to give him the child, the mine goes off, killing them both. Pran mourns for a time and continues on, alone.One day, Pran crests the escarpment of the Dângrêk Mountains and sees a Red Cross camp near the border of Thailand. The scene shifts to Schanberg at the offices of the New York Times calling Pran's family with the news that Pran is alive and safe. Soon after, Schanberg travels to the Red Cross camp in Thailand and is reunited with Pran. Asking Pran to forgive him, Pran answers, with a smile, ""Nothing to forgive, Sydney"", as the two embrace.John Lennon's popular song, ""Imagine"" plays over the scene and during the end credits, which show actual photos of the real Pran and Schanberg."

The wandering barbarian, Conan, alongside his goofy rogue pal, Malak, are tasked with escorting Queen Taramis' virgin niece, Princess Jehnna and her bodyguard, Bombaata, to a mystical island fortress. They must retrieve a magical crystal that will help them procure the horn that legends say can awaken the god of dreams, Dagoth.

However, treason threatens not only the mission but also their very lives, as the amphibious oceanic deity can plunge the entire world into chaos and darkness, once it awakens. In a cruel, barbaric world, can Conan defeat terrible mortal and supernatural adversaries to save humankind?—Nick Riganas While praying at an altar with his traveling companion and fellow thief Malak (Tracey Walter), Conan (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is confronted by Queen Taramis (Sarah Douglas) of Shadazar, who tests the pair in combat with several of her guards attempting to capture him. She tells him that she has a quest for him, which he initially refuses. The queen uses her power to learn his greatest desire, to resurrect his beloved Valeria, and promises to bring her back to him, to which Conan agrees to the quest. They learn that the queen's niece, Jehnna (Olivia d'Abo) has been destined, due to a special birthmark, to find a special jewel that only she can touch and with it obtain the jewelled horn of the dreaming god, Dagoth. She tasks Conan and Malak to protect her on this journey, while her captain of the guard, Bombaata (Wilt Chamberlain), is secretly asked to betray and kill Conan once the task is complete so they can sacrifice Jehnna to the god without interruption.Due to the task of confronting a powerful wizard for the gem, Conan seeks the help of his friend, another wizard named Akiro (Mako) whom he saved from a tribe of cannibals that were about to eat him to absorb his magic power. Enroute they also meet Zula (Grace Jones), a powerful warrior and a bandit whom Jehnna and Conan save from being tortured by a group of villagers she and other bandits tried to raid, she joins the quest indebted to Conan for saving her life.

They confront Bombaata and Conan beats him in combat, killing him. Meanwhile, Jehnna is prepared to be sacrificed and the horn is placed upon the head of the Dagoth statue.

Queen Taramis is killed and Conan battles the Dagoth, eventually killing it by removing the horn from its head.After the battle, the newly crowned queen Jehnna offers each of her companions a place in her new court. Zula becomes the new captain of the guard, because Jehnna does not see any reason why a woman can't do as good a job as any man. Akiro becomes her new wiseman and advisor, and Malak steps forward and nearly trips, qualifying him for the position of court fool. She offers Conan her hand and the opportunity to rule the kingdom together, which he declines; having been promised a kingdom already, and departs on his own for further adventures and to find his own place in the world."
Dune,1984,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087182/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A Duke's son leads desert warriors against the galactic emperor and his father's evil nemesis to free their desert world from the emperor's rule. In the distant year of 10191, all the planets of the known Universe are under the control of Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV and the most important commodity in the Universe is a substance called the spice ""MELANGE"" which is said to have the power of extending life, expanding the consciousness and even to ""fold space"" ; being able to travel to any distance without physically moving. This spice ""MELANGE"" is said to only be produced in the desert planet of Arrakis, where the FREMEN people have the prophecy of a man who will lead them to true freedom. This ""desert planet""of Arrakis is also known as DUNE. A secret report of the space ""GUILD"" talks about some circumstances and plans that could jeopardize the production of ""SPICE"" with four planets involved: ARRAKIS, CALADAN, GIEDI PRIME and KAITAIN, a world at least visually very alike to Earth and house of the Emperor of the known Universe. The ""GUILD"" sends a third stage navigator to KAITAIN to ask details from the Emperor and to demand him the killing of young Paul Atreides, son of the Duke Leto Atreides of CALADAN.—David del Real ---@DavidRealActor---- With the extraordinary property of folding the time-space continuum and even expanding consciousness, the rare substance called melange, or ""spice"", is the most valuable commodity in the known universe. In the year 10,191, Atreides and Harkonnen, two warring clans under the thumb of conspiring Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV, fight for control. However, the coveted material exists only in the arid landscapes of the inhospitable, worm-infested desert planet, Arrakis or Dune. Now, against the backdrop of a sinister conspiracy and the murder of a beloved one, a gifted leader emerges, destined to command millions: the young son of Duke Leto Atreides, Paul. But can the inexperienced visionary harness the power of the mysterious dry moon and fulfil his destiny?—Nick Riganas The desert planet Arrakis - we enter the year 10191 and the whole universe depends on the spice Melange which exists only on this dry and desolate planet. The natives of this planet await the arrival of their Messiah who will lead them into a holy war against the evil Harkonnen empire. This is the film adaptation based on Frank Herbert's cult novel.—Harald Mayr <marvin@bike.augusta.de> In the opening monologue, Princess Irulan (Virginia Madsen) explains that after the fall of the machine titans and the reclaiming of the universe by humans, the people established training programs to gain knowledge they had lost in their apathy. The two training regimens, each gender specific, enabled humans to establish knowledge in math and psychic abilities. The universe is dominated politically and economically by the rarefied spice melange, which extends life and enhances certain psychic powers. The Galactic Spacing Guild and its prescient alien navigators use the spice to ""fold space"" and safely guide interstellar ships to any part of the universe instantaneously. Melange can be obtained in only one place: the desert planet of Arrakis, also known as Dune. The inhabitants of Dune, a nomadic people called the Fremen, have a legend that tells of the coming of a messiah from another world.The year is 10,191. The Guild sends a navigator emissary to the planet Kaitain to discuss a threat to spice production with the emperor of the known universe, Shaddam IV (José Ferrer). The emperor confidentially shares his plans to destroy one of the noble houses, the Atreides. The popularity of Duke Leto Atreides (Jürgen Prochnow) has grown, and he is suspected of amassing a secret army wielding sonic weapons called weirding modules, making him a threat to the emperor. Shaddam's plan is to give the Atreides control of the planet Arrakis to mine the spice, then have them ambushed by their longtime enemies, the Harkonnens, who have ruled Arrakis and the Fremen for centuries through cruelty and terror. The navigator commands the emperor to kill the duke's son, Paul Atreides (Kyle MacLachlan), a young man who dreams prophetic visions of his purpose. The order draws the attention of the Bene Gesserit sisterhood (a training institution for women), as Paul is a product of their centuries-long breeding program which seeks to produce the superhuman Kwisatz Haderach. Gaius Helen Mohiam (Siân Phillips), a Bene Gesserit reverend mother who serves as an adviser to the emperor, plans a visit to meet with Paul.On the planet Caladan, watery homeworld of House Atreides, Paul cannot understand why the Harkonnens would give up their hold on Arrakis to the Atreides, but understands that the family must go there. Thufir Hawat (Freddie Jones), a mentat (a human computer trained in pure mathematics), tells Paul they are going because of the promise of a new army. Paul's tutor and mentor, Gurney Halleck (Patrick Stewart), tests him in the limits of hand-to-hand fighting in preparation for his manhood trials and discusses Paul's amazing abilities with Thufir. Paul dons a weirding module and battles with a fighter robot, easily disarming it.Paul's mother, Lady Jessica (Francesca Annis), is also a member of the Bene Gesserit, and serves as Duke Leto's concubine. The reverend mother arrives on Caladan to test Paul. Jessica is worried that her son may not live through the test. Mohiam tells Paul about the Water of Life, bile from the giant Arrakis worms, which no man has ever drunk and survived. Only the Kwisatz Haderach, the true messiah in whom the Fremen inhabitants have prophesied will lead them out of oppression, can drink it. With a deadly gom jabbar at his throat, Paul is forced to place his hand in a box which subjects him to excruciating pain, but he resists the urge to withdraw his hand (which would result in death) and passes the test to Mohiam's satisfaction.Meanwhile, on Giedi Prime, the industrial homeworld of House Harkonnen, the physically sick, deformed, and sadistic Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (Kenneth McMillan) plans his personal revenge by finding a traitor within House Atreides who will kill the Duke. He assigns his nephews Glossu Rabban (Paul L. Smith) and Feyd-Rautha (Sting) the task of crushing House Atreides after they have assumed control of the planet.Upon arriving on Arrakis, Leto is informed by one of his right-hand men, Duncan Idaho (Richard Jordan), that the Fremen have been underestimated; they exist in vast numbers and could prove to be powerful allies. Paul and Leto meet with Dr. Kynes (Max von Sydow) a spice mining leader who takes them by aircraft to a remote area where they witness a giant worm attacking a spice mining ship, a ""crawler"". Faced with the destruction of the mining facilities, Duke Leto orders the giant crawler evacuated rather than risking lives by trying to save the precious spice ore, and even saves many of the workers by bringing them on his shuttle before the facility is destroyed, earning him the trust and recognition of Dr. Kynes and the rest of the Fremen workers. But before the Duke can establish an alliance with them, the Harkonnens launch their attack on Arrakis and House Atreides.While the Atreides had anticipated a trap, they are unable to withstand the Harkonnen attack, which is aided by the Emperor's elite troops, the much-feared Sardaukar, and by the Baron's traitor within House Atreides itself, Dr. Wellington Yueh (Dean Stockwell). Yueh plans revenge on Baron Harkonnen for the death of his wife. Captured, Leto dies in a failed attempt to assassinate the Baron using a poison gas capsule planted in his tooth by Dr. Yueh; with his vision fogged by drugs, Leto kills the baron's aide Piter De Vries (Brad Dourif) instead. With Piter dead, Captain Iakin Nefud (Jack Nance), the baron's head of security, takes over Piter's duties as the baron's valet and aide. Dr. Kynes is captured and abandoned in the desert to die. Thufir is forced to take over as director of spice mining for the Harkonnens, while Rabban becomes de facto governor of Arrakis.Paul and Jessica, who is pregnant by Duke Leto, escape into the deep desert, where they manage to join a band of Fremen led by Stilgar (Everett McGill). Paul adopts the title of Muad'Dib, and the Fremen suspect he is the leader they have been waiting for. Paul teaches the Fremen (who are formidable warriors) a new form of combat using the weirding modules and begins targeting mining production of spice to stop its flow. Stilgar trains Paul in Fremen traditions, and Paul rides his first sandworm. The Fremen's Bene Gesserit reverend mother has aged and Jessica drinks the Water of Life to replace her. The poisonous water causes her to go into convulsions and premature labor, her eyes bleed, and the transmutation of the sacred water awakens her knowledge. Jessica's daughter Alia (Alicia Witt) is born prematurely, but has blue-tinted eyes because of the spice and the knowledge imparted by the Water of Life. Within two years she grows rapidly into a young girl with great powers.During the war against the Spacing Guild, the Fremen, with Paul as their leader, effectively halt spice production on Arrakis. The Guild warns the emperor that he must intervene; they fear Paul will take the Water of Life. During a skirmish, Paul meets his former mentor Gurney Halleck, now a smuggler, who surrenders and immediately joins Paul and the Fremen to continue the war and maintain the strangle-hold on spice production. Paul begins a romance with Chani (Sean Young), the daughter of the leader Dr. Kynes (known to the Fremen as Liet). After a vision, Paul can no longer see his future and decides to drink the Water of Life.Paul goes into the desert with Chani and a cadre of bodyguards, drinks the Water of Life, and enters a coma-like state. Awakening literally and figuratively, he is transformed and gains control of the sandworms of Arrakis and the secret of the planet: water kept hidden in huge caches by the Fremen can be used to permanently destroy the spice. Paul also possesses the ability to see the future and, more importantly, the present when he gazes into space and sees the Emperor's plan; a huge invasion fleet above Arrakis has been amassed to regain control of the planet and the spice. Paul announces to his Fremen army that an enormous sandstorm is coming and will provide the perfect opportunity to take back their planet.When the emperor arrives on Arrakis, he executes the incompetent Rabban for failing to remedy the spice situation. The Baron arrives and is shocked at seeing the severed head of his nephew at the Emperor's feet. Before he can explain the situation, Alia is brought in as a hostage, and she delivers a message: Paul is coming for them. Paul launches a final attack against the Harkonnens and the emperor at the capital city of Arrakeen, using atomics to blast out a wide section of the shield wall protecting the city from the ravages of the desert. Paul leads the raid, riding through the breech with the Fremen on sandworms. After a climactic and fierce battle, where casualties are heavy on both sides, Paul and the Fremen warriors defeat the emperor's legions of Sardaukar, while Alia slashes the Baron with her gom jabbar and sends him into the maw of a sandworm.Afterward, Paul, Stilgar, Gurney, Alia, Jessica, and their army confront the captive emperor, Princess Irulan, and their staff. Paul is challenged to a duel with daggers by the psychotic Feyd. After a short but brutal fight, Paul stabs Feyd through his neck and uses his vocal powers to explode his internal organs. Paul faces the defeated emperor, relieves him of power, and announces an era of peace for all of humanity. Storm clouds gather and it begins raining on Arrakis for the first time in the planet's existence. Alia declares, ""And how can this be? For he is the Kwisatz Haderach!"""

Alex gets as far as the Starfighter base before he really realized that he was conscripted and requests to be taken back home. When he gets back home, he finds a Zando-Zan (alien bounty hunter) is stalking him. Unable to go home and live, Alex returns to the Starfighter base to find all the pilots have been killed and he is the galaxy's only chance to be saved from invasion. To defeat the invaders, who are paying the bounty on him, he must be victorious.—John Vogel <jvogel@dgs.dgsys.com> & Spokavriel updated Alex Rogan lives in a trailer park with his mother Jane Rogan and his younger brother Louis. Alex is a handyman that helps his neighbors in small tasks. He is waiting for a loan so that he can attend university and move with his girlfriend Maggie Gordon to the city. However, Alex receives a letter informing that his request of a student loan has been denied. When Alex breaks the record of the Starfighter video game, he is visited by a man named Centauri that informs him that he works in the company that manufactures the game and invites him to a ride in his sports car. Alex soon learns that Centauri's car is a spacecraft and the Starfighter game is actually a test to find skilled warriors to protect the Star League against Xur and the Ko-Dan Armada. Alex arrives on the planet Rylos but he refuses the invitation. Alex returns to his home and finds that he is hunted by alien agents sent by Xur to kill him. He summons Centauri and learns that all the starfighters have been killed in a treacherous attack on the Starfighter base. Alex and his partner Grig are now the last chance to avoid the invasion of the cruel warlord Xur.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Alex Rogan (Lance Guest), is a teenager living in a Southern California trailer park with his divorced mother (Barbara Bosson) and little 10-year-old brother Louis (Chris Hebert). Outside of being a handyman at the trailer park, his sole hobby is playing Starfighter, a stand-up arcade game where the player defends ""the Frontier"" from ""Xur and the Ko-Dan Armada"" in a space battle. Alex has high hopes that one day he can escape the trailer park and attend a prestigious college, however he gets a rejection letter from a college he had wished to attend.Eventually one evening, he becomes the highest scoring player of the game, winning the final round where he has to destroy the enemy squadron's command ship. His victory becomes quite a joyous event for most of the trailer park, with everyone, including his little brother Louis, cheering him on. Later that night, he is approached by the game's inventor, an eccentric old man who identifies himself as Centauri (Robert Preston) who invites him to take a ride in an exotic-looking sports car. Alex does so before discovering that the vehicle is actually a spaceship; moreover, Centauri is a disguised alien who whisks him off to a faraway planet called Rylos, leaving behind his family and girlfriend, Maggie Gordon (Catherine Mary Stewart). So that his absence goes unnoticed, an android lookalike named Beta (Lance Guest in a dual role) is left in his place.Upon his arrival, Alex discovers that the images and territories in the Starfighter arcade game represent an actual conflict between the Rylan Star League and the Ko-Dan Empire, an alien lizard-like race which is assisted by Xur (Norman Snow), a native traitor to whom the Ko-Dan Emperor has promised control of Rylos itself. The game was designed by Centauri as a test to find those with the gift; Alex is expected to pilot an actual Starfighter spacecraft called the Gunstar. He also discovers that the Frontier is an array of planetary-scale force fields that protect Rylos and its surrounding planets from invasion from the hostile Ko-Dan on the other side, and that Xur has given the Ko-Dan Armada the technology and means to breach it.Before Alex can fully understand and dispute his induction, Xur appears in a holographic projection and reveals he has discovered an infiltrator in his ranks and proceeds to broadcast his death by torture to the entire base, including his estranged father, Ambassador Enduran (Kay E. Kuter), the Starfighter commander. He then proclaims to the people of Rylos that once Galan (the Rylan moon) is in full eclipse, the Ko-Dan Armada will begin their invasion and not even the starfighters will be able to save them. While receiving payment for bringing Alex to Rylos as a recruit, it's discovered that Centauri had used an illegal method to do so, bringing Alex in against his wishes from a planet beyond their federation. Unnerved by everything he has seen, Alex asks to be taken back home. Centauri does so and is highly disappointed, and brushes off Alex's protests that he is nothing special, noting that attitude will prevent him from becoming more. After dropping him off a short distance away from the trailer park, Centauri gives Alex a communications device, which is a means by which to contact him, should Alex change his mind.After they leave Rylos, the Starfighter base is attacked. A small breach in the Frontier is achieved and the Ko-Dan command ship fires large missile-like meteors at the Starfighter base. During the attack, a saboteur eliminates the base's defenses. The base sustains heavy damage, killing all Starfighters save for a friendly reptilian alien navigator named Grig (Dan O'Herlihy), and destroying all the Gunstars save for an advanced prototype. Afterward, Xur becomes enraged when he learns that one Starfighter has escaped the base.Once home on Earth, Alex discovers the android who assumed his identity and contacts Centauri to come and retrieve it. Just then, a beast-like assassin appears and attempts to shoot Alex with a laser gun. Centauri arrives and shoots the creature. Centauri identifies the assassin as a Xando-Xan, an ""interstellar hitbeast"" sent by Xur, with more surely coming to kill Alex themselves. Alex finally realizes that the only way to protect himself is to return to Rylos and pilot a Gunstar, while Beta keeps the hitbeats' attention. The Xando-Xan is able to manipulate his severed arm and shoots at Alex, hitting Centauri. They leave Beta behind, returning to Rylos. When they arrive, they find that the base has been destroyed. Centauri allegedly dies from his wound, and Alex meets up once again with Grig and they set out in the Gunstar to battle the Ko-Dan Armada by themselves. Alex is given a brief update on the Gunstar, which is more advanced than the ships that were destroyed; it is able to take laser blasts with minimal damage and houses a new weapon called the Death Blossom. After a brief chase near the Frontier with a small scout ship sent by Xur that Alex destroys, the experience leaves Alex somewhat rattled. Grig believes that Alex isn't ready for combat and agrees to take him home where he should live a long life, until the Ko-Dan likely one day attempt to conquer Earth. Realizing the stakes and what he is fighting for, Alex thinks of a strategy to fight the armada; he agrees to stay and fight.Meanwhile back on Earth, the Beta-Alex tries to adjust to life at the trailer park and dealing with human interaction, especially with Maggie. During an evening out at a lake with some of Alex's friends, another assassin arrives in the form of a policeman that it recently killed, and attempts to shoot Alex as he sits around a campfire at a resort lake. When Maggie becomes annoyed by Beta's awkward attempts at romantic conversation, he finally gives up and admits that he is not Alex, but an android Beta unit. The assassin fires his laser gun at Beta, revealing green android fluid which comes out of the wound. The assassin flees in the stolen police car while Beta, with Maggie tagging along, chases the assassin in a pickup truck Beta steals. When the assassin arrives back at his spaceship, he attempts to radio the Ko-Dan Armada to report that the last starfighter is actually about to attack them. Beta forces Maggie to jump from the truck as he rams the truck into the assassin's spaceship, destroying her and himself. The transmission to the Ko-Dan Armada is cut off. On the Ko-Dan command ship, Xur receives the assassin's message, which is cut off; ""The last starfighter is--"" Xur mistakenly assumes that the last word is ""dead"" and orders the attack on Rylos.With the Frontier down, Xur sends the armada through the breach. Alex and Grig employ Alex's strategy and hide in a small asteroid near the Frontier and attack the Ko-Dan command ship from behind. The approaching GunStar is detected and Lord Kril (Dan Mason), the commander of the Ko-Dan command ship, blames Xur for this complication because of his mistaken assumption and orders him seized and removed from the Bridge. However, that means little as Alex and Gig cripple the Command Ship's communications system and impairs the Ko-Dan fighter wings' fighting ability. The climatic space battle reaches a fevered pitch; Alex keeps the upper hand, using the ""lone fighter-against-hordes"" tactics he mastered by playing the coin-operated video game. However, his weapons are soon depleted. Desperately, Grig has Alex activate the Death Blossom, which destroys all the remaining Ko-Dan fighters After relieving Xur of command, Kril orders him executed for his arrogance and failure to ensure victory. Instead, Xur takes advantage of Alex's attack and kills the sentries escorting him from the bridge. He then escapes from the command ship in an escape pod.Lord Kril then orders the command ship at ramming speed towards the lone Gunstar which has been temporarily drained of power by the use of the Death Blossom. Grig manages to tap into the Gunstar's life support systems to temporarily regain power, which Alex fires and disables the command ship's systems, forcing her to crash into the moon of Galan. The command ship is destroyed, killing Kril and all of the remaining Ko-Dan warriors on board. Alex is proclaimed the savior of Rylos, only to discover from Enduran (who escaped from the Starfighter base before its destruction) that the Star League is still vulnerable: the Frontier has collapsed and Xur escaped, and he will continue to be a threat as long as he still lives. Alex agrees to stay on Rylos for good and recruit other starfighters, rebuilding the Legion. Alex is also happy and revealed to see that Centauri is alive having healed from his wounds.Alex returns to Earth, dramatically landing his Gunstar in the trailer park. Grig informs Alex's mother and the people of the trailer park of Alex's heroism in the Rylan Star League and that he will be a starfighter of great potential, who will teach future starfighters. He also explains that Alex's actions will one day protect Earth from the Ko-Dan Empire as well. After explaining to his friends and family where he was, Alex reveals that his services as a starfighter are still needed by the Rylan Star League and that he may not return for a while. He then asks Maggie to join him in space. Maggie's grandmother, Granny Gordon (Meg Wyllie) gives her blessing to her granddaughter, and Maggie returns to Rylos with him. After Alex's Gunstar takes off back to Rylos, Louis is inspired to follow in his brother's footsteps and begins playing the game, so that he can also master it someday."
Starman,1984,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088172/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"An alien takes the form of a young Wisconsin widow's husband and makes her drive him to his departure point in Arizona. Distrustful government agents, along with a more ambivalent scientist, give pursuit in hopes of intercepting them. Jenny Hayden never did get over the death of her husband, so when an alien life form decides to model ""himself"" on the husband, Jenny is understandably confused if not terrified. The alien, or Starman, as he is called, has a deadline to meet and kidnaps Jenny in order to meet it.—Rob Hartill Having accepted an invitation to visit Earth (sent in the one of the Voyager space probes in the 1970s) an alien receives a rude reception when his ship is fired upon and disabled. He has only three days to get to the giant crater near Winslow, AZ where he will be rescued or else he will die. Taking human form, he seeks the assistance of the recently widowed Jenny Hayden. Initially terrified, she comes to care for the alien visitor. All the while, government agents seek to track them down.—garykmcd In 1977, the Voyager 2 travels to the outer space with messages of peace and greetings from Earth. A small alien spacecraft comes to Earth to make contact with Earthlings, but the military airplanes shoot it down. The spacecraft crashes in Chequamegon Bay, WI, and the alien wanders in a form of energy to the house of the young widow Jenny Hayden, where he uses the DNA from a hair of her husband Scott to take his human form. The Starman contacts his mother ship, and he needs to be in a crater Arizona in a couple of days to return to his star; otherwise, he will be left behind and will die. The Starman forces Jenny to take him to Arizona, and she is hostile with him in the beginning. However, she learns that he is a peaceful being, and she chooses to help him. However, the army is chasing them, and the despicable NSA chief George Fox wants to hunt him down. On the other hand, SETI scientist Mark Shermin wants to help The Starman as he is sure the alien has come to visit Earth peacefully.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil An alien who has crash-landed in the United States takes on the the appearance of a woman's dead husband and enlists her help to escape from pursuing authorities and rendezvous with a spacecraft on the other side of the country. As he learns how to be more human the alien begins to take on more and more qualities of the woman's husband, drawing the woman closer.—Keith Loh <loh@sfu.ca> In 1977, the Voyager 2 deep space probe was launched containing a gold, phonographic disk with messages of peace embedded within it and inviting visitors to come to the planet Earth. The Voyager probe is intercepted by an alien space ship which sends a small observational scout vessel in response to the invitation in order to establish first contact with Earth. However, instead of being greeted by its human hosts, the spacecraft is promptly shot down by the US government. The ship crashes in Chequamegon Bay, Wisconsin and the alien, a blue ball of energy, emerges from the wreckage. It stumbles upon the house of recently widowed Jenny Hayden (Karen Allen). There, it finds a lock of hair belonging to Jenny's deceased husband Scott in a photo album and uses it to clone a new body. The depressed Jenny watches stunned as the alien takes on Scott's form.The Starman (Jeff Bridges) possesses seven small silver spheres which he turns into pure energy to perform miraculous feats. He uses the first one to send a message to his people that his craft has been destroyed, that the environment is hostile, and that he will rendezvous with them at ""Landing Area One"" in three days, located in Arizona. He then uses the second one to create a holographic map of the United States in order to compel the dumbstruck Jenny to help him get to Arizona. However, Jenny is frightened of the Starman and reacts with hostility towards him, doing what she can to avoid traveling with him. After repeatedly and unsuccessfully attempting to escape, she finally implores the Starman to shoot her with her pistol. Instead, the Starman releases the pistol's magazine and tells her he means her no harm. As they continue on their journey the Starman, who developed a rough understanding of English syntax from the Voyager 2 disk, learns to communicate exactly who he is and what his purpose is to Jenny while she tries to teach the Starman that humanity is not completely savage.The Starman explains to Jenny that he has three days to get to the rendezvous point, Arizona's Barringer Crater, or he will die. She teaches him how to drive a car and use credit cards, intending to leave him self sufficient enough to continue the journey alone. However, while they are stopped at a small diner, they connect on a more emotional level with Jenny attempting to explain to him what love is. She also witnesses the Starman revive a dead deer that had been tied to the front of a hunter's (Ted White) car. Deeply moved, she resolves to help him.Meanwhile, the US army, after discovering the crash site of the Starman's ship, is tracking the couple's trail to Arizona. The army battalion is led by the cold-blooded NSA Chief George Fox (Richard Jaeckel) who is reluctantly assisted by SETI scientist, Mark Shermin (Charles Martin Smith). Shermin is clearly a more understanding and empathic man and, after he finds the Voyager 2 disk in the Starman's ship, Shermin deduces that the Starman was invited to Earth peacefully and discovers that the alien has taken the form of Scott Hayden through collected pieces of evidence around Jenny's house.Once news of the fugitives becomes publicized, a couple of cops (Dirk Blocker,M.C. Gainey) intent on becoming local heroes, discover Jenny and Starman residing at a motel. They decide to hold position outside until the government arrives but, when Jenny and Starman attempt to escape, despite employing a distraction, the cops pursue them by car and one shoots Jenny. Starman crashes their vehicle into an overturned gas tanker, protecting himself and Jenny from the ensuing explosion with one of his spheres. Under cover of the chaos, he seeks refuge in a mobile home being transported on a trailer bed.Jenny never regains consciousness but Starman, down to his last two spheres, uses one to revive her, gently kissing her as her wounds heal. He then leaves her and attempts to reach the Crater alone; afraid she will be hurt again. Jenny regains consciousness and heads off to find him, aware that they were being pursued by the government. Meanwhile, the Starman hitches a ride with a local truck driver, telling him that his name is Scott and he's headed for Arizona. A large traffic jam awaits them. Several miles back, Jenny manages to hitch a ride with another truck diver and, after a while, are met by the same traffic jam. Police have barricaded the road and are interrogating people. When she locates Starman standing anonymously within the crowd, and knowing it's only a matter of time before he's revealed, Jenny employs the truck driver to stage a distraction for her. He explodes a gas can which incites the police to chase after him, enabling Jenny to reach Starman. They escape in the panic and continue their journey, stowing away on a train boxcar.En route, they become close and consummate their feelings for one another. Starman tells Jenny that he gave her a baby, despite Jenny's insistence that she is infertile. Starman assures her to believe what he says and tells her that the child will be the son of her husband, since he is a clone of Scott. He explains that the child will know all that Starman knows and will grow up to be a teacher. However, he gives her the option of taking it back but Jenny refuses, joyfully accepting his gift.The couple mistakenly travel too far on the train and arrive in Las Vegas and, to make matters worse, Jenny has lost her wallet. The Starman uses their last quarters in a slot machine which he manipulates with his powers in order to win a $50,000 jackpot. The couple use their winnings to buy a new car to complete the drive to Winslow, Arizona, which is near Barringer Crater.Meanwhile, Fox has received information from NORAD that the trajectory of The Starman's Observation Craft, prior to it being shot down, was to Barringer Crater, and concludes that the Starman, along with Jenny Hayden would be in that general vicinity within the next 24 hours of that determination.Near the end of the journey, the Starman, growing weaker, and Jenny are confronted in a cafe in Winslow, where Mark Shermin interviews the dying Starman. The Starman explains to him that his people had previously visited Earth and are interested in humans because, out of all the many savage intelligent races in the universe, humans are at their best when things are at their worst. Confronted with this, Shermin decides to ruin his career to help the Starman and Jenny escape.The couple reach the crater as Army helicopters buzz them. Suddenly, the aliens' large, spherical mothership appears in the sky and descends into the crater. A blue light surrounds the couple and the Starman is instantly restored to health. He tells Jenny he will never see her again. Jenny confesses her love and begs him to take her with him but he says she would die on his world. He then gives her his last silver sphere, telling her that her son will know what to do with it before asking Jenny to tell her son about him. He asks her to tell him how to say goodbye and they kiss one last time before the Starman walks away into the beam. As Jenny watches in silence, the mothership rises, carrying the Starman away."

Teachers,1984,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088242/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A well meaning but burned-out high school teacher tries to maintain order against the backdrop of a pending lawsuit against his school district when it comes to light they gave a diploma to an illiterate student. A teacher overcomes his frustration in a high-school full of flunkies. As he attempts to educate his students, his attempts to help them gets him into trouble with the school board, which only adds to his problems. With the support of his students he beats the school board and his frustration.—K. Rose <rcs@texas.net> At John F. Kennedy High School in the inner city slums of Columbus, Ohio, Vice Principal Roger Rubell (Judd Hirsch) juggles several problems on a cold winter Monday morning, including a student with a stab wound, lack of substitute teachers, and a school psychologist who goes berserk. Moreover, attorney and Kennedy High alumna, Lisa Hammond (JoBeth Williams), arrives to give Rubell notice about depositions scheduled for tomorrow. Lisa represents a former student named John Calvin, who is suing the school for graduating him without being able to read or write. Infuriated about the psychologist incident and the Calvin case, school superintendent Dr. Donna Burke (Lee Grant) stops by to remind Rubell and Principal Eugene Horn (William Schallert) that the school cannot afford bad publicity, emphasizing that Kennedy High's financial security is dependent on public trust.As Dr. Burke reviews the files of teachers who will be participating in the depositions, Rubell assures her that Alex Jurel (Nick Nolte), a popular social studies teacher and a 15-year veteran of Kennedy High, will support the school, despite his past association with student rights issues. While the school psychologist is on temporary leave, Alex Jurel assumes some counseling duties and meets with rebellious student, Eddie Pilikian (Ralph Macchio), who is only reading at a sixth-grade level. Furthermore, Eddie's divorced parents appear more concerned with custody issues than their son's education. Although against school policy, Alex asks Eddie to attend his advanced social studies class, so he can encourage him.After work, Rubell and Alex go drinking at a local bar, and Alex mentions that he is weary of trying to teach in a dysfunctional system and is ready to quit.In the school hallway the next morning, Alex avoids an encounter with Lisa Hammond, who is also one of his former students, but she literally follows him into the men's restroom and serves him a subpoena for the deposition. She adds that she had a crush on him in high school and invites him to dinner.During the first deposition with Principal Horn, Lisa realizes the process is going to be difficult as Principal Horn dodges her questions. Meanwhile, Eddie intervenes in a fight to protect his dangerously disturbed, kleptomaniac and schizo friend Danny Reese (Crispin Glover) from bullies. Afterward the fearful Danny wonders whether he should get a gun to protect himself.During dinner, Lisa is curious about Alex's opinion on the Calvin case, but he is careful not to voice his position and only states that the lawsuit is about money, not education. After talking with another teacher, Alex realizes that no one was interested in taking the time to improve Eddie's reading skills and simply advanced him through the system.Meanwhile, Herbert Gower (Richard Mulligan), who was recently released from a mental institution, impersonates a substitute teacher named Stuart Van Ark and arrives at Kennedy High to teach a history class. The students are amused as he throws a book out the window, puts on an Abraham Lincoln costume, and recites the Gettysburg Address.In his social studies class, Alex is impressed with how Eddie uses photography to complete an assignment and hopes it is the beginning of a breakthrough with the street-smart teenager.At their next dinner date, Alex and Lisa kiss, but she appears more interested in discussing the Calvin case, which she hopes will change the school for the better. Alex is frustrated, and believes the lawsuit will only cause more damage to the high school's reputation. He indicates he will support the school in the deposition.Later, Kenneth 'Ditto' Stiles (Royal Dano), an elderly teacher who often falls asleep in class, quietly passes away at his desk from a heart attack, but none of his students notice. Eventually, Grace Wensel (Madeleine Sherwood), Principal Horn's secretary, is alerted and she calls an ambulance to take his body away.Meanwhile, Herbert continues to portray famous Americans and the students appear engaged as they help him act out historical events such as George Washington crossing the Delaware River.When student Diane Warren (Laura Dern) reveals to her friend Eddie that she had sex with the gym teacher Mr. Troy (Art Metrano) and is pregnant, he takes her to consult with Alex. Afraid of her parents knowing, she pleads with Alex Jurel to take her to an abortion clinic, and he reluctantly agrees.At his deposition, an exasperated teacher named Carl Rosenberg (Allen Garfield) is unwilling to lie for the school and claims that John Calvin rarely attended class, but received a passing grade ""because it is policy.""Meanwhile, Alex has finally convinced Eddie to take another reading class, but Rubell determines that the boy's reading skills are good enough. When Rubell reminds Alex they need to help hundreds of students through the system and cannot devote all their time to assisting one troubled teenager, Alex is concerned that they are repeating the mistake they made with John Calvin.After Rosenberg's deposition, school attorney Alan Lewis (Morgan Freeman) warns Rubell that if Alex Jurel confirms Rosenberg's statement, the school will lose the case. Rubell no longer trusts Alex and advises Dr. Burke to oust the teacher from the school.During a police search for drugs, the troubled Danny panics and removes a gun from his locker. However, an officer mistakenly believes Danny is about to aim the weapon, and fatally shoots the boy. When Eddie finds out his friend is dead, he tells Alex he is quitting school and walks out the classroom.Meanwhile, Herbert Gower's actual identity is finally revealed when authorities from the mental health institution arrive at the school to escort him away while he is dressed up as General George Custer for his class. His students are disappointed, and Alex salutes the departing Herbert for being a passionate teacher.At her downtown law office, Lisa learns that her firm has reached a settlement in the Calvin case and is disappointed that an opportunity has been lost to improve Kennedy High. Even though the case is settled out of court, Dr. Burke tells Rubell that she is worried Alex could cause trouble in the future and proceeds to force him out.Alex, meanwhile, is unaware of the settlement and arrives for his deposition. Instead, he is summoned before a school board and asked by Dr. Burke to sign resignation papers or face being fired. Although Alex is tenured, Dr. Burke has made a confidential deal with the teachers union to ensure they will not interfere in his dismissal. Dr. Burke questions Alex about taking Diane Warren for an abortion, which was performed without parental consent. As a member of the board, Rubell advises Alex to take the deal or risk accusations of sexual misconduct. Alex does not sign the papers, but walks to his classroom and begins packing, resigned to the fact that he can no longer make a difference. Lisa arrives and urges him to fight the school board, certain that they would never risk firing him over Diane's abortion because of the bad publicity it would generate. Alex becomes tearful as his students enter the classroom to support him. After Lisa makes one more desperate attempt to remind Alex about his ideals as a teacher by literally stripping off all her clothes in public, he declares to Rubell and Dr. Burke that he will not resign by quoting ""I'm a teacher!"" He also threatens a lawsuit if he is fired. He proudly walks back into the school to loud cheers from the students."
A Passage to India,1984,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087892/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Cultural mistrust and false accusations doom a friendship in British colonial India between an Indian doctor, an Englishwoman engaged to marry a city magistrate, and an English educator. It's the early 1920s. Britons Adela Quested (Judy Davis) and her probable future mother-in-law Mrs. Moore (Peggy Ashcroft) have just arrived in Chandrapore in British India to visit Adela's unofficial betrothed, Ronny Heaslop (Nigel Havers), who works there as the city's magistrate. Adela and Mrs. Moore, who long for ""an adventure"" in experiencing all India has to offer, are dismayed to learn upon their arrival that the ruling British do not socialize, let alone associate, with the native population. Such people as the Turtons, Mr. Turton (Richard Wilson) being Ronny's superior, who openly thumb their noses at the idea in their belief that the Indians are an inferior people. They are further dismayed to see that Ronny adheres to that custom in not wanting to jeopardize his career. At the local white only club, Adela and Mrs. Moore find a like-minded Brit in the form of Richard Fielding (James Fox), the school master at government college, he who offers to organize a small, but truly inclusive, social gathering with some natives for them, unlike the large party the Turtons organize, where the natives are treated poorly, and are used more as window dressing for Adela and Mrs. Moore's benefit. In addition to Fielding's colleague, eccentric Brahmin scholar Professor Narayan Godbole (Sir Alec Guinness), Adela, and Mrs. Moore would like to invite Aziz Ahmed (Victor Banerjee), a young, widowed local physician with whom Mrs. Moore had a chance encounter. As Mrs. Moore is the first Brit who has ever treated him with kindness as she did at that encounter, Aziz is happy to attend. As Aziz wants to impress them by being what he thinks they want him to be, which is more western, he offers to organize an outing for this small collective to the Marabar Caves, which has some renown. The outing is despite Aziz never having been to the caves himself, and despite the expense to himself, that sum of money which he really can ill afford. Something that happens at the caves has the potential to bring the British-Indian bridge that has been forged within this small collective come crumbling down, that something which also threatens Aziz and Adela's lives in the process.—Huggo Adela Quested (Judy Davis), a young Englishwoman, travels to India in the late 1920s to visit her fiancé, a British magistrate posted in a small town. Her travelling companion is his mother Mrs. Moore (Peggy Ashcroft). They want to see something of the country and to meet everyday Indians, but are frustrated by the British community's insistence that relations with the locals are best experienced from a distance. Finally, a friend introduces them to a Muslim doctor who Mrs. Moore had seen briefly on her visit to a mosque. He takes them on an outing to the nearby caverns (a local attraction), but what happens there threatens to destroy any civility between the British and Indian societies.—scgary66 The film is set in the 1920s during the period of growing influence of the Indian independence movement in the British Raj. Mrs. Moore (Peggy Ashcroft) and Adela Quested (Judy Davis) sail from England to India, where Ronny Heaslop (Nigel Havers), the older woman's son and younger woman's fiancé, is the local magistrate in the provincial town of Chandrapore. Through school superintendent Richard Fielding (James Fox), the two visitors meet eccentric elderly Brahmin scholar Professor Godbole (Alec Guinness), and they befriend Dr. Aziz Ahmed (Victor Banerjee), an impoverished widower who initially meets Mrs. Moore in a moonlit mosque overlooking the Ganges River. Their sensitivity and unprejudiced attitude toward native Indians endears them to him. When Mrs. Moore and Adela express an interest in seeing the ""real"" India, as opposed to the Anglicised environment of cricket, polo, and afternoon tea the British expatriates have created for themselves, Aziz offers to host an excursion to the remote Marabar Caves.The outing goes reasonably well until the two women begin exploring the caves with Aziz and his sizable entourage. Mrs. Moore experiences an overwhelming sense of claustrophobia that forces her to return to the open air. She encourages Adela and Aziz to continue their exploration but suggests they bring only one guide. The three set off for a series of caves far removed from the rest of the group, and before entering Aziz steps aside to smoke a cigarette. He returns to find Adela has disappeared; shortly after he sees her running headlong down the hill, bloody and dishevelled. Upon their return to town, Aziz is jailed to await trial for attempted rape, and an uproar ensues between the Indians and the Colonials.The case becomes a cause celebre among the British. When Mrs. Moore makes it clear she firmly believes in Aziz's innocence and will not testify against him, it is decided she should return to England. She subsequently suffers a fatal heart attack during the voyage and is buried at sea.To the consternation of her fiancé and friends, Adela has a change of heart and clears Aziz in open court. The Colonials are forced to make an ignominious retreat while the Indians carry the exonerated man out of the courtroom on their shoulders, cheering wildly. In the aftermath, Miss Quested breaks off her engagement and leaves India, while Dr. Aziz abandons his Western attire, dons traditional dress, and withdraws completely from Anglo-Indian society, opening a clinic in Northern India near the Himalayas. Although he remains angry and bitter for years, he eventually writes to Adela to convey his thanks and forgiveness."

The Cotton Club,1984,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087089/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Meet the jazz musicians, dancers, owner, and guests (like gangster Dutch Schultz) of The Cotton Club in 1928-1930s Harlem. The Cotton Club was a famous Harlem nightclub. This is the story of the people who visited this club as well as the people who ran it, and the film is generously peppered with the jazz music that made the Cotton Club so renowned in the 1920s and 1930s.—Colin Tinto <cst@imdb.com> with corrections by BSmith The parallel and occasionally intersecting stories of Sandman Williams and Michael ""Dixie"" Dwyer, starting in 1928; the intersections mainly happen at the Cotton Club, a Harlem jazz club where the performers, like Sandman who has a dance routine with his brother Clay, are exclusively black and the patrons, like Dixie--personal musician (jazz cornetist and pianist) to married gangster Dutch Schultz whom he often accompanies to the club--are exclusively white. Sandman's focus on advancing his and Clay's dance career together ends up taking a back seat and threatens their relationship altogether when Sandman meets and falls in love with club singer Lila Rose Oliver, a biracial woman with Broadway aspirations who can pass for either black or white depending on the situation but doesn't fit wholly into either world. Dixie fell into Dutch's employ by chance and finds getting out difficult; he can't stomach the senseless killing around--and often initiated by--Dutch. Dixie gets into a passionate relationship with singer Vera Cicero, Dutch's girl-on-the-side who, unlike Dixie, can stomach being with Dutch to achieve her goal of owning her own club. When the club's owner, Owney Madden--a gangster himself, with a heart of gold--offers Dixie a way out, Dixie tries to convince Vera that the life he can offer her is better than what she has with Dutch, and in the process keep from being hunted down by Dutch in what he would see as an act of betrayal.—Huggo"

A Nightmare on Elm Street,1984,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087800/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Teenager Nancy Thompson must uncover the dark truth concealed by her parents after she and her friends become targets of the spirit of a serial killer with a bladed glove in their dreams, in which if they die, it kills them in real life. On Elm Street, Nancy Thompson and a group of her friends (comprising Tina Gray, Rod Lane and Glen Lantz) are being tormented by a clawed killer in their dreams named Fred Krueger. Nancy must think quickly, as Fred tries to pick them off one by one. When he has you in your sleep, who is there to save you?—simon_hrdng Springwood County, Ohio. A deformed dream stalker has been tormenting high school student Nancy Thompson and the teenagers on Elm Street. But everyone knows nightmares are not real. The deep slashes on their bodies, however, say otherwise. And as innocents die left and right, ripped to pieces, the oneiric intruder's charred figure haunts Nancy, who must remain awake to stay alive. Now, bright-red blood and a long-forgotten, hair-raising connection to the small town blur the line between the victims' dreams and the ghastly murderer's realm. After all, the vengeful shadowy killer has all the time in the world to inflict pain. And sooner or later, the kids will fall asleep. Who can stand in hell's way and The Glove?—Nick Riganas Nancy and her friends suffer violent nightmares which all feature one common element, a disfigured serial killer with a glove made of razors on his right hand. When one of the group is murdered while asleep, Nancy realizes that she must stay awake and try to uncover the truth behind this phantasmic killer Fred Krueger.—Action Dan <actiondan@talk21.com> The film opens with a bizarre sequence where we see an unidentified individual, visible only by his hands, creating a strange weapon: a glove with sharp knives for fingers. Tina, a young girl in a nightgown, is rushing down ominous alleyways filled with steam and shadows. Suddenly the bizarre man lunges at her, brandishing the glove. Tina screams and sits bolt upright in her bed; the entire episode was a nightmare. Tina's mother comes into her bedroom, alerted by her scream, and notices that Tina's nightgown is slashed near her stomach. The cuts are similar to what would be made with the glove from the dream.Tina meets her friends at school the next morning: her boyfriend Rod, her best friend Nancy, and Nancy's boyfriend, Glen. Nancy and Tina discover that they have both had the same nightmare, and although Glen and Rod try and hide the fact, they seem to have been having nightmares, too. That night, Nancy and Glen decide to stay with Tina, because her mother has gone out of town. Rod shows up later and frightens the three of them by making strange sounds in the back yard and then jumping out at Glen. Rod and Tina go upstairs into a bedroom to have sex, while Nancy and Glen sleep separately downstairs; Nancy resists the idea of fooling around, since she and Glen are supposedly there as moral support for Tina.As all of them fall asleep, strange things begin to occur. The wall over Nancy's bed seems to lose its solid form, and the shape of a human figure looking at her seems to lean out of it. Nancy does not see it, her eyes closed in half-sleep, and when she awakens, the form disappears. In the room where Tina and Rod are sleeping, Tina is awakened by noises at the window; someone is in the back yard hurling small rocks at the glass. Tina knows this is whoever has been trying to frighten her, and she goes downstairs to confront whoever it is. When she ventures out into the back yard, a phantom voice lures her into the alley, the same as in her dream. She is startled by strange things such as a goat suddenly lurching into the alley, and then finally her stalker emerges, a man in a fedora, a dirty red and green striped sweater, and the deadly glove with knives for fingers. He taunts Tina by laughing at her and whispering her name, and he walks towards her with his arms stretching further than humanly possible, spanning the entire alley, blocking her escape. Tina retreats into her back yard and the figure leaps out again, this time from behind a tree. He slices off his own fingers and strangely colored blood spurts out. Tina tries to make it into her back door, but the man grabs her, and she struggles with him. We see Tina in bed next to Rod, trashing around; she has been dreaming this incident, as well, only the man seems to actually be under the covers with her. Rod awakens and pulls off the sheet. He can only see Tina, but she is being manipulated by some unseen force. Her stomach is slashed open, four wounds appearing all at the same time, obviously from the glove. Tina is dragged screaming up the wall, over the ceiling, and falls down dead into the bed, which is now covered in her blood. Nancy and Glen have now awakened and burst into the room to find Rod gone, apparently through the window. Tina is dead.At the police station, Nancy is giving her account of what happened and she talks to Lt. Donald Thompson, who also happens to be her father. Nancy's mother, Marge, and Lt. Thompson are apparently divorced, and they greet each other with restrained hostility. Rod is the obvious suspect in the murder, but Nancy feels that this is not the case; although Rod has a reputation as a delinquent, Nancy knows he is not a killer.As Nancy walks to school the next morning, Rod appears and pulls her into some bushes. Rod swears to Nancy that he did not kill Tina, but before they can talk any further, Lt. Thompson appears with his men and arrests Rod. Nancy is offended that her father used her to capture Rod, and she storms off.At school, the exhausted Nancy falls asleep in English class, and she thinks she sees Tina standing outside the classroom door. Tina speaks to her from a bloody body bag, and Nancy sees the bag dragged away by some unseen hand. She drifts out of the classroom and follows the bloody trail down into the basement. On the way, she is confronted by a female hall monitor, who scolds her for not having a pass. Leaving the girl behind, Nancy turns around when she speaks to Nancy in a man's voice, brandishing the weird knife-glove and cackling at her. Nancy goes down into the basement and is confronted by the killer, who is dressed in the same sweater and hat. His skin is horribly scarred, burned almost beyond recognition. He traps Nancy in the boiler room and backs her against the wall, taunting her. ""Come to Freddy!"" he says, but just before he can slash her with the glove, Nancy burns her arm on a hot pipe. The burn wakes her up, and she disrupts her English class by screaming and jumping out of her chair. Even though she is now awake, she has a large burn mark on her arm. Embarassed and frightened, she leaves school for the day. She visits Rod in prison and confirms her fears: Rod is having the same nightmare, haunted by the same figure with the glove. She tells Rod that she knows he didn't kill Tina, and leaves.Nancy has another incident where she is threatened by ""Freddy""; she falls asleep in the bathtub and she is pulled underwater, dragged into some kind of abyss underneath. She manages to swim back up to the opening of her bathtub and pulls herself to safety. Marge, hearing Nancy's screaming, bursts into the bathroom, but Nancy tries to pretend she simply fell. Marge sends Nancy to bed, but Nancy is now afraid to sleep. She drinks coffee constantly and has a fresh pot hidden in her room, just in case.Nancy enlists Glen's help in an experiment. It appears as if she asks Glen to follow her, but she is in her nightclothes, so we presume she is dreaming. Nancy goes to the jail where Rod is being held, and by peering in the window she can see his cell. Rod is asleep, and she can see the killer approaching him, walking right through the bars of Rod's cell. Nancy yells for Glen but he is no longer there; instead, the voice of the killer answers ""I'm here, Nancy!"" and he lunges at her, chasing her back to her house. She runs inside and finds she cannot escape because her stairs have suddenly turned into a sticky mess. The killer smashes the window on the front door and peers inside as Nancy struggles to get away; he is wearing Tina's face as a mask, and imitating her voice, he says ""Nancy, help me, please! Save me from Freddy!"" Nancy wakes up, and she is furious to find Glen asleep next to her bed, as she had asked him to keep watch and wake her if it looked like she was having a nightmare.Nancy and Glen hurry over to the jail to see Rod, as Nancy is convinced the killer is going to strike. Sure enough, before they can intervene, Rod's nightmare becomes real and an unseen hand twists his bedsheets around his neck, stringing him up in his cell and breaking his neck. Lt. Thompson is skeptical of Nancy's claims that they are being haunted in their dreams, as it appears Rod simply hung himself. Both Marge and Lt. Thompson seem to share an unspoken realization about Nancy's allegations, but they will not admit anything to Nancy.Instead, Marge takes Nancy to a sleep clinic where they monitor her body as she sleeps. Her nightmare sends the instruments haywire because of its intensity, and when they wake Nancy up, she has a sudden gray streak in her hair from terror. There is another shock for all of them: Nancy is inexplicably holding the killer's Fedora. She says she was holding onto it when she woke up.Nancy's mother continues to deny that anything strange is going on, and she insists that Nancy get some sleep. Instead Nancy produces the Fedora and points out that it has a name written inside: Fred Krueger. Marge denies knowing who that is, and Nancy reacts angrily. Nancy has a conversation with Glen where Glen tells her that certain zen masters could control their dreams. Nancy asks what they would do if they met a monster in their dreams, and Glen says they would turn their back on it. If you take away a nightmare's energy, it disappears. Glen is surprised that Nancy believes she will die because of a nightmare, and also that she is reading books on creating booby traps and survival techniques.Nancy's mother finally opens up to her and tells her the truth. Taking Nancy down into their own basement, Marge tells her about Fred Krueger, who was a murderer that preyed on young children. When Krueger was apprehended, a technicality (being an improperly signed search warrant) caused the evidence against him to be inadmissable, and he was not convicted and was hence, released from prison. As a result, she and Nancy's father, along with other parents in the neighborhood, murdered Krueger on their own by setting him on fire. Marge reaches into the furnace and removes a dirty bundle; unwrapping it, she produces Freddy's glove, which she took the night they murdered him. Nancy realizes that Freddy is out for revenge, somehow reaching from beyond the grave to murder them in their dreams.Nancy tries to warn Glen but his parents will not allow her to talk to him. She receives a taunting phone call from Kreuger, even after she rips the phone out of the wall, and she realizes that Glen is about to die. Nancy can't rescue him because her mother has placed metal bars on all the windows and doors. Glen falls asleep and is killed by Freddy, being sucked into his bed and apparently shredded until nothing is left but gore, which erupts into a horrible fountain all over his bedroom.Nancy realizes she is now alone and must face Freddy or die. Calling her father, she tells him that she is going to go and get Freddy and bring him out of her dream, and she wants her father to be there to arrest Freddy when she does. Lt. Thompson doesn't believe her, but he patronizes her so that she will go to sleep.Nancy sets up a number of booby traps in the house for Freddy in order to give herself an advantage after she 'captures' him. After saying goodnight to her mother, who is now completely drunk, Nancy falls asleep and goes down into her basement. There she finds a door that was never really there before, and it leads down a long staircase into another basement. She continues to climb further and further downwards, following ladders and stairwells, until she is in Freddy's boiler room. Freddy is nowhere to be found, and time is running out before Nancy's alarm goes off and wakes her up. Finally he attacks her and she struggles with him; her nightmare suddenly shifts and they are outside of her house. Nancy's scheme succeeds, and she brings Freddy into the real world, holding onto him as her alarm goes off. The booby traps she has rigged for Freddy help her get an edge on him, but she is unable to get the attention of her father; the cop he has posted to watch Nancy's house seems to be unable to understand that Nancy needs help.Freddy chases Nancy through her house and down into her basement, where she sets him on fire. Lt. Thompson breaks into the house, but he and Nancy are shocked to see fiery footprints leading out of the basement. They follow the trail upstairs and find Freddy struggling with Marge in her bed. When they pull back the bedclothes, Freddy is gone. Marge is nothing but a charred corpse, and the body disappears into the bed. The supernatural manifestation shocks Lt. Thompson, but Nancy seems resolute. She asks to be alone for a moment and when Lt. Thompson leaves, Freddy appears, rising up out of the bed. Nancy turns her back on him this time, remembering what Glen told her. She curses Freddy, telling him ""You're nothing. You're shit."" He lunges at her, but her lack of fear renders him powerless, and he vanishes into thin air.Nancy leaves the bedroom and suddenly finds herself outside, dressed for school. Marge stands on the porch and sees Nancy off to school in a loving way, telling Nancy that she is going to quit drinking. Glen, Rod, and Tina pull up in Glen's car to take Nancy to school. When Nancy gets in, the convertible roof suddenly slams shut over their heads; the roof is red and green, like Freddy's sweater. The windows go up and the car drives off, with all four of them trapped inside. Marge seems oblivious, waving goodbye to the kids, when suddenly Freddy's arm smashes outwards through the small window in the front door. In a bizarre movement, Marge's entire body is pulled through the tiny window, and she is gone."

He thinks it's mutual, then without warning, she heads back to L.A. and Jake.

Aging, injured and in need of money, he is contacted by an old acquaintance, the shady gambler and nightclub owner Jake Wise (James Woods), who wants Terry to find Jake's girlfriend Jessie Wyler (Rachel Ward), daughter of the Outlaws' owner. Jake claims that Jessie assaulted him, stole money and fled. Terry is reluctant to take on the job, but needs the money and knows Wise is capable of blackmailing him.Terry gets in touch with Jessie's mother (Jane Greer), ostensibly to find out where Jessie can be found, but mainly to convince Mrs. Wyler and her business partner Ben Caxton (Richard Widmark) to reinstate him on the team. Mrs. Wyler makes clear that she has no interest in his football career. She's willing to pay him more than Jake would if he will find Jessie for her. Beyond that, she has no use for him. Hank Sully (Alex Karras), the team's trainer, strongly advises Terry to stay away from Jake and offers to help Terry get a coaching job.

Moscow on the Hudson,1984,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087747/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A Russian saxophonist visiting New York with a circus troupe suddenly decides to defect from the USSR during a shopping trip to a department store, but he finds adjusting to American life more difficult than he imagined. A Russian circus visits the US. A clown wants to defect, but doesn't have the nerve. His saxophone playing friend however comes to the decision to defect in the middle of Bloomingdales. He is befriended by the black security guard and falls in love with the Italian immigrant from behind the perfume counter. We follow his life as he works his way through the American dream and tries to find work as a musician.—Zaphod <aaa@scs.leeds.ac.uk> Vladimir Ivanoff is a saxophonist with a Moscow based circus. Unlike his best friend, circus clown Anatoly, who hates all about living in the Soviet Union, Vladimir is generally content with his life, seeing the things with which he has to deal, such as standing in long lines for such basic items as toilet paper and shoes that don't fit, just part and parcel of his Soviet life. The circus is traveling to New York City for a show, during which time Anatoly plans to defect, which may be the worst kept secret within the circus, especially as their KGB handlers want Vladimir to spy on Anatoly about such plans. But when push comes to shove, it is Vladimir who senses an opportunity to defect, he doing so despite knowing that he will probably never see his family or friends back in the Soviet Union ever again. Vladimir has his own view of the American dream, the general concept of freedom which appeals to him the most despite not truly understanding what it means. He finds that almost everyone he meets, all immigrants in one form or another, all have their American dream, their own pursuit of which which may be incompatible with his own fulfillment of being an American.—Huggo Set against the backdrop of the Cold War and Soviet political repression of the early 1980s prior to perestroika, Moscow on the Hudson tells the story of Vladimir Ivanoff (Robin Williams), a saxophonist with the Moscow circus.The story begins in New York with Vladimir advising a newly arrived Frenchman that he is on the wrong New York bus and giving him instructions on how to get to his destination. He then tells the Frenchman that it is always difficult getting around the city when one first arrives. Vladimir then begins remembering his own arrival to New York from Russia, and the scene shifts to Vladimir riding on a Russian bus some time earlier.Vladimir exits the bus and immediately witnesses a group of three people holding signs being accosted by two men, likely KGB agents or secret police, who force them into a nearby car and confiscate their signs. Vladimir then inquires of a passing Russian soldier if the nearby queue is for toilet paper; the soldier replies that it is for shoes. Vladimir joins the queue and obtains three pairs of shoes in the only size (38) now available.Vladimir arrives late to rehearsal at the circus and Boris (Savely Kramarov), one of the apparatchik assigned to the circus, criticizes him harshly and implies that he may miss the approaching trip to New York City. Vladimir tells him the reason he was late and ultimately gives Boris one pair of shoes obtained from the queue.Later, while Vladimir is riding with his friend, circus clown Anatoly Cherkasov (Elya Baskin), in Anatoly's Lada, Anatoly begins expressing his discontent with life in Russia, claiming that he is an oppressed artist. Vladimir expresses disinterest in Anatoly's complaints. Anatoly stops to buy fuel for his car from a mobile black-market gasoline dealer. While the friends wait for the gasoline seller to fill Anatoly's jerrycans, the two practice their English. Anatoly reveals to Vladimir in English that he plans to defect during the upcoming trip to New York. Vladimir is disconcerted that Anatoly has told him this as he is obligated to inform on him. Anatoly shouts in English at the uncomprehending fuel seller and oblivious passing motorists that he wants to see the world.Anatoly leaves Vladimir at another queue; as Vladimir exits the vehicle, Anatoly asks if he will be coming by the apartment at 9:00 p.m. as usual and Vladimir agrees. After inquiring and determining that toilet paper can be purchased at this queue, Vladimir begins to walk to the end of the excessively long line but meets with a neighborhood friend, Leonid, already standing in line. During the ensuing conversation, Leonid reveals that he was once a teacher but is now paving roads after the authorities had sent him to a camp for protesting the war in Afghanistan. Leonid also reveals that the authorities had declared him to be crazy for protesting the war. After agreeing to talk later, Leonid advises Vladimir to never go crazy.Vladimir returns home to his family, who are overjoyed that he has obtained toilet paper. Vladimir announces that he won't be staying for dinner as he is meeting Svetlana. Vladimir's mother expresses a desire for Vladimir to marry Svetlana, and Vladimir remarks that he doesn't want another marriage.Vladimir meets with Svetlana, and they both walk to Anatoly's apartment for their date. Svetlana expresses a desire for Vladimir to join the communist party as it would make obtaining an apartment when they get married easier; Vladimir responds that he is not a ""joiner"". At the apartment, after Anatoly leaves, Vladimir gives Svetlana a gift -- a roll of toilet paper. Svetlana expresses her jealousy that Vladimir gets to see America without her and hints that she would like Vladimir to obtain designer jeans for her.Vladimir returns home drunk from vodka. In the morning, around the breakfast table, Vladimir's grandfather, Nicholai Ivanoff, aggressively criticizes the news reports on the television and Russia's leaders in general. As Vladimir is leaving the building with packed suitcases for the circus trip to America, he is intercepted by the two circus-assigned apparatchik waiting at the entrance. They question Vladimir about his grandfather's anti-Soviet behavior and imply that he may be senile and need to be committed. Vladimir responds that he is just a comedian, an old man, and a war hero who should just be ignored. They also reveal that they are aware that Vladimir and Svetlana have been using Anatoly's apartment for their ""sexual encounters"". Both agents finally reveal that they want Vladimir to ""keep an eye on"" Anatoly Cherkasov during the trip to America in exchange for protecting his grandfather.The Moscow circus arrives in New York and are shuttled around in a chartered bus. The performers are amused at the colorful environment that is New York, which strongly contrasts with the bleak surrounding of Moscow (as portrayed earlier). During the bus ride, Anatoly writes ""freedom"" in the dust on the bus window, and Vladimir quickly wipes it off.The performers stay at the Howard Johnson Hotel, and Vladimir and Anatoly happen to be sharing a room. Vladimir revels in the American custom of taking the towels, which he packs into his suitcase, and the quality of the toilet paper. Vladimir reveals to Anatoly that it is no coincidence they are sharing a room together because the apparatchik watching over the circus want him to ""spy on"" Anatoly.During a formal reception, Anatoly reveals to Vladimir that he intends to defect during the opening parade and his opening bicycle routine; Vladimir remarks, ""Good. They grab you and throw you right to bear"". Vladimir and Anatoly enter a bathroom, and the two Apparatchik, who have been shadowing Anatoly throughout the evening, emerge from the same toilet stall just as Anatoly was about to comment on his plans. The Apparatchik comment that they will soon be back in Moscow, but otherwise all leave the bathroom without further drama.The next day during the opening circus performance, Anatoly attempts to defect but is met by the Apparatchik agents.The following day, the performers are allowed to shop at Bloomingdale's for 30 minutes before going to the airport to return to Russia. Vladimir meets a perfume clerk at Bloomingdale's, Lucia Lomardo (María Conchita Alonso), while attempting to find blue jeans for Svetlana. Anatoly once more reveals to Vladimir that he is going to defect in Bloomingdale's. Vladimir angrily challenges Anatoly to just do it and stop informing him of the plan. However, Anatoly is shadowed by the quieter of the Apparatchik and loses his nerve.As the performers are being led back to the bus, Vladimir attempts to buy the designer jeans for Svetlana. Anatoly seemingly dares Vladimir to defect in his stead. Vladimir then attempts to defect to one of Bloomingdale's security guards, Lionel Witherspoon (Cleavant Derricks). A clerk announces the defection, and the Apparatchik, who are distracted by their own shopping, rush over to prevent it. A chase ensues through Bloomingdale's, out onto the street, and back into Bloomingdale's. Vladimir then attempts to hide behind Lucia's counter. Orlando Ramirez (Alejandro Rey), an immigration lawyer, approaches and gives Lucia his card to give to Vladimir. After trying to hide inside Lucia's dress, Vladimir crawls away through Bloomingdale's but once again encounters Lionel. Boris and the other Apparatchik arrive and confront Vladimir, but Lionel defends him. Boris first pleads with Vladimir to return and then threatens, but Vladimir repeats, ""I defect"", to the cheers of the rapidly assembling crowd. Connie Chung and an ABC News crew are already on scene. The FBI arrive and interview Vladimir about why he is defecting and whether or not he has relatives or friends in America. Lionel, basking in the glare of the media, offers to take in Vladimir after revealing he knows no one in America outside of Lionel and Lucia. As a final parting gesture, Vladimir rushes out onto the street as the charted bus of circus performers is leaving and says goodbye to his saxophone, which had been left on the bus. He also communicates to Anatoly that he is now free (a free bird).Lionel Witherspoon (Cleavant Derricks), an African American security guard who has just protected Vladimir from his furious Russian handlers during Vladimir's defection at Bloomingdale's, takes him home to Harlem to live with Lionel's mother, unemployed father, sister, and cranky but good-hearted grandfather--a living arrangement noticeably similar to that of Vladimir's family back in Moscow.With the help of sympathetic immigration attorney Orlando Ramirez (Alejandro Rey), a naturalized citizen from Cuba who witnessed Vladimir's defection, Vladimir soon adapts to life in America. Vladimir attempts to find work despite speaking little English and fearing the threat of his former KGB handlers. He initially lives in poor neighborhoods and takes low-paying jobs such as fast-food service, limousine driver, and sidewalk merchant.Vladimir starts a relationship with Lucia. At a party celebrating Lucia's becoming an American citizen, Vladimir proposes to her; but she refuses and breaks up with him. A little while later, Lionel decides to move to Alabama to be with his young son; and Vladimir learns from a friend of his sister that his beloved grandfather back home in Moscow has died.Grieving, Vladimir goes to a Russian nightclub to ease his mind. When he returns home, late to his apartment building and drunk, he is mugged by two young men. He later reports the incident to the police with Orlando present, and the two go to a diner where Vladimir rants about his misfortunes. A nearby Russian immigrant overhears the conversation, and interrupts Vladimir to disagree, leading the two into a tense confrontation that is settled after Vladimir comes to appreciate his good fortune of living in America. Soon after, Lucia reunites with Vladimir telling him that she is not ready for marriage but would love to live with an immigrant, and Lionel moves back from Alabama and takes over Vladimir's job driving a limousine.In the end, Vladimir gets a job as a saxophonist in the band at the Russian nightclub, with time to play the music he loves during the day. He encounters the former apparatchik Boris operating a hot dog stand. (Boris had lost his status back in the Soviet Union after Vladimir's defection.) The former apparatchik is glad to see Vladimir and gives him a free hot dog, showing his appreciation for the life he too now has in America."

Phil is everything Jeffrey would like to be: popular, rich, and the best gin rummy player the club has ever seen. Jeffrey's coming-of-age includes a romance with the very pretty Carla Samson, but the shine on Phil Brody's philosophy of life wears off when he uncovers a significant flaw in his character.—garykmcd In 1963 Brooklyn, Jeffrey feels boxed-in in his home, life, and dreams. At the Flamingo beach club his eyes are opened to a world filled with what he sees as beautiful people with perfect lives. He turns his back on his family in pursuit of Easy Street. Jeffrey falls in love with pretty beach girl Carla and appears to be on his way to a cushy job selling sports cars for the slick Mr. Brody. It all begins to fall apart when Jeffrey suspects that Mr. Brody misled him. Jeffrey must finally choose between his dreams and honor. He returns to his family, which he now sees not as a box, but as a foundation.—Cary <pincus@aracor.com> In the summer of 1963 Brooklyn, New York, 18-year-old Jeffrey Willis (Matt Dillon) is invited to spend the Fourth of July at the exclusive El Flamingo Beach Club in Far Rockaway, Long Island, New York. Steve Dawkins (Brian McNamara) and Henry ""Hawk"" Ganz (Fisher Stevens), two friends who used to live in the neighborhood whose families are now members of the El Flamingo, need a third player for a gin rummy game at the club. Jeffrey, who is a whiz at math and cards, helps them win $89.90 in a penny-a-point gin rummy game. Jeffrey is impressed by the luxurious club and is smitten upon meeting the beautiful, blonde Carla Samson (Janet Jones) from California who is staying the summer with her relatives, the wealthy Brody family.After the holiday buffet and fireworks, Jeffrey and his friends are leaving when a car stalls in the parking lot. Jeffrey examines the engine and gets the car started. The parking lot attendant offers him a job and puts Jeffrey to work.The next morning, Jeffrey tells his father, plumber Arthur Willis (Hector Elizondo), that he has taken the job. Arthur is upset as he arranged with one of his plumbing clients for Jeffrey to work as an office boy at an engineering firm in Brooklyn. Arthur dreams of his son becoming an engineer, but Jeffrey does not want to spend his summer in an office. Jeffrey places the $40 he made in tips on the table, confident he can contribute to his college tuition, but his father dismisses the gesture, saying that working for tips is not an honest job.That afternoon at the El Flamingo, Jeffrey and other parking attendants watch a high-stakes gin rummy game in which ""king"" of the game Phil Brody (Richard Crenna), who owns a foreign car dealership, plays against retired Air Force Colonel Cal Eastland (Frank Campanella), who owns the El Flamingo. Jeffrey is impressed by Phil Brody's style and his habit of holding his cards in an upside-down fan pattern. That night, Jeffrey tries to imitate holding cards in the upside-down fan, but cannot master it.Phil Brody's daughter, Joyce (Carole R. Davis), invites Steve Dawkins to dinner, while Joyce's cousin, Carla Samson, invites Jeffrey. Phyllis (Jessica Walter), Phil's snotty wife, is aghast to have a parking lot attendant come for dinner, but Phil Brody takes a shine to Jeffrey after the young man compliments his card playing. Phil teaches Jeffrey some of the finer points of cards, explaining that he does not have a son to share his expertise with. Carla and Jeffrey have a nice evening and share a kiss as he leaves.The next day at the El Flamingo, Phil arranges for Jeffrey to be promoted to cabana boy. Over the next few weeks, Jeffrey makes a lot of money in tips and wins a lot of money in penny-a-point gin rummy games with his friends.One day, Phil Brody takes Jeffrey to his Long Island car dealership, Brody Motors, and lets him drive an Italian-made sports car. Phil tells Jeffrey that he never went to college, but took some night courses at New York University and believes education is not as essential as sales ability, because it is the salesmen of the world who make the money. Phil believes Jeffrey would make a good salesman and will give Jeffrey a job whenever he wants one.Jeffrey, who has been accepted at the Pratt Institute and is on the waiting list for Columbia University, tells his family that he has decided not to go to college and repeats things that Phil said about salesmen making the most money. Arthur Willis' dream is for his children to be educated, but Jeffrey insists he is going to be a car salesman.The next day, Arthur Willis comes to the club and invites Jeffrey to join the family for a meal at a nice restaurant after his shift ends, but Jeffrey and his friends are going to the horse races in Yonkers. Arthur and Jeffrey argue until Phil steps in, complimenting Arthur on what a fine son he has and advising him to let Jeffrey spend time with his friends.At the horse races, Jeffrey and his friends lose money after betting on a horse that was supposed to be a ""sure thing."" Afterward at a diner, some guys from the racetrack start a fight with them and police arrest them all. Arthur bails his son out of jail. On the drive home, Jeffrey and his father get into an argument about money. Jeffrey criticizes his father for saving all his money and making them live in a ""dump"" in Brooklyn. Hearing that, Arthur slaps his son in the face. When he gets home, Jeffrey packs some clothes and says he is moving out. Arthur mocks him, asking if he is going to become a ""fast car salesman."" Arthur admits that fast things frighten him. He also says that there are two important things in life: ""finding out what you do well and finding out what makes you happy"". Arthur says ""if God is smiling on you, they're both the same thing"".Jeffrey sleeps in a cabana at the club and the next day tells Phil Brody he is ready to work for him. Phil offers him a job as a stock boy at his dealership in Yonkers. Jeffrey is distraught as he was expecting to be a car salesman, but Phil explains he has to grow into the position.That night, Jeffrey and Carla go on a date and make love for the first (and only) on the beach. Carla hopes he can come visit her in Los Angeles where she will attend college. Jeffrey and Carla then say goodbye to each other.On Labor Day, Phil and his team play another high-stakes gin rummy game against Col. Eastland and his team. As usual, Brody is winning, but Jeffrey notices a man named Big Sid observing the game and signaling Brody about Eastland's cards. Big Sid collapses from sunstroke, falling onto Eastland, and both are taken to the hospital. The other members of Eastland's team, Charlie Cooper and Mario Minetta, need a third player and Jeffrey volunteers. Jeffrey plays against Phil and wins several hands. The game goes on for hours and moves inside when it gets dark and Jeffrey continues to win. On the last hand, the men agree to double the stakes. As Phil hesitates about which card to discard, Jeffrey comments that it is not so easy to win without Big Sid there to help him, then puts down the winning hand. Angry at losing, Phil storms away from the card table. Delighted at their windfall, Jeffrey's two teammates give him a share of the winnings. Jeffrey tells them how Phil has been cheating all summer with the help of Big Sid.A little later that evening, Phil comes to congratulate Jeffrey on winning and offers to let him be a salesman at his new dealership in Newport, California, so he can be close to Carla. Jeffrey declines and tells Brody that he told the others about his cheating scam. Jeffrey tells his friends at the beach club goodbye and goes to Larry's Fish House where his family is having dinner. He makes up with Arthur and says he intends to move back home, then gives his father a hug."
Sixteen Candles,1984,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088128/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A girl's ""sweet"" sixteenth birthday is anything but special: her family forgets about it, and she suffers from every embarrassment possible. Samantha's life is going downhill fast. The 16-year-old has a crush on the most popular boy in school, and the geekiest boy in school has a crush on her. Her sister is getting married, and with all the excitement the rest of her family forgets her birthday. Add to all this two sets of horrendously embarrassing grandparents, a foreign-exchange student named Long Duk Dong, and behold the makings of a hilarious journey into young-womanhood.—Rick Munoz <rick.munoz@his.com> Samantha Baker's Sweet Sixteen is anything but. Her high-school crush doesn't know she's alive, her parents forget her birthday, and she suffers every humiliation possible through the course of one day. Will things turn around for Sam? Will this turn out to be the best birthday ever? On the pivotal morning of her Sweet Sixteen, bright-eyed high school sophomore Samantha realises her family has forgotten her birthday. And with her older sister's wedding ceremony only hours away, Samantha has a lot on her plate: pluck up the courage to win over Jake, the handsome boy of her dreams; fend off persistent admirer Ted the Geek, and, hopefully, find love. But will Jake ever notice her? Will Samantha blow out her sixteen candles and make her wish come true?—Nick Riganas Awkward high school sophomore Samantha ""Sam"" Baker (Molly Ringwald) struggles to get through the day of her 16th birthday, which her entire family forgets because her older sister, Ginny (Blanche Baker), is getting married the next day. Sam is also plagued by her ongoing infatuation with popular and attractive senior Jake Ryan (Michael Schoeffling). Her day at school fares no better when she finds out that her completed ""sex quiz,"" which she surreptitiously slipped to her friend, never reached her (and, unbeknownst to either of them, was intercepted by Jake Ryan himself). Sam panics, as the quiz contains personal information, including the fact that she is a virgin and is saving herself for Jake. At the same time, she doesn't know that Jake has the hots for her as well, but is too insecure to even talk to her.Samantha has a whole new set of problems when she arrives home to find that both sets of grandparents are staying for the duration of the wedding visit. On top of it all, one set of grandparents brings along bizarre Chinese exchange student Long Duk Dong (Gedde Watanabe). Sam's grandparents force her to take him along to her school dance that night and, to Sam's amazement, it takes ""The Donger"" only five minutes to find an unlikely girlfriend: the tallish, large-breasted jock, Marlene, promptly nicknamed ""Lumberjack.""A running subplot involves a geeky freshman, (Anthony Michael Hall) who continually (and unsuccessfully) tries to bed his love interest, Sam, to satisfy a bet with his friends. The character is referred to on several occasions in the movie as either ""Ted"" or ""Farmer Ted"", but he is credited solely as ""the Geek.""In the auto-shop room during the dance, Sam and Ted begin talking, and Sam confesses her love for Jake. Upon hearing this, Ted tells her that Jake has been asking about her at the dance, and they agree that Sam should just go and talk to him. As she's leaving, Ted reveals the wager to Sam, who, in her excited state, agrees to loan him her panties to help him win a dozen floppy disks.Later (after a peepshow of Sam's panties for $1 admission, which she does not find out about until the next day), Ted and his equally unwelcome friends, Cliff (Darren Harris) and Bryce (John Cusack), crash the senior after-party at Jake's house during which the entire house is completely trashed. A small group of beer-chugging jocks pin Farmer Ted under a glass table, abduct his two geek friends, and take them for a joyride in the trunk of their car before releasing them unharmed.At night's end, Jake finds Ted trapped under the table and they begin to talk. Jake inquires further about Sam, and Ted explains the situation. Jake makes a deal with Ted: If Ted lets Jake keep Sam's panties, then he will let Ted drive home his inebriated, stuck-up, prom queen girlfriend, Carolyn Mulford (Haviland Morris), in Jake's father's Rolls Royce. They never get home because the very drunk Carolyn makes moves on Ted while he's driving before passing out. Ted the Geek takes the opportunity to drive over to Cliff and Bryce's house to ask them to take a photo of him with Carolyn together in the back seat of the car.At Samantha's house the next morning, after some ensuing madness with all her obnoxious relatives, the family eventually makes up before the wedding and apologizes for forgetting her birthday. They drive to the church, where a very nervous Ginny takes a few too many tranquilizers and causes a scene throughout the wedding ceremony.Meanwhile, Jake goes on a search for Samantha at her house, only to find Long Duk Dong there getting over a bad hangover, who tells him where Sam went. Jake finds Carolyn and Ted the Geek passed out in the back seat of the Rolls in a nearby parking lot, where he uses the excuse of finding them together to break up with Carolyn (who had surprisingly fallen for Ted, and thus doesn't mind the breakup very much).Afterward, Jake drives to the church just in time to meet an incredulous Sam after her sister's wedding. Here, Jake and Samantha finally meet face to face for the first time, and Jake invites her over to his house rather than to Ginny's wedding reception. Samantha accepts. The movie concludes with Jake and Samantha sharing a kiss over a birthday cake with 16 candles."

After being captured, he was imprisoned in a North Vietnamese prisoner of war (POW) camp and remained in enemy hands even after the conflict ended. The U.S. government classified him as MIA (Missing in Action), until he was able to escape after seven years and return home to the United States. Believing MIA soldiers are still held captive in communist Vietnam, Braddock crusades on their behalf, but is unable to provide any evidence for his claims.At the request of the U.S. government, Braddock returns to Saigon, now known as Ho Chi Minh City in the communist People's Socialist Republic of Vietnam, to participate on an investigative committee about the missing soldiers which is led by Senator Maxwell Porter (David Tress). Upon arrival, Braddock recognizes Colonel Vinh (Ernie Ortega), the ruthless North Vietnamese officer who tortured Braddock at the POW camp.

The club is filled with black soldiers from a nearby segregated Army base. Sergeant Waters (Adolph Caesar) stumbles out of the club. He staggers down the street, past black soldiers, civilians, to the edge of town and into a wooded area. He looks up at the camera, and pleads with a hoarse, drunken cackle: 'They still...hate you! They still...hate you!' A semi-automatic handgun goes off, blowing him on to his back. Seconds later, a second round is fired.At the Army barracks, Captain Taylor (Dennis Lipscomb) has the troops searched. He doesn't want anyone going into Tynin, the nearby town, looking for rednecks. The men are convinced the Klan murdered Sergeant Waters.Captain Davenport (Howard E. Rollins, Jr.), a graduate of Howard University Law School, is called in to investigate the murder. He arrives in Tynin on an interstate bus. He is wearing aviator sunglasses and is asleep in the back, behind the white passengers. 'Hey, wake up, boy! You said Tynin, didn't ya?' says the driver. Corporal Ellis (Robert Townsend) is standing by his Army jeep, waiting for Davenport to disembark. He is shocked to see a black officer, but is also proud. He collects Davenport's bags and drives him back to base.Colonel Nivens (Trey Wilson) gives Davenport the Waters file. Nivens has doubts about Davenport's investigation. He doesn't want outsiders like the NAACP, the Negro Press, nor 'the paper-shuffling desk jockeys in Washington' involved. He instructs Davenport to complete his investigation in three days. He also expects Davenport, the first black officer the men ever saw, to be an 'example' to the colored soldiers.Captain Davenport is ushered in to see Captain Taylor, who commands the racially segregated Company. Taylor is shocked when Captain Davenport enters. Taylor inquires about Davenport's background. 'Had I known you'd be e a Negro I would have requested the immediate suspension of the investigation. These local people aren't going to charge a white man in this Parish on your say-so...Will you take off those damn sunglasses?' 'I like these,' says Davenport, 'they're like McArthur's.'Davenport is at the enlisted men's barracks. Ellis tells Davenport that Taylor had questioned two white officers who were on the road the night of the murder. Captain Davenport interviews his first soldier. Private Wilkie (Art Evans) gives a summary of the all-black Company. The soldiers were recruited from a baseball team in the Negro Leagues. As for Sergeant Waters-he was a veteran of the First World War, 'all spit and polish.' Waters had taken Wilkie's Sergeant's stripes-demoted him to Private-- because Wilkie was found drunk on duty.Davenport asks about Water's relationship with his men. Wilkie replies Waters didn't like the Southern men, except for C.J.-probably because C.J. was the best ball player on the team--and he could sing, too. 'Boy could he sing.'Flashback to C.J. playing his guitar and singing the blues at Big Mary's club. Big Mary joins him onstage, and the soldiers are enjoying C.J.'s tune, 'Low Down Dirty Shame.' After the song Waters and Wilkie approach C.J. Memphis (Larry Riley). Waters asks him if he's from Mississippi. 'Yessuh.' Waters tells C.J. he reminds him of Blues singers from Mississippi, and of a club in France during the First World War-the 'Café Napoleon.'Present day, Davenport's interview with Wilkie: The Sarge was a 'good' man, Wilkie says. Good to his men, wrote home to his wife every day. But, his attitude could change in an instant. 'Two people, sir. Mr. Warm and Mr. Cold.' Wilkie asks Davenport if it's true that when Sergeant Waters was found his stripes and insignia were still on his uniform. Yes. 'Something's wrong, ain't it, sir? 'The Klan boys can't stand to see us in these uniforms. They usually take the stripes and stuff off before they lynch us.'Private First Class Peterson (Denzel Washington) enters. He called Sergeant Waters 'Stone Ass'-no offense.Flashback: A baseball game between the soldiers and a white team. C. J. excels on defense-catching a long fly ball-and on offense, hitting a monstrous home run. Captain Taylor is ecstatic over the performance of his black players, to the chagrin of his fellow white officers. They win the game, then go to the mess hall to celebrate. The soldiers are laughing and drinking; C.J. sings another of his songs. Captain Waters enters and tells the men to 'knock it off. We don't need no more of that guitar-picking-sittin'-around-the-shack music today, C.J.' They've got a work detail, painting the lobby of the officer's club. Private Smalls (David Harris) asks: Why can't the officers paint their own damn club? Waters: The reason for issuing an order is none of your business. Waters is up in Private Small's face: When I give you an order, I want it done! As Waters leaves, Peterson asks: What kind of colored man are you? 'I'm a soldier, Peterson. The kind of colored man that don't like lazy, shiftless Negroes.' Peterson replies 'You don't have to call us names.' Waters: the Germans call you names too, you going to complain to Hitler? C.J. says they couldn't do too much to the Nazi's with paintbrushes. 'Are you mockin' me, C.J.? Whatever an ignorant low-class Geechee like you has to say ain't worth payin' attention to. Is it!' 'I reckon not, Sarge,' says C.J. Peterson: You're a creep, Waters! Waters: If it wasn't for you Southern niggers, white folks wouldn't think we was all fools. Peterson: Where are you from, England? The men nervously retreat from Peterson. 'Looks like we got us a wise-ass Alabama boy here.' Waters gets up in Peterson's face and pushes him. Peterson pushes back. 'Get your...hands off me!' Waters dares Peterson to hit him. Just then Captain Taylor enters and congratulates the team on their victory. Only seven more games and they'll be the first colored team in Army history to play the Yankees. He gives them the rest of the day off. After Taylor leaves, Waters promises Peterson he'll teach him a lesson, and demands Peterson fight him. Peterson accepts and Waters leaves. The men warn Peterson Waters will fight dirty. Outside the barracks, the two men fight. Peterson is winning. Down on his face Waters scoops up a handful of dirt and throws it in Peterson's eyes. Peterson is unable to see. Waters delivers a flurry of vicious punches and knocks him out.Present day, the interview with Peterson: Peterson says he never reported the incident. Waters left him alone after that so he 'just played ball.' 'I appreciate your honesty, Peterson,' says Davenport. 'Did you see Waters the night he was killed?' 'Uh, no sir. Smalls and I had guard duty.'Night. Davenport is typing his report. Taylor visits. He is submitting a request to have Davenport's investigation terminated. Taylor is emphatic that Davenport will not be able to get the truth on Waters' murder. Davenport asks Taylor why the file he received from Nivens did not include any mention of the two white officers who had an encounter with Waters the night he was murdered. Colonel Nivens had ordered it not included, Taylor says. Waters was killed with two .45 caliber slugs, Army issue. If the black soldiers had found out, there would have been a slaughter. Lt. Byrd and Captain Wilcox were the officers. 'Tell me what they told you,' says Davenport. 'Look, hotshot. They're not gonna let you charge those two men.'Flashback: The night Waters was murdered. Byrd and Wilcox are in their vehicle, in a wooded area approaching a bridge. They come across a drunken Sergeant Waters. 'I'll be damned. If it ain't the white boys,' says Waters. Though Waters is obviously drunk, Byrd is incensed that he won't salute. Wilcox implores him to let it go. Byrd refuses, insists Waters come to attention. Waters won't do 'nothin' white folks say to him, and starts crying. 'I've even killed for you.' Byrd knocks him to the ground and starts kicking him repeatedly. 'White men are killing for you, nigger. Good men are dyin' for you'. He cocks his pistol.Present day, Taylor and Davenport: Taylor: they claimed they left Waters at 23:10 and were back at the barracks by 23:30 and neither left until the following morning. Davenport replies: That's just white officers protecting their own. I'm arresting both of them, and you can consider yourself under arrest pending my charges against you. Captain Taylor: Colonel Nivens is part of their alibi. Nivens and other white officers were playing pool with Byrd and Wilcox until three in the morning.Davenport visits Colonel Nivens and requests authority to arrest Byrd and Wilcox. Nivens refuses, but does give Davenport permission to question them, provided a white officer is present.Davenport interviews another soldier, Private Henson (William Allen Young). Henson didn't like Waters on account of what he did to C.J. In fact he doesn't like officers at all, and doesn't want to talk to any officers, black or white. Davenport threatens to put him in the stockades unless he talks. Henson: There was a shooting. It happened last year at the end of the baseball season.Flashback: Waters barges into a darkened barracks with Wilkie, while the soldiers are sleeping. A colored soldier shot a white M.P., and he was chased down to the Army base. 'We got us a vicious, low down murdering piece of black trash in here somewhere-and a few people who helped him.' Waters has the barracks searched. Wilkie 'finds' a pistol under C.J.'s bunk. The men vouch for C.J.'s innocence. Private Henson says he saw someone sneaking into their barracks. Corporal Cobb (David Alan Grier) says C.J. was asleep before he, Cobb, went to bed. Waters is undeterred, and shows open contempt for 'C. J. Memphis' - 'cotton-picker', bowin', scrapin' in white folks faces. 'This man undermines us. That ""yasser-boss"" is hidin' somethin,' and jabs C.J. in the chest. With one punch, C.J. knocks Waters to the ground. Waters has C.J. arrested and taken away. Peterson gets dressed. He's seen the likes of Waters before: White man gives him a job as a servant, when the boss ain't lookin' ...he acts like the new boss...he can't look good unless he's standin' on you. Peterson leaves to tell the M.P.s that C.J. was in the barracks all night.Present day, the Davenport and Henson interview continues. Davenport asks Henson if Wilkie was the only one out of his bunk the night the white M.P. was killed. Henson: I guess...but I was a little juiced that night.Davenport questions Corporal Cobb about his best friend, C.J. Cobb tells Davenport C.J. was a 'country boy' and that jail cell started closing in on him in solitary.Flashback: Sergeant Waters visits C.J. in solitary. The charges are changed-he's now charged with striking a superior officer. They're talking about giving him five years. 'Why you doin' this to me, suh?' 'Don't feel too bad, C.J.. It has to be this way....The black race can't afford you no more...there used to be a time when we'd see someone like you singin', clowinin', yasser-bossin'..and we wouldn't do anything. Folks liked that. You were good. Homey kinda nigger. When they needed someone to mistreat...they paraded you. Reminded them of the good old days. Not no more. The day of the Geechee is gone, boy, and you're going with him. We can't let nobody go on beleivin' we're all fools like you. Waited a long time for you, boy, but I got ya.' Waters says he's already put three Geechees in jail, 'now, I've got you...one less fool for the race to be ashamed of.' Waters leaves. Tears stream quietly down C.J.'s face.Present day, Davenport and Cobb: Two days after speaking with Waters, C.J. was found hanging from the bars of his cell. The players protested C.J.'s suicide by throwing the last game of the season. After that the baseball team was broken up. The Sergeant 'started actin' funny, was drunk all the time.' Cobb gives Davenport the time he got in the night Waters was killed. And Peterson and Smalls? They were the last ones in--they had guard duty.Davenport interviews Lieutenant Byrd (Wings Hauser) and Captain Wilcox (Scott Paulin), the white officers who encountered Waters the night of his murder. Captain Taylor is present. Davenport: When did you last see Sergeant Waters? Lieutenant Byrd says it was the night he was killed-'I should have done it myself, the way he spoke to Wilcox and me...The goddamned nigger was disrespectful, no way a colored soldier speaks to a white officer like that.' Davenport challenges Byrd, 'You beat him up...and you shot him.' 'You get out of my face, boy, 'fore I kill you.' 'Like you killed Waters.' 'No!' Captain Wilcox says their weapons were turned in and cleared ballistics. Byrd adds: They were short of .45 caliber ammo. They were for M.P.s and special duty people only. 'No one on the bivouac was issued .45 caliber ammo.' Captain Taylor does not believe their stories. Why wasn't he told, he asks the officers. Wilcox: Nivens felt Taylor would go to Washington with it. Taylor: 'Consider yourselves under arrest, gentlemen. The charge is murder.' Davenport orders them released. Taylor: They're as guilty as hell. Charge them, I'll back you up. Davenport replies he does what the facts tell him, 'not you.'Davenport and Taylor are on the bridge near where Waters was killed. Davenport: I think Waters tricked the kid into attacking him.Davenport questions Wilkie again. Wilkie is seated in the barracks and wipes his sweaty palms on his uniform. He can't understand why Davenport wants to speak to him again. 'No, Waters was not a nice guy,' Wilkie says. Waters' demoting him made him mad, all the things he did for Waters. Davenport: You were his boy. You took care of the team. You ran his errands. You policed his quarters. You listened to his stories. You put the gun under C.J.s bunk. Wilkie: No! It wasn't me. It was Sarge who ordered me to do it. He said I'd get my stripes back. The Sarge just wanted to scare him; put him in jail for a few days, but then C.J. hit him, then he had C.J. where he wanted him. Waters despised C.J., but he hid it because everybody like C.J., but underneath there was a cray kind of hate, sometimes you could just feel it.Flashback: C.J. is singing in Big Mary's club. Waters is at the bar with Wilkie watching him. 'This kinda boy seems innocent...White boys envy his strength, his speed... He can't talk. Can't barely read or write his own name... he don't care. He'll tell you they like him. Colored folks ain't supposed to have so much sense. You know the damage one ignorant Negro can do?' He shares with Wilkie an incident that took place when he was in France during the First World War. 'We had won decorations. The white soldiers told the French gals we had tails. They found an ignorant colored soldier and paid him to tie a tail to his ass and run around half naked making monkey sounds...They put him on a big round table in the Café Napoleon. .. made him eat bananas in front of all them Frenchies. How the white boys danced that night...Passed out pictures with that boy's picture on it. Called him ""Moonshine"", ""King of the Monkeys."" And when we slit his throat you know that fool asked us what he'd done wrong? ...My Daddy told me we got to turn our backs to these kind, Wilkie...We are men. Soldiers. And I don't intend for our race to be cheated out of its place of honor and respect in this war because of fools like C.J. You watch everything he does. Everything.'Present day, Wilkie and Davenport: 'And I watched him,' says Wilkie. Davenport: Why didn't Waters pick on Peterson-they had the fight. Wilkie: Sarge liked Pete. Pete fought back. He was going to promote Pete. After C.J. died 'Pete' put together the protest that lost our last game. Then he kept to himself, or with Smalls.Outside a flare gun goes off. The soldiers are celebrating, and more flare guns are fired into the night sky, like fireworks. The men are shipping out; they are finally going to get a chance to fight. Davenport places Wilkie under arrest.Smalls goes AWOL but is caught. Davenport interrogates Smalls. Davenport: Peterson knew that I'd find out the two of you killed Waters. Smalls: It was Peterson, sir. It wasn't me.Flashback: Peterson and Smalls are walking across the bridge. They come across Waters, drunk on the ground. Peterson: I'm gonna enjoy this. He offers Waters a hand up, and then kicks him back down. Waters starts crying: C.J. could never make it. He was a clown. A clown in blackface. 'You got to be like them. But the rules are fixed.' In a high-pitched voice he sings a line from C.J.'s tune 'Low Down Dirty Shame' - the tune everyone loved. Then he says 'it doesn't make any difference...They still... hate you.' Peterson draws his weapon. 'Justice, Smalls. For C.J. For everybody.' He shoots Waters in the chest, knocking him on to his back.Present day: Davenport asks Smalls, 'And you call that justice?' Peterson is brought in, in handcuffs. He stares at Smalls. 'You told him, didn't you.' He laughs and turns to Davenport. 'I didn't kill much. Some things need getting rid of. Man like Waters never did nobody no good anyway, Cap'n.' Davenport: Who gave you the right to judge? To decide who is fit to be a Negro-and who is not? Who? Smalls and Peterson are taken away.Davenport is leaving the base as the soldiers are rolling out. Taylor, in aviator sunglasses, and Ellis, pull up alongside in a jeep. Taylor: So I guess that's it. You got your man. I was wrong. Davenport: So was I. Davenport, laden with bags and an overcoat, says to 'Charlie,' he could do with a lift. Captain Taylor offers Davenport a hand as he climbs into the back. 'I guess I'm gonna have to get used to Negroes with bars on their shoulders, Davenport. You know, being in charge.' Davenport puts on his sunglasses. 'Oh, you'll get used to it, Captain. You can bet your ass on that. You'll get used to it.'"
"Oh, God! You Devil",1984,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087835/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"George Burns returns as God, and as Satan. They battle over the soul of a young rock star who is willing to sell his soul to the devil. George Burns is back as God, but oops, here he is as Satan, too. A young rock star is ready to sell his soul to Satan, and Satan is all too happy to oblige. Oops! Seems the fellow was watched over by God as a baby, so now the Almighty and his nemesis have to duke it out over the soul.—Steve Derby <sderby@sdeco.com> In 1960 New York City, Arthur Shelton (John Doolittle) prays at the bedside of his young son, Bobby, who is sick with scarlet fever. On the street outside the apartment building, God (George Burns), dressed as an elderly man in a baseball cap and gray sweatsuit, writes the boy's name on a notepad and promises to watch over him.24 later in Los Angeles, California, the same Bobby Shelton (Ted Wass) is a struggling singer-songwriter married to Wendy (Roxanne Hart), a supportive wife and social worker. After another record company flatly rejects his latest composition, Bob by agrees to play a wedding for $500. Dejected, he tells himself he would ""sell his soul to the devil"" to be a success in the music business.The Devil (George Burns in a dual role), who is disguised as a cigar-smoking talent agent named Harry O. Tophet, receives Bobby's message while driving back from Miami after a personal assignment, and notices on his car computer that God ""watched over"" Bobby in 1960. The Devil, however, declares he has priority if a person directly asks for him.During the wedding reception, the Devil/Harry O. Tophet appears and gives Bobby his business card, promising to book him at venues such as Carnegie Hall and Madison Square Garden. Although Harry claims to represent ""all the big names... sooner or later,"" Bobby is not familiar with the agent. Nevertheless, he is impressed when Harry orchestrates a series of pratfalls among the wedding guests.Meanwhile, rock star Billy Wayne (Robert Desiderio) panics when he realizes his seven-year contract with the Harry the Devil expires at midnight.At Astral Records, Bobby and his longtime talent agent, Charlie Gray (Eugene Roche), arrive for an appointment with executive, Gary Frantz (Ron Silver). As they wait in the reception room, Harry arrives and forces Bobby to decide between the two agents. Bobby takes a chance on the determined elderly man and fires Charlie. When Harry proposes a $3.5 million recording deal for Bobby, Frantz and his colleague laugh. At the same time, Harry hands Bobby a seven-year representation contract. When the young musician hesitates, Harry agrees to a trial period and extends the contract to 12 years. As soon as Bobby signs, Harry magically changes the name on the signature line to ""Billy Wayne,"" and Frantz suddenly agrees to the million-dollar contract with the famous rock star. Although Bobby still feels like himself, everyone else now recognizes him as celebrity Billy Wayne. Meanwhile the real Billy Wayne has been transferred to Bobby's body, without any awareness of his former life.When Bobby telephones his wife to tell her the good news about the recording contract, he realizes another man has replaced him and that Wendy is also unaware of the switch. By now Bobby has surmised that his deal with Harry was a deal with the Devil, who reveals after the meeting that he lied about the trial period. During his first concert, Bobby is initially hesitant in front of screaming fans, but soon becomes more comfortable on stage. As the tour continues, he relishes the experience of being a rock star with a private plane, female groupies and magazine cover photos.Back in Los Angeles, however, Bobby arrives by helicopter at his hillside estate and is surprised that he still feels like his former self rather than a celebrity. He stops outside the loft apartment he shared with Wendy and appears regretful.Five months later, Harry visits Bobby again and mentions that God has become a bitter man, who rarely makes personal appearances on Earth. That night, Bobby is stunned to find out that Wendy is pregnant, but is relieved the child was conceived before the deal with the Devil was made. Desperate to return to his wife, Bobby begs to be released from his contract, but the Devil refuses. When he consults a Catholic priest and a Jewish rabbi about the unholy arrangement with Harry O. Tophet, the two religious leaders consider the musician mentally disturbed.On the street, Bobby encounters a sidewalk preacher who simply tells him to look for God in the desert. With a sudden urge to visit Las Vegas, Nevada, Bobby tells Gary Frantz to book performances at Caesars Palace. After the first show, Bobby asks the casino operator to page ""the Lord"" for him. When God telephones the musician's suite, he reassures Bobby and mentions that he has been watching over him since 1960. However, the Almighty does not offer immediate help and hangs up.Waiting in his dressing room before the next show, Bobby attempts to free himself from Billy Wayne's life by committing suicide. He swallows a handful of pills with liquor. Meanwhile in the casino, God and the Devil meet face-to-face for the first time and play poker together for the soul of Bobby Shelton. If the Devil wins, Bobby Shelton will die as Billy Wayne and be remembered with other fallen rock stars, such as Jim Morrison and Elvis Presley. During the play, God raises the stakes and wagers the millions of souls he is currently watching over. If he wins, the Devil will never be allowed to interfere in their lives, even if a person directly asks for him. The stakes are too risky for the Devil and he folds, conceding Bobby's soul. As God presents his weak card hand, the Devil realizes his opponent was bluffing.In the dressing room, Gary Frantz finds Billy Wayne's body unresponsive on the floor, while Bobby Shelton rises and slips out of the room. After a doctor declares Billy dead, Bobby finally feels released from the rock star's life.A wise-cracking, elderly God, who bears a strong resemblance to Harry the Devil, presents himself to Bobby and explains that he promised to look after Bobby when he had scarlet fever as child, adding that Arthur Shelton's prayer for his son was very convincing. God orders Bobby to go back to his wife. Unaware that her actual husband has been away for the past few months, Wendy welcomes Bobby home that evening. He tells her he has had a life-changing experience.Five years later, Bobby rushes to the bedside of his sick daughter and sings to her. Suddenly, Bobby hears the voice of God reassuring him."

He borrows a certain book, The Never ending Story, and reads it in the school attic. He soon finds himself immersed in a fantastical world.—grantss An unhappy boy is bullied by older youths and seeks sanctuary in a bookstore. The owner gives him a magic book in which he is able to follow the adventures of a boy who is everything he believe he is not, brave, strong, successful. He begins to understand that he is a part of the story and that the survival of the world about which he has been reading is in part up to him.—John Vogel <jlvogel@comcast.net> Young 10-year-old Bastian Balthazar Bux (Barret Oliver) prepares for another day of school one morning. He shares a tense conversation with his father (Gerald McRaney) about how he dreamed of his mother (assumed to have passed away due to illness). Bastian's father, who has not gotten over the tragedy himself, merely notes that it seems Bastian has allowed his mind to stray and brings up the fact that he received a letter from Bastian's teacher about how he was drawing horses in his math book. ""Unicorns,"" corrects Bastian under his breath, but his father continues, noting that Bastian did not try out for the swim team. Bastian tries to explain that he wanted horseback riding lessons instead but his father retorts that Bastian is too afraid to even get on one, much less ride it. His father then leaves for work, telling his son that he needs to 'keep his feet on the ground' and pay attention at school more.On the way to school, Bastian comes across some bullies from school (Chris Eastman,Darryl Cooksey, andNicholas Gilbert) who demand that he hand over his money. When Bastian produces none, they throw him into a garbage dumpster. Bastian eventually gets out but doesn't make it very far until he encounters them again. This time, they give chase but Bastian loses them by ducking into an old bookstore. The owner, Mr. Carl Conrad Coreander (Thomas Hill) scoffs at Bastian, thinking him to be another child interested only in arcade games and comic books but Bastian names all the real books he has read, including Treasure Island and The Lord of the Rings. His interest roused, Coleander strikes up a conversation and finds out that Bastian is hiding from some bullies. When asked why he doesn't stand up for himself, Bastian only shrugs. Bastian then notices the book Coleander is reading. The man explains that it is a special book, and quite dangerous, apart from the 'safe' books that Bastian is used to reading. He alludes to the fact that, while reading, a person may become immersed in the story to the point where he or she feels like they're living the tale, but there is always the guarantee that they can put the book down and return to reality. He informs Bastian that the book is not for him and sets it down before returning to his duties. Curious, Bastian takes the book, titled 'The Neverending Story', and leaves a note for Coreander, explaining that he will return the book later.Bastian arrives to school late and, when he sees that his class is busy taking a test, he goes up to the school's attic and finds quiet refuge. He settles in and begins to read:In a dark wooded area, two creatures known as Night Hob (Tilo Prückner) and Teeny Weeny (Deep Roy) have stopped to rest during an apparent journey. Suddenly, the sound of loud crashing is heard and a giant Rock Biter (Alan Oppenheimer) arrives on a rock-cycle. He tells the others about something indescribable that is destroying the realm where he comes from in the North. Night Hob and Teeny Weeny explain that they have both seen the effects of this strange 'Nothing' in their parts of Fantasia. The conversation then turns to how each of them has been sent by their people to seek help from the Childlike Empress. All three continue their journey together to the Ivory Tower, home of the Empress of Fantasia. Night Hob makes his way to the main floor of the structure where a man named Cairon (Moses Gunn) addresses the crowd who have come for answers as well. Cairon explains that the Empress is ill and that the Nothing, the force behind all the disturbances, may be responsible. However, a great warrior of the Plains People, named Atreyu, has been summoned, believed to hold the key to saving their world.Atreyu (Noah Hathaway) then steps forward and, to the surprise of Cairon and the assembly, is revealed to be a young boy. Cairon is unconvinced and claims that they summoned for 'Atreyu the Warrior', not 'Atreyu the Child'. Atreyu boldly answers that he is the only one known by this name and bravely accepts what quest the Empress has set for him. Cairon explains the Empress' request: Atreyu must find a cure for her and save their world from the Nothing. He is given the AURYN, a medallion comprised of two intertwining snakes, that will guide and protect him on his journey.Atreyu sets out across Fantasia on the back of his horse Artax. Unknown to him, a wolf-like creature emerges from its cave in another realm of the kingdom, and sets out after their trail. Atreyu and Artax search through a number of places but find no cure for the Empress. Eventually, they decide to go to the Swamps of Sadness to seek the advice of Morla, the ancient one. As they cross through the swamps, the sadness that lingers in this region takes hold of Artax who stops in his tracks and begins to sink into the bog. Though Atreyu tries to bring his horse back from sadness, Artax is consumed by the swamp, much to the heartbreak of both Atreyu and Bastian. Atreyu continues alone and soon finds a giant mound. As he approaches, the mound suddenly rises up and is revealed to be an enormous turtle, none other than Morla. The description as he reads it causes Bastian to cry out in shock and his shout is heard somehow by both Atreyu and Morla. Having spent so much time alone, Morla has taken to talking to himself and now refers to himself as 'we' instead of 'I'. Morla explains to Atreyu that he does not know how to save the Empress but tells him to seek the Southern Oracle. Atreyu's heart sinks when he hears the Oracle resides 10,000 miles away.As he trudges through the swamps, the sadness creeps up on Atreyu and he slowly begins to sink as the wolf-creature closes in on him. Then, a cloud-burst appears in the sky and a slim figure flies down and plucks Atreyu from the swamps just as he wolf-creature lunges forward. Atreyu later wakens to find himself cleansed and in the company of a white luck-dragon named Falkor (Alan Oppenheimer). Falkor explains that Atreyu spoke in his sleep, eventually revealing his name and his quest. Falkor has brought him 9,891 miles along his 10,000 mile journey to the Southern Oracle. Not far away is a small hovel where Atreyu is introduced to Engywook (Sydney Bromley) and Urgl (Patricia Hayes). Engywook has been studying the Southern Oracle for some time through a telescope and shows Atreyu the path through two gateways which will lead him there. The first gate is comprised of two giant sphinx statues. Atreyu learns that any man who feels his worth is permitted passage, but the sphinxes judge whomever comes before them and destroy any who feels a tinge of doubt. Atreyu watches as a mounted rider attempts to pass, but he is shot down by beams of fire shot from the sphinx's eyes. Atreyu goes forth to test his merit but becomes fearful when he sees the body of the rider. As the sphinx's eyes begin to open, Atreyu dodges forward, just missing the beams. Engywook is ecstatic that Atreyu has made it through but tells the others with warning that he must now pass through the Magic Mirrorgate, a large reflective gateway that shows a person what they truly are inside. Men have fled screaming from the sight of their inner selves.As he journeys from he first gate towards the second, Atreyu passes through a snowy landscape until he finds himself at the Mirrorgate. Looking into it, he is shocked to see a little boy sitting in a room reading a book. As Bastian reads this, he freaks out and throws the book away. After a moment of contemplation, he returns to continue reading.Atreyu is able to pass through the Mirrorgate and finally comes across the Southern Oracle (Tami Stronach), an object resembling the sphinxes with wings. A voice echoes from it and reveals what can be done to save the Childlike Empress; she must be given a new name. Atreyu is certain that he can do this but the Oracle informs him that it must be done by a human child and that they can only be found beyond the boundaries of Fantasia. The voice encourages Atreyu to hurry as its facade begins to crumble. Atreyu returns to Falkor and they go off in search of Fantasia's borders. However, they soon encounter the Nothing and Atreyu is knocked off Falkor's back. He awakens on an unknown shoreline and finds that he's lost the AURYN from around his neck. Desolate, he wanders the landscape until he encounters the Rock Biter who laments that his friends (Night Hob and Teeny Weeny) were taken from him by the Nothing. He mourns the fact that he was unable to protect them and now awaits the same fate.Atreyu then wanders into a cavern where he is surprised to see cave paintings that appear to have chronicled his journey so far. As he reaches near the end, he sees an image of a creature with green eyes and sharp fangs. Something stirs nearby and Atreyu leaves the cavern and comes face to face with the wolf-like creature, partially hidden in shadows. It greets Atreyu with hostility and claims that its name is Gmork (Alan Oppenheimer) before promising to make Atreyu its last victim. Atreyu promises not to be defeated as he is a warrior but Gmork scoffs when Atreyu admits he's not able to fight the Nothing since he can't find Fantasia's boundaries. Gmork reveals that Fantasia has no boundaries since its existence is shaped by the imagination of humans. Since humans have slowly given up on their imaginations and dreams, the Nothing has been consuming Fantasia. It admits that it is a servant of the Nothing, bent on gaining power and control, and was sent to kill the only person capable of stopping it; Atreyu. Angry, Atreyu reaches for a wooden shank and shouts that if he is to die, he will do so fighting. He then tempts Gmork to fight him, since he is Atreyu and the target of its search. Gmork lunges at him but Atreyu manages to kill it, stabbing it with the wooden shank.After he has done so, the force of 'The Nothing' finally begins to tear the land Atreyu is on apart. Atreyu clings to a tree, crying out for Falkor. Falkor has finally found Atreyu, as well as the AURYN, and saves him.The storm that Atreyu was caught in was the end of Fantasia, with nothing remaining of the land but small fragments floating in a black space. Atreyu sadly admits that he has failed, but wonders if the Ivory Tower might still exist. Using the AURYN, he requests that it lead the two of them to the Ivory Tower if it still stands. The AURYN does so, and the tower can be seen still in one piece, floating on a piece of land in the void.Atreyu ascends to meet the Childlike Empress, who asks why Atreyu is so sad. Atreyu claims he failed, but the empress says that he has brought the human child with him. The empress claims that Atreyu's journey was necessary for the human child to follow along with their adventures.Bastian cannot believe that they are talking about him, but the empress soon reveals revelations regarding the bullies that chased him, as well as the bookstore. Eventually, a large tremor shakes the tower, and Atreyu is injured. The empress pleads to Bastian through the book to say her name, as this will save her and their world.Bastian is torn, as he seems to be giving into a flight of fancy, rather than keeping his feet on the ground as he said he would do for his father. Finally, Bastian calls out the name for the empress ('Moonchild'), and the attic of the school goes black.Suddenly, the empress' voice rings in his ears, and Bastian finds himself face to face with her. In her outstretched hand, she holds a 'grain of sand,' the last remains of Fantasia. She entrusts this to Bastian, and says that through his imagination, Fantasia will live again, as long as he keeps wishing.Bastian then begins to wish, and finds himself on Falkor's back, flying through the landscape of Fantasia, seeing it returned to normal, including reuniting with Artax, alive and well. Falkor then asks Bastian what his next wish is. Bastian thinks, and the whispers into the giant dragon's ears, causing the creature to chuckle loudly.Back in the ordinary world, the bullies are shocked when Falkor and Bastian come flying down from the sky, chasing them down an alley.

A mysterious boy preacher, Isaac Chroner (John Franklin), arrives and takes all the children of Gatlin into a cornfield to speak to them about the prophecies of a demonic version of the Judeo-Christian God called ""He Who Walks Behind The Rows"".

Night of the Comet,1984,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087799/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A comet wipes out most of life on Earth, leaving two Valley Girls fighting against cannibal zombies and a sinister group of scientists. This often overlooked 80s film's about a pair of sisters, (one the quintessential 'valley girl'), who find themselves - along with a few others - as the sole survivors after a comet's wiped out all terrestrial life, it's funny, clever, well written and acted.—Jaime Kidwell Two sisters, high school seniors in the early 1980s, awaken one morning to blood red skies and the realization that the human race has been wiped out. This becomes apparent that anyone who was not surrounded by steel when Earth recently passed through the tail of a comet has been reduced to a pile of red dust (the trace elements of human chemical makeup). They encounter a friendly truck driver and take over the airwaves at a local radio station in an attempt to get help. Unfortunately, they attract the attention of a group of scientists who knew what the effects of the comet would be. They hide underground in a steel laboratory, but carelessly left the vents open. Now as various survivors of the comet who were only partially surrounded by steel are decaying into flesh-hungry zombies, the scientists are attempting to come up with a vaccine made of the blood of people who were not infected by the comet. Thus the trio must fight their way past not only roving packs of the cannibal zombies, but also outsmart a pack of scientists desperate not to become that way themselves.—Easter Bradford A comet, which has not passed by Earth for 65 million years, is again about to swing by the planet. Most people are partying, but a few are concerned that the Earth will be passing through the comet's tail. These include a team of scientists that enter a bunker in the desert just outside of the Los Angeles the night that the comet is to appear.That same night 18-year-old Regina Belmont (Catherine Mary Stewart) is working as a theater usher. Instead of going home after the last performance she calls her stepmom, Doris (Sharon Farrell) and tells her she will be out all night at the observatory with her science class. She really intends to spend the night with her semi-boyfriend, Larry (Michael Bowen), having sex in the steel-lined projection room. Larry, the projectionist, is waiting for someone to return a film he loaned them so they could make a pirated copy.Back at home Regina's outgoing 16-year-old cheerleader sister, Samantha (Kelli Maroney) gets in an argument with Doris accusing her of sleeping with a neighbor while her Sam's father is away with the military in Honduras. Doris decks Samantha and she runs away from the house.The next morning Larry and Regina awake to find that the film has not been returned. Larry intends to go and get it while Regina stays at the theater to let him back in. While she waits she plays an arcade game and manages to beat the score of some unknown person with initials ""DMK"", who had topped her previous high score.When Larry leaves the back of the theater he is attacked and killed by a zombie who drags him off to eat him.Regina goes looking for Larry and is surprised to see his motorcycle still sitting there. She is then attacked by the zombie, but her father has given her self-defense training and she is able to get away, jump on the motorcycle and take off.On the way home, Regina sees that there is no traffic on the roads and no people on the sidewalks. Only clothes and red dust. The sky is also a strange shade of red. She begins to realize that something bad has happened. On the street at her home she again sees that there is nothing around but empty clothes and red dust. She is surprised to find her sister is alive, however, still dressed in her cheerleader outfit from yesterday. Samantha, who doesn't realize that anything is wrong yet, tells Regina that she ran away last night, but remembered she didn't have any place to go, so she spent the night in the steel garden shed.Samantha has a hard time accepting that all the other people on Earth have been turned to dust by the comet. Regina speculates that the steel of the projection booth and the shed somehow protected them. The girls turn on the radio and find that the local station is still operating, so they jump in a car and head into the city to see if anyone is there.At the radio station, Regina and Samantha arrive where they find that the station is completely automated. They also find they have company, however; a man named Hector Gomez (Robert Beltran) appears pointing a revolver at them, and makes them stand in the lights of the room to see their faces in order to make sure they are not zombies. Hector tells them that he is a truck driver who spent the night in the back of his steel trailer with a teenage girl that he picked up hitchhiking yesterday afternoon. He further tells the story that he and the nameless hitchhiking teen girl arrived in the city that morning and saw it was deserted. They drove around looking for a gas station to fill up his truck when after arriving at one and getting out of the truck to look around for anyone, they spotted one of the zombies in the back of the garage building apparently eating a live cat that it fished out of a steel garbage dumpster behind the garage. Hector then claims that the girl panicked from the sight, ran off and was killed and eaten (off-camera) by some of the zombies. Hector has also came to the radio station to see if anyone survived.While Hector and Regina talk about Regina's friend apparently getting killed by the zombies, Samantha gets on the air and asks anyone who is still alive to phone the station. She soon gets a call from a group of scientists at an underground bunker. They advise her that the comet has caused most of the population to turn to dust. People who only got partial exposure will turn to zombies before they succumb to the same fate. They tell her to stay where she is and they will send a rescue team to come and rescue them tomorrow.Hector stays for that night but tells Regina that he needs to go to his parent's house in San Diego to see if they survived. He promises he will return.At the underground bunker, Carter (Geoffrey Lewis), the lead scientist, argues with Audrey (Mary Woronov) the head doctor. She complains that they should not be bringing outsiders into the bunker. Carter replies that under the circumstances they do not have a choice. As they watch a helicopter arrives carrying two survivors, an elementary age boy and girl both wearing pajamas.Samantha and Regina raid local military armory to get some automatic weapons to defend themselves (Luckily their father also taught them how to shoot). Samantha is depressed as it seems that Regina has already locked up the affections of only available man on the planet, Hector. Samantha has also developed a rash, something that occurs every time she feels stressed. To cheer her up Regina suggests they go shopping.At his parent's home, Hector confirms that his family is dead. He gathers a few keepsakes, but has to leave the house in a hurry when he is chased by a zombfied neighborhood boy. Reluctant to shoot at the zombie little boy, Hector manages to escape back in his truck and drives away.Back in Los Angeles, the girl arrive at a large department store and have some fun dressing up in fancy outfits they would never have been able to afford a few days before. Unfortunately they are being watched from the security cameras by a group of former stock boys who now feel they own the store. As the head stock boy taunts them from the PA, the others try to grab the girls. This leads to a gunfight. The boys finally capture Samantha, forcing Regina to surrender.Meanwhile, the scientists arrive at the radio station, but find it empty. On a hunch they decide to check the department store.In the basement the boys have chained the girls back-to-back. The head stock boy removes his sunglasses and we see that the boys have been partially exposed and are turning to zombies. They play a game of Russian Roulette putting a gun to Samantha's forehead and pulling the trigger. If it fires the bullet will travel first through Sam's head and out, then through the back of Regina's skull, killing them both.Before the fatal bullet is fired, however, the boys are surprised by the arriving scientists who machine gun them down and rescue the girls. The scientists, seeing Samantha itching, assume she has been partly exposed. They do not tell her that, but have her wait with Audrey and another scientist, Oscar (John Achorn) for Hector's return while Regina is immediately flown back to the bunker.Audrey injects Samantha with something that causes her to go unconscious. Oscar believes that Audrey has put the girl down to spare her from becoming a zombie. The two argue and Audrey tells Oscar that she no longer wants to be a party to taking survivors back to the bunker. He draws his gun, but Audrey is faster with hers and kills him.Back at the bunker, Carter tries to question Regina, but she is being uncooperative. In another room we see two nurses with two adult males lying unconscious on tables. They discuss how the survivors are being brought to the bunker so they can be used as a source of uncontaminated blood. To make them produce as much blood as possible they are operated on and made brain dead so they simply become blood making machines. The nurses note that they can get 300cc per day out of the men, but expect that the children will produce much less. They note that Regina, being a young and healthy teenager, should produce a large about of blood.Hector arrives back at the radio station to find Audrey, who is now very close to going zombie. While she injects herself with a lethal dose of drugs, she explains that the scientists accidentally left the vents open on the bunker and received a partial exposure. They are tracking down survivors hoping that if they can get enough uncontaminated blood they can create a serum to reverse the effect.At the bunker Regina demands to know where her sister is. Carter, who is starting to turn, tells her that Samantha has been euthanize before she could become a zombie. Regina is taken by guards to the medical area to prepare her for becoming a blood donor.Samantha is fine as Audrey only gave her a sedative. She and Hector arrive at the bunker and Hector knocks out the guard and rigs the trucks parked outside, while Samantha sneaks inside. She finds Regina and they are able to rescue the kids from the nurses just before they were about to start operating. Regina, Samantha and the kids escape and run to the car where Hector is waiting. The scientists attempt to pursue them in the trucks, but Hector has sabotaged them and they blow up.Back in L.A. the rain has washed away the last of the dust and the sky has cleared. Hector, Regina and the two kids have become a family unit. Regina is taking pictures of the them dressed in new clothes. Samantha, dressed like she ready to go to the beach, waits for them, apparently feeling left out. Mocking her sister for not letting the children cross against the stoplight in the deserted city, Samantha is nearly run over herself by a racing sports car. It is driven by a handsome teenager who apologies and tells her his name is Danny Mason Keener (Marc Poppel). He invites her for a ride and Samantha is delighted to find a boy her age. As they drive off we see his license plate reads ""DMK."" The credits roll."
The Ice Pirates,1984,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087451/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"In a distant future scarce of water, space pirates get caught after stealing ice from a spaceship. They are sold to a princess looking for her dad. He might have found a planet abundant with water. In the far future water is the most valuable substance. Two space pirates are captured, sold to a princess, and recruited to help her find her father who disappeared when he found information dangerous to the rulers. A real Space Opera with sword fights, explosions, fighting robots, monsters, bar fights and time warps.—John Vogel <jlvogel@comcast.net> In the future, water is the most valuable good in the future. Planet Mithra retains the possession of water and is powerful with their Templars warriors. The ice pirate Jason and his crew decide to steal water from a government fleet and Jason stumbles upon Princess Karina and he decides to kidnap her. Soon he is attacked by the government fleet, but Jason and his friend Roscoe are spared from castration by Karina and soon they learn that she wants to seek out her father that have found the Seventh Planet plenty of water.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil In a distant galaxy, where water is a valuable commodity, a band of space pirates board an imperial cruiser to steal ice. Jason (Robert Urich), the pirate leader, stumbles upon the quarters of Princess Karina of Argon (Mary Crosby), who is in a state of induced sleep. After battling the Templars royal guard, Jason kidnaps the princess and the Imperial cruiser pursues them. Jason orders two crew members, Zeno (Ron Perlman) and Maida (Anjelica Huston), to leave in escape pods just before the pirate ship is captured by Imperial forces.Zorn (Jeremy West), leader of the Templars, imprisons Jason and his robotics expert, Roscoe (Michael D. Roberts). As the prisoners are transported to the planet Mithra, the only remaining source of water in the galaxy, they learn that their sentence is to be ""redesigned,"" or castrated, and sold as slaves. Killjoy (John Matuszak), a thief, points out that members of the clergy are spared because the Templars fear God.Upon arriving on Mithra, Jason learns from another prisoner that Princess Karina is the daughter of Count Vasco, an explorer who disappeared searching for the possibly mythical Seventh World. Killjoy, impersonating a monk, is released, before Jason, Roscoe, and the other prisoners are strapped to a conveyor belt, shaved, and prepped for castration. As Jason and Roscoe pass through the final stage of the assembly line, Princess Karina secretly spares them. The men are outfitted in white wigs and leotards and sold to the highest bidder. Princess Karina purchases them and puts them to work at a party, where they encounter Killjoy, now disguised as a robot.Later, Karina asks Jason to help her escape to the pirate moon, Zagora, where she has urgent business. Jason, Roscoe, Karina, and Killjoy, flee the party on a motorcycle, with the Templars in pursuit. The group commandeers a warship, Karina is reunited with her Nanny (Natalie Core), and Jason plots a course for Zagora. Karina orders Jason to arrange a meeting with a rebel named Lanky Nibs (Robert Symonds). When Jason balks at Karina's plan to buy Lanky Nibs' services with the water on the ship, she demonstrates her seriousness and he bends to her will.Meanwhile, on Mithra, Zorn reveals to the Supreme Commander (John Carradine) that Karina and the pirates are aboard the warship, just as he planned. On board the warship, a small creature hatches from a dehydrated egg and bites Roscoe and Jason. From the ship's manifest, they learn the creature is a ""space herpe.""On Zagora, the pirates reunite with Zeno and Maida, and learn that Lanky Nibs is hiding in Sweetwater, fifty miles outside of town. Jason and Karina convince Frog Lady (Marcia Lewis) to take them to Sweetwater in her land cruiser. Jason is shocked by Lanky Nibs' appearance, and Lanky explains he aged twenty years in a time warp. He warns Jason that he was probably followed. Lanky recognizes Karina and informs her that her father, Vasco, found the Seventh World in the center of the galaxy, but the Templars ambushed his ship and slaughtered his crew. If Vasco is still alive, an exiled royal named Wendon is holding him captive in the Tri System.Later, a group of bounty hunters arrive and destroy the land cruiser, killing Frog Lady. A pursuit ensues and Jason kills the bounty hunters, but Lanky is badly wounded. Before dying, he pleads with Jason to find the Seventh World. After returning to the warship, Jason and his crew set off for the Tri System.On Wendon's planet, woman warriors riding unicorns capture everyone but Roscoe. In chambers, the pirates learn Wendon (Bruce Vilanch) is just a head with a robotic body. Roscoe enters to save his comrades, and they force Wendon to reveal where he is holding Vasco. However, the being who appears to be Vasco turns out to be a robot. A clue in the robot's programming leads Karina to a hologram recording of her father. Vasco gives coordinates to the location of the Seventh World, but warns that any deviation from the course will trap the ship in a time warp forever. During the voyage, Jason visits Karina in her quarters and they make love.A Templar battleship intercepts the warship as it passes through the time warp and Zorn makes video contact, informing Karina that she has done exactly what he had hoped: led them to her father and the Seventh World. The battleship captures the warship and a conflict between the Templar robots and the pirate robots ensues. Meanwhile, time accelerates and the princess learns she is pregnant. By the time he reaches Karina's quarters (in 10 minutes), she has given birth to Jason's son. As the pirates battle the Templar guards, time continues to accelerate and the humans age. The baby, also named Jason, becomes a little boy, and Nanny dies. As the pirates grow beards and become elderly, they are over-matched by Zorn's endless supply of robots. However, just as Jason and Roscoe lose hope, young Jason, now an adult, swoops in to defeat the Templars.As young Jason embraces his aged parents, the warship exits the time warp and everything returns to the moment when the acceleration started. The Templar battleship was one degree off course, however, and is now lost forever. The Seventh World comes into view and three-fourths of its surface appears to be covered by water and the crew celebrates; it is planet Earth. Jason, Karina, and the crew celebrate their victory, but the pirates realize they need to find a means of support."
Tank,1984,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088224/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Sergeant Major Zack arrives at a new army base with his wife, son and Sherman tank. One night at a bar he ""stops"" a pimp/deputy from beating a girl. The corrupt sheriff uses Zack's son for revenge and Zack uses his tank. Sergeant Major Zak Carey is serving what is his final tour of duty at an Army base in Clemens, Georgia. Zak doesn't like the way the Army keeps the base and the bar is not what he's accustomed to. So he goes off base to get a beer. When he goes to the bar one of the local prostitutes tries to come on to Zak but Zak turns her down. That's when the deputy who appears to be her pimp beating her up. That's when Zak strikes him. Later he learns that the Sheriff is corrupt and takes what happened to the Deputy as an attack on him and tries to get Zak but the Army backs him and Zak is not intimidated. That's when they arrest his son on trumped up drug charges. Before Zak can fix it, his wife tries to get a lawyer for their son but this only pushes the Sheriff to send their son to a prison farm. With no other recourse Zak gets into his own vintage Sherman Tank and busts his son out and they try to make it to the state line so that they can expose the Sheriff.—rcs0411@yahoo.com Zack is a Command Sergeant Major assigned to his last post before leaving the service. He is a colorful character and even on has his own WWII vintage tank that is used for parades and such. After he stops a deputy from beating a call girl, he finds that he is a marked man in town. The sheriff arrests his son on a trumped up drug charge. When all else fails, Zack uses his tank to even the odds.—John Vogel <jlvogel@comcast.net> Sergeant Major Zack Carey (James Garner) arrives at his last duty post, an Army base in Georgia called Fort Clemons, with his wife Ladonna (Shirley Jones) and his son Billy (C. Thomas Howell). The guard at the main gate welcomes him as he enters with his family in a station wagon. Behind him is a moving van with their belongings and a World War II Sherman tank on a trailer (he tells the guard he never said he travelled light). Personnel help him remove the tarps from his prized possession as Ladonna supervises the moving of furnishings into their on-base housing. As Zack rolls the tank onto solid ground, a staff sergeant reporter from Soldier Magazine named Jerry Elliott (Mark Herrier) interviews him, as he is the only Army man who owns a tank. He has restored it over fifteen years, adding a radio and PA system so he can drive it in parades and other events. Of his two sons, his eldest son Jonathan has died and Billy, born six years later, is just 16. When asked why anybody would want to own a tank, he replies that it is very hard to shoot yourself while cleaning it.Zack visits the base commander, Major General V.E. Hubik (Sandy Ward), who is familiar with him, welcomes him wholeheartedly and takes him on a tour of the base. Zack has made an offer on a fishing boat on which he and his wife can enjoy retirement. The General says Zack could be the next senior Sergeant Major of the Army and work out of the Pentagon, but Zack says he has only one son left who will go on his own soon, and he doesn't want to miss any quality time with him. Back at the house Elliott the reporter asks Billy what his father is like, and Billy says he is a cross between George Patton and Danny Thomas.Ladonna recommends that Zack goes to the local NCO club and he finds its more like a disco, geared to a younger crowd and much too noisy for his tastes. He does run into an old friend, Ed Tippett (Dorian Harewood) who works at the base Provost Marshall's office. When Ed says to come meet the wife, Zack says he knows Linda and Ed corrects him: Gwen is the new wife. At home Zack is slightly disheartened and talks to Ladonna about the club and his friend's divorce, saying all he wants to do is finish his duty and get on the boat, then the couple share a cuddle.At his first assembly with his command personnel the next morning, Zack stresses taking care of their own without problems reaching their superiors, and keeping to Army regulations in all matters. He also says he wants to see a proper bar on the base so Army personnel of a certain age don't have to dance, as he calls it, the funky monkey. Early the next morning Zack hits the battalion field to do his morning jog and shouts for all to hear that he finds himself alone; in moments the entire battalion has filed out of their barracks and they form ranks on the field to engage in early morning physical training with their sergeant major. The General is awakened by the sound of the troops passing. He watches Zack out his bedroom window and smiles.Sometime later, when Ladonna gets home, Zack happily announces that the sellers accepted their offer on the boat. He forgot she is entertaining the NCO wives in the house that night, so they can't eat dinner at home or celebrate yet. She suggests Zack go into town for dinner. He stops at the local bar, the Outpost Café, and talks with a woman named Sarah (Jenilee Harrison), who has aspirations to go to California and become a beautician. Zack becomes loose with the beer, says he has been in the Army for 30 years and jokes that he should go into the Navy now that he is a boat owner. He starts singing a loud shanty which interrupts a pool game being played by Deputy Euclid Baker (James Cromwell) and some of his friends. Euclid quickly makes it obvious to Zack that the Army isn't particularly welcome. He then tells Sarah she has wasted too much time on Zack and should be turning tricks with paying customers, then he slaps her. Zack says that the display was not necessary, but Euclid takes another swing at Sarah. Zack punches and roughs up Euclid, then gets hold of the deputy's service pistol; the bar patrons step back in alarm, but he simply drops it in the fish tank on the bar and leaves. Sarah yells at him that she could have lost her job, but he says a simple thank you would have sufficed. He immediately goes to Ed's house to tell him what happened, knowing he has made a mistake which will bring the local constabulary looking for him. Ed says the sheriff is a particularly mean variety of Georgian cracker, and it might take considerable money to get out of the situation.The next morning Euclid greets the sheriff, Cyrus Buelton (G. D. Spradlin) and brings his morning cup of coffee. Buelton upbraids Euclid for getting beaten up by somebody and not putting that person in jail. A mark on the deputy is a mark on him, and something he won't tolerate.Zack is spotted eating at the enlisted mess hall instead of the NCO mess, ruffling the feathers of Mess Master Sergeant Johnson (John Hancock), to whom it appears to be an unannounced inspection and a breach of etiquette. He storms over to Zack in a huff, but Zack explains he chose to come in because the food smelled good. He praises the clean facility, the quality of the food and that nobody slopped food onto the plates, all of which Johnson says is no less than he expects of his staff. When Zack gives high praise to the mess sergeant's own apple cobbler, the man softens and Zack earns his respect.Buelton and Euclid visit Sarah in her trailer. The sheriff awakens her and asks if she believes in Wonder Woman or the Lone Ranger. When she seems confused, he talks to her about thinking that Zack and Army men like him are her heroes. He demands that she roll over and drop her pants so he can enforce the lesson with his belt that there is no Lone Ranger. She complies. When he sees Euclid looking down at her and smirking, he whacks him upside the head before proceeding with Sarah's whipping, which she silently and tearlessly endures. The sheriff then visits the Provost Marshall's office. Ed has expected his arrival and excuses the white clerk at the counter to take on the visitor himself. Buelton says he wants Zack in his own jail and demands he be handed over. Ed casually says he will have him delivered at once, but doesn't move. Buelton challenges Ed and calls him Sambo. Ed says he will also order that by five o'clock the town be off limits to all military personnel to prevent more problems, knowing it would affect the town's livelihood. Ed then warns the sheriff, calling him Jim (as in Crow), not to exceed the speed limit leaving the base or risk spending time in his jail. Insulted, Buelton returns to his office and demands Euclid get every piece of information available on Zack.At a visit to the post hospital Zack sees a crying five-year-old boy being held down by his mother while a doctor stitches cuts to his bloodied face. The mother says his daddy isn't mad at him anymore, and Zack realizes what has happened. He calls the kid's Army father, Corporal Harris (Larry Jordan), into his office and asks if he hit his son. The man becomes defensive and says it is none of his business, but Zack makes it his business, offering to spar with him at the base gym if he feels the need to vent anger, and demands he get counseling. Harris continues to be stubborn, so Zack puts him against the wall and warns that he will visit the hospital daily to make sure the man doesn't lay another hand on the boy, threatening to risk his rank, retirement and the stockade if necessary to stop him, and the chastened man is dismissed.Zack and Billy talk about the boat at home, and Billy mentions naming it the Johnny Boy, saying it would be fitting since Johnny was his favorite son. Zack sets him straight, saying he and his mother had a different and unique relationship with Johnny, who always tried to prove himself (which might have been what had gotten him killed). Billy should never feel that Ladonna or he loved either of them more or less than the other. At school Billy is summoned to his locker. Euclid and Sherriff Buelton ask him to open his locker, but he finds a different lock on it and his combination doesn't work. On orders, the maintenance man breaks off the lock, and a bag of marijuana has been planted inside. Zack contritely visits the jail to see Buelton, and he and Euclid take great joy in humiliating him as he admits his fault and asks what he needs to do to get Billy back. Buelton says that the judge, who happens to be his brother-in-law, will surely send Billy to the county farm for two or three years of hard labor. The sheriff takes Zack on a tour of one of the work farms and has a supervisor pull a black worker off a truck, where he was on break from the work detail, to exercise negative feedback, which consists of beating the man for malingering. Buelton demands $10,000, which he feels Zack can afford after getting word of the article in the magazine. He also warns not to bring in any lawyers. Zack says he will play it his way as long as Billy is safe. He visits his son in jail and tells Billy that Buelton is getting revenge, he will be set free soon and to stay strong. Billy calls his dad sir, and Zack stresses to Billy that he should be as polite to his captors.Back at home Ladonna slaps Zack, furious at him for ""whoring"" and putting their son in danger. She refuses to listen and says she wants to get a lawyer and bypass any of his ideas. The next day, while Zack is conducting a firearms inspection, Ladonna pulls up in the car and confesses that she had no idea what kind of man Buelton was. At the sheriff's office, Zack quietly hands Buelton the money in a bag, which the sheriff says will keep Billy alive for a while, and Zack argues additional shakedowns had not been part of their deal. The sheriff says hiring the lawyer was dumb. Billy has been tried and sentenced to three years of hard labor at the work farm where, without protection, he might be victimized by degenerates or shot while trying to escape. In the jail cell, Billy has suffered a beating and yells at his father, as he has been told a version of what happened with Sarah at the bar, asking if she was worth it. Zack goes home and thinks things over, weighing his options. At dawn he goes to his tank, prepares the vehicle and then drives it toward the main gate. Major General Hubik is apprised of the situation, and he tells the guards to bar the gate. Zack simply swerves past them, taking down part of the fence as he heads into town.Zack awakens Euclid at the jail with his tank and trains the muzzle on him, asking him to let his son out of jail. Euclid says Billy was taken to the county farm overnight as a precaution, and only a couple of drunks are inside. Sarah has come out of her trailer and says the lawyer they hired is also in the jail. Zack has her retrieve Euclids keys to release the prisoners, then tells him to take the radio out of the squad car. Euclid refuses, saying it's a new radio and the sheriff would kill him if it got ruined, so Zack uses the main gun on the tank to take out the squad car. Then he shoots the main phone line out of town with a machine gun. He drives through the jail using his tank as a juggernaut to level the building. Finally he has Euclid strip naked and Sarah handcuffs him to a telephone pole. She asks Zack to take her with him, as she can't stay there anymore, and he agrees.Outside the work farm, they observe Billy through binoculars, helping a work crew. Zack blasts a truck as a diversion and uses the sound system in the tank to tell Billy to lie down flat; he aligns the tracks vertically on either side of Billy and drives the tank over his son to retrieve him using the hatch in the floor, and the trio take off. The police are called in to block the road, but Zack drives the tank over the squad cars. Buelton talks to the governor of Georgia (Wallace Wilkinson) saying he has a 52-year-old sergeant major who is crazy, along with a sixteen-year-old ""dope fiend"" and a 20-year-old hooker in a Sherman tank, and asks for help, but he refers the sheriff to the Army.Billy helps Zack with tank maintenance while Sarah washes in the river. He has a disagreement with his father because of Sarah's presence, but Zack says she is willing to testify how she was arrested for vagrancy and forced into prostitution by Buelton on a trumped-up charge, lending weight to their cause, and Zack can then add his testimony as well. He tells Billy they're not running from, but to, the law, hoping to go over the state line, where true authority in neighboring Tennessee can put a stop to Buelton's abuse of power.Buelton visits Hubik to demand aid from the military. Hubik replies the only indiscretion the Army has against Zack is his destruction of a 20-foot section of fence, and Zack had resigned earlier in the day. Then he mentions the Posse Comitatus Act, a law prohibiting the Army rendering aid in a civilian matter without the permission of their Commander in Chief: the President of the United States. The sheriff, unfamiliar with the term, misinterprets it and takes umbrage, thinking he has been called a ""pussy communist,"" and storms off to deal with Zack in his own way.The news media has received word of the fugitives in the tank. Buelton puts his men at every gas station to the state line to stop Zach from refueling. When the tank begins to run out of gas, they pull up to some gas pumps at an off-road home. When Zack restrains the owner, he is surprised when Mr. Gant (Danny Nelson) doesn't protest. He says Zack can have anything he wants, as his sister's son was sent to the work farm and never got out. After a quick rest and a meal, they continue on their way. Buelton speaks to his supporters about Gant abetting a felon. Folks appear at the property with torches to burn the home down and have him serve as a lesson to others. He stands up to them, and suddenly the tank appears. Zack has doubled back to help Gant and drives the mob off.As they take on supplies from Mr. Gant, Billy works with Sarah. He has been cool toward her until finally she sets him straight. Zack only wanted to talk, she says, and if he had taken her back to the trailer to cheat on Ladonna, as most men shes known has, the events would have played out differently. Billy realizes Zack did nothing wrong and gains a new understanding of his father. Meanwhile Gant helps Zack plan his trip to the Tennessee border, suggesting a rougher route which will take them away from a bog where Buelton suspects he may be headed.The tank slips a track as they detour through some rough country, and Zack and Billy work on it together. Billy mans the tank to move it forward when his dad gives the word to Sarah, but Zack mumbles to himself while readying the tank to reset the track, Sarah mishears him as giving the okay and signals Billy to move the tank. The tank jerks and Zack takes a blow from a crowbar to the torso, causing immediate pain. He says his ribs are broken, and later he starts coughing up blood. It becomes apparent that he has internal bleeding, and they need to reach the state line and help soon. Billy says he can handle the tank, as he helped build it. When Zack protests that Billy doesnt have to prove anything like Johnny used to, Billy says he is not like his brother, but more practical like his mother. He realizes his dad took the blame for something that was not his fault. Billy decides to go flat out toward the border rather than moving only by night, to get them out of danger faster.Ladonna talks to Billy and Zack via the military radio and apologizes to her husband for what she said to him. Then she goes to the governor of Tennessee for help, but at first he refuses to see her. She talks to the television news reporter, asking the wives watching to call the governor if they support her cause and ask that he give her five minutes of his time. A helicopter carrying a newsman hovers over the tank while broadcasting on live television, and he interviews Billy through the tanks radio. Billy tells the people that he loves and respects his dad and has no intention of giving Zack over to Buelton. Watching the show is a gang of bikers at a bar who admire Billy and his old man.With the public's outcry, the governor finally gives in and talks to Ladonna in his office. If Zack can cross the state line, she wants the governors promise that a fair trial can be held there instead of in Buelton's jurisdiction. The governor has issues because one of the fugitives is an alleged prostitute, and Ladonna says that it is her own husband and son with the alleged 20-year-old prostitute, and he should have no problem with the matter if she doesn't. She then mentions that she has reporters and his own voters outside waiting for her to deliver his answer, suggesting that he should consider if he will be perceived as a man who wants to see justice done, or as an asshole. He asks if she is threatening him with blackmail, and she brazenly says she is. He agrees to help Zack if the tank arrives, promising in a television interview that there will be a hearing in his state before any extradition is considered.Buelton gets his own supporters together to force the tank, with the aid of roadblocks, to detour into a recessed open field by the side of the only road leading to the state line. The plan is to stall the tank there with mud, and water tanker trucks begin hosing down the dirt in the field as the semis to block the highway are put in place. He has a man named Avery (Don Young) set up a bazooka to fire rounds at the tank when it arrives to ensure it is disabled. At the crossroad on the other side of the border, hundreds of Zack's supporters, who have watched the story play out on television, come to help in any way they can, along with television crews and helicopters. The bikers have also set up to await their arrival. Ladonna gets on the radio to the tank and tells her family and Sarah that they have won.Buelton and his crew hide at the edge of the road with their guns. As the tank approaches the border and he sees the way blocked, Billy steers the tank off the road as expected and starts across the muddy field. Avery fires the bazooka but misses, since he hasn't used the weapon since his own military days, but his second shot hits the tank, and it shuts down. Buelton announces that they can all wait while the climbing temperatures take their toll on the tank's occupants. The general arrives by military helicopter to join Ladonna. When he says the tank has slipped a track and will only move if it is pulled out, the bikers confer on what to do, then they start to unload supplies off a parked truck. When the driver asks what they're doing, they openly reply, ""Stealing,"" to no objection; everybody pitches in to build what turns out to be a ramp. Billy finally goes over the PA to ask about how his father will be treated if they surrender, as Zack is feeling worse due to his injuries. Buelton gives his word that Zack will go to the hospital immediately. Then a biker rides out on the completed ramp, sailing through the air on his motorcycle carrying a rope to be attached to a tow cable that can help pull the tank out of the mud. Billy exits the tank from the bottom hatch and helps attach the cable while Sarah holds Buelton's gunmen at bay with the machine gun.Everybody, with Hubik and the Tennessee Governor on hand, begins to pull on the cable. Buelton tries to instruct his aides to shoot into the crowd, but the armed troopers on the Tennessee side take aim and warn that there will be another Little Big Horn if they do that, so they run into the field and pull from the rear of the tank, which isn't budging. Buelton jumps onto the tank to demand Zack come out, but Sarah turns the turret to knock the sheriff to the ground. The crowd spots a bulldozer that can handle the cable. It is put into use, and along with pulling supporters against the meager crew on Buelton's side, the tank is slowly pulled up the incline, over the Georgia state line and into Tennessee. The sheriff and Euclid are left in the mud. Ladonna embraces Zack and Billy as they exit the tank, and Billy kisses Sarah as the crowd cheers."

Dreamscape,1984,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087175/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A man who can enter and manipulate people's dreams is recruited by a government agency to help cure the President of the United States of his nightmares about nuclear war but stumbles upon an assassination plot. A government funded project looks into using psychics to enter people's dreams, with some mechanical help. When a subject dies in his sleep from a heart attack Alex Gardner becomes suspicious that another of the psychics is killing people in the dreams somehow and that is causing them to die in real life. He must find a way to stop the abuse of the power to enter dreams.—Zaphod <aaa@scs.leeds.ac.uk> Twenty-six year old Alex Gardner has psychic abilities. He was once in a psychic abilities scientific study under the leadership of Dr. Paul Novotny, but left the study seven years ago without a word or a trace, no longer wanting to live continually hooked up to electrical probes. Alex has since lived off his big winnings at the race track, his uncanny ability to pick the winners consistently which has come to the attention of some low life criminal elements who want a piece of his action. Dr. Novotny does locate Alex for the two to discuss his latest scientific breakthrough: dream therapy. Through electronic connections, he has discovered a way for psychics to be able to enter into the dreams, or as the case may be, nightmares of others, in order to treat the patients through or in dealing with the dreams/nightmares. The reasons for Alex agreeing to participate as one of the psychics are threefold: to get away from that criminal element at the track, they who are after him; a little moral suasion on Dr. Novotny's part; and Alex's attraction to Dr. Novotny's associate, Jane DeVries. The study is clandestinely supported by the government, the liaison for the government being Bob Blair, a personal friend to the President. As Alex begins to see the benefit to others in the work, he also begins to suspect that others involved in the study, namely a fellow psychic named Tommy Ray Glatman, and Blair himself, are working on their own agenda against the goals of the study. That alternate agenda may have something to do with the fact that the President himself has of late been suffering from recurring nightmares - something only his inner circle knows - which is now dictating his political agenda. If Alex comes close to discovering the truth of that agenda, his life, the lives of others in the study, and that of investigative writer Charlie Prince, who Alex befriends, may be in jeopardy.—Huggo"

Danny Rose is a manager of artists, and although he's not very successful, he nevertheless goes out of his way to help his acts. So when Lou Canova, a singer who has a chance of making a come-back, asks Danny to help him with a problem, Danny helps him. This problem is Lou's mistress Tina. Lou wants Tina to be at his concerts, otherwise he can't perform, but he's married, so Danny has to take her along as if she was his girlfriend. Danny however gets more than he has bargained for when two mobsters come looking for the guy who has hurt their brother by stealing the heart of Tina, the girl he loves.—Leon Wolters <wolters@strw.LeidenUniv.nl> At the Carnegie Deli in New York City, a group of comics are kvetching about their common professional lives. One of the more interesting topics of conversation centers on theatrical manager (aka talent agent) Danny Rose, who represents those who can't get better agents but who has always been committed to his clients. They talk most specifically about a rumored incident that took place approximately ten years ago, when Danny's most famous client was washed-up lounge singer Lou Canova, who had some minor fame in the 1950s and who was trying to make a comeback during an era when lounge singers were mostly seen as being hack performers. Despite being married with children, Lou was having an affair with brash blonde Tina Vitale, who Lou wanted at one of his performances. As such, Danny agreed to be a beard in being Tina's date. What Danny did not know was that Tina had casual mob ties, including her ex-husband being entrenched within the organization. Through no fault of Danny's own besides protecting his client Lou, Danny became the target of the mob.—Huggo Danny Rose (played by Woody Allen) is a theatrical agent. He has a wide and often odd assortment of clients but will do anything for them. One of his clients, Lou Canova (Nick Apollo Forte) - a washed up crooner from the 50s who is undergoing a resurgence, asks Danny to accompany his mistress, Tina (Mia Farrow), to one of his concerts - her presence helps him perform. Danny naturally obliges. However, Tina is also seeing a mob boss and when Danny is seen with her, the mob boss assumes Tina is two-timing him with Danny. This results in Danny and Tina being hunted by the mob. Adventures and hilarity ensue.—grantss In New York City, several veteran comedians bide their time at the Carnegie Deli, discussing the old days. Soon they are recalling theatrical agent, Broadway Danny Rose (Woody Allen), and his motley assortment of minor league talent, including a blind xylophone player, a one-legged tap dancer, a one-armed juggler, balloon folders, and a blonde-haired virtuoso of the water glasses. After trading stories about Danny's devotion to his clients, one of the comedians claims he has the greatest Broadway Danny Rose story, one involving Lou Canova (Nick Apollo Forte), a has-been, overweight Italian-American crooner with a big ego, a drinking problem and one hit song from the fifties.The comedian tells his story: Danny, who is devoted to his clients, attends Lou's nightclub performance and afterward is uneasy when the married Lou, who is saddled with alimony obligations from a previous marriage, purchases a single white rose from a flower shop for his mistress, Tina Vitale (Mia Farrow). Acquainted with Lou's wife Teresa (Sandy Richman) and their twelve-year-old daughter, Danny warns Lou against extra-marital affairs. The nostalgia craze has made it easier for Danny to book Lou on cruise ships and local television shows.When famous comedian, Milton Berle, tells Danny he is looking for talent for his nostalgia-themed television special and his Las Vegas opening act, Danny sees a chance for Lou to make a comeback and convinces Berle to attend Lou's upcoming performance at the Waldorf. As Lou exercises on a treadmill to shed pounds, Danny works almost exclusively with him to prepare his performance, at the expense of his other clients. When Lou insists that he needs Tina at the performance to give him confidence, Danny considers it unwise because Teresa will be there. However, Lou begs him to ""be the beard"" and pretend to be Tina's date, so that her presence will not arouse suspicion.On the day of the performance, Danny ventures outside his comfort zone of Manhattan to pick up Tina, and when he arrives at her apartment, he finds her screaming at Lou on the phone, accusing him of two-timing her with a ""cheap blonde"" at the racetrack. She refuses to go to the performance, but Danny takes the phone and assures Lou they will both be there. Trying to convince Tina that her suspicions are unwarranted, Danny follows her to the home of her fortuneteller, Angelina, who urges Tina to resolve all her relationship problems.Acting on Angelina's advice, Tina makes an hour-long drive to a large estate in the suburbs, where her family and others connected to a crime organization have gathered for a party. Intent on settling old affairs, Tina meets with her ex-boyfriend, Johnny Rispoli (Edwin Bordo), who is unwilling to accept that their relationship is over and who, by stalking her, has learned about the single white roses she receives daily from her current lover. Presuming Danny is her new love interest, Johnny calls him ""Danny White Roses,"" but Danny insists he is only a theatrical agent.While continuing to urge Tina to attend Lou's performance, Danny tells Tina how he has nurtured Lou's career, by picking out his clothes and teaching him to budget money, and developing the way Lou tosses the microphone during a performance. When Danny demurs that he is not a Cary Grant in the looks department, Tina says she likes intellectuals and that he is a smooth talker. She adds that Angelina predicted that she would marry a Jew or someone musical.When Johnny captures the attention of the crowd and claims that Danny seduced Tina away from him, Danny and Tina feel compelled to escape from the party in Danny's car. As they race away, Danny learns Tina's husband, an underworld debt collector, was murdered by the mob. Shortly after they leave the party, Johnny's mother declares a vendetta and sends her other sons, hit men Vito and Joe, after Danny.At a coffee shop, when Tina realizes they are being followed, she and Danny abandon the car and run through New Jersey flat lands to evade the brothers, and make their way to Manhattan by boat. On the other side of the Hudson, Tina makes a call and afterward warns Danny to lie low in a hotel for a few days. Balking, Danny insists he must get his pills and other items, so she accompanies him to his apartment. There, she suggests decorating ideas, such as a bamboo motif and zebra skins, to lighten up the dreary place. To support her ambition to be an interior decorator, Danny quotes his Uncle Morris, ""the famous diabetic from Brooklyn,"" on the importance of confidence. Tina then shares her philosophy, ""See what you want, go for it,"" adding that one should ""do it to the other guy 'cause if you don't he'll do it to you."" Danny says Tina's philosophy sounds like the screenplay to the film, Murder Inc. , and counters with the words of his Uncle Sidney, ""acceptance, forgiveness and love,"" which he calls a real philosophy of life.The Rispoli brothers eventually catch up and kidnap Danny and Tina and take them to a remote warehouse where floats and balloons for the Macy's Thanksgiving Day are stored. When the brothers threaten Danny with pistols, he protests that he is ""just a beard."" Under duress, Danny offers up the name Barney Dunn as the real lover, because he knows that Barney, the world's worst ventriloquist, was scheduled to perform on a cruise ship and is therefore far from danger.When Danny and Tina are left alone, tied face-to-face to each other, they manage to wriggle loose, but as they leave the warehouse, they must dodge bullets fired at them. When a bullet hits a helium truck used to inflate the Macy's balloons, both the hit man's threats and the intended victims' pleas for mercy sound like the voices of cartoon characters.After escaping, Danny and Tina take a cab back to the theater to find Lou drunk backstage. At Teresa's request, Danny makes his special concoction for counteracting drunkenness and, completely cured, Lou soon sings ""My Bambina"" from the Waldorf stage. In the audience, Danny shares a table with an approving Milton Berle and Howard Cosell, while another talent agent, Sid Bacharach, watches from another corner of the room. After his successful performance, Lou confesses to Danny that he is signing with Sid Bacharach and has Tina's approval. Danny later learns that the Rispoli brothers beat up Barney Dunn, so he offers to pay Barney's hospital bills. Tina moves in with Lou but finds she's having bad dreams, a case of ""bad conscience"" according to her fortuneteller. When Lou's success leads to television work in California, Tina refuses to accompany him.On Thanksgiving Day, Tina goes to Danny's apartment and finds him serving frozen turkey TV dinners to his guests, Barney Dunn and his longtime clients. Although she apologizes and reminds Danny of his Uncle Sidney's words of wisdom, ""acceptance, forgiveness, and love,"" Danny rejects her. However, he then pursues her down the city streets, past the Carnegie Deli, and takes her back to his place. In the present, the Carnegie Deli comedians comment on the ultimate achievement of Broadway Danny Rose, ""They named a sandwich after him--at this very deli."""

Davey takes the role playing a bit more seriously, where in real life he truly does believe he is being guided by Jack. He does so to overcome what he sees as his own recently widowed father, Air Force Staff Sergeant Hal Osborne, not being there for him, while in reality Hal is trying to manage their home life as best he can under their new circumstances.

His mother has recently died, leaving just him and his father, a military air traffic controller who has problems relating to his child. Davey is a lonely child and is still grieving over his mother, so he immerses himself in the fantasy world of Cloak & Dagger, an espionage game which exists in both role playing and video forms. Davey has one friend, Kim, (Christina Nigra) a girl who lives nearby with her single mother. Davey is interested in the world of espionage and his hero is the character Jack Flack from the game. He wants to live an action-packed life like Jack Flack and he carries around a water pistol as his ""gun"" and a softball as his ""grenade"".

This comes to a head when Davey is cornered by Rice along the River Walk.During the fight, Jack Flack urges Davey to set up the two spies into the ""Crossfire Gambit"", causing one to kill the other. Jack convinces Davey to pick up the gun of the dead spy, but rather than shoot Rice, Davey panics and runs away down a dead-end path. Rice arrives and corners Davey.

When Davey proves unable to shoot first, Jack Flack tries to get Rice's attention. Standing in front of a blank wall (and holding his Agent-X bulletproof beret in front of him for protection), Jack dares Rice to shoot him. Davey looks to Jack, warning him not to do anything, and Rice instinctively turns and fires a burst at the wall, thinking ""Jack"" is a hidden ally. An enraged Davey fires his pistol, killing Rice and causing him to fall dead into the river.Realizing that Jack had tricked him into shooting the spy, Davey throws away the pistol, pulls the miniature of Jack Flack out of his pocket and, with a shout of ""I don't want to play anymore!"" breaks the miniature in two, stomping it into the concrete. Jack Flack tells Davey his father behaved the same way at his age, growing tired of playing ""Cowboys and Indians"". As he speaks, blood begins to pour from the bullet holes that now riddle his body, and Jack abruptly collapses. While expressing regret about the rule, ""...leaving when they stop believing,"" Jack confesses Davey was always his favorite playmate. Distracting Davey by asking for a smoke, Jack fades away into nothing. When Davey calls to Jack, saying he can't do it alone, Jack's voice reassures him that he always could, and tells him to go save Kim.Earlier in a scene at the Alamo, Davey had been befriended by a kind elderly couple. Seemingly the only adults to believe him, or at least the only ones who are willing to humor his adventures, the couple turn out to be enforcers working for the spies. Davey manages to escape their clutches, but without the game cartridge, and he chases the couple to the airport where they are attempting to flee the country. At the airport, Davey forces the couple's hand by pretending that they are his parents and that they are abandoning him. When security attempts to intervene, Davey tells the guard the proof is the game cartridge he knows they have. Cornered, the couple kidnaps Davey at gunpoint and commandeers a plane, unaware that Davey has brought with him a bomb which the spies had meant to use to kill Kim. Unwilling to listen to Davey about the bomb, the couple requests a pilot. Meanwhile, Hal has arrived at the airport with Kim's mother, and after hearing about the hostage situation, he volunteers to be the pilot. As the plane moves to the runway, Davey tries to summon Jack for help; his father hears him and identifies himself as ""Jack Flack"" and calls Davey to the cockpit. When the female enforcer shows up to bring him, she discovers the bomb and panics, calling for her husband. As the two enforcers try to disable the bomb, Davey and his father manage to escape safely from the cockpit; the plane travels a short distance before exploding, killing the enforcers and incinerating the cartridge. The film ends with the two reunited and Davey insisting he no longer needs Jack Flack because he has his father."

He happens to meet Sam Bouchard, a fellow actor who needs a house sitter. Both are pleased with the arrangement that will have Jake staying in the house and for a sweetener, Sam shows him his favorite neighbor, a well-built woman who strips with her window open each night.

He becomes interested in the girl, infatuated even, following her around and eventually meeting her. She also has another admirer however and while watching her one night through his telescope, Jake sees her murdered by this other man. The police are skeptical about what he claims to have seen, but the case takes an even stranger twist when, while watching adult TV, he sees a porn star do the exact same dance he had watched for all those nights. He soon realizes he has been an unwitting accomplice in a complex plot.—garykmcd Los Angeles based actor Jake Scully is having a string of bad luck. He discovers while filming a scene in his current movie, an erotic vampire flick, that he is claustrophobic, debilitatingly so. Despite Jake's determination to work through the phobia not only for this movie but to cope in his everyday life, he is fired by the movie's director Rubin, who cannot afford the delay caused by Jake's issues. Jake also finds out by catching her in the act that his girlfriend Carol is cheating on him, he not even suspecting before that that there was a problem in their relationship. After moving out of Carol's apartment and crashing on his friend's couch for a few days, Jake, in what may be a turn in his fortunes, is offered a house-sitting gig by Sam Bouchard, a fellow actor he recently met. Sam had been sitting at this friend's luxury house in the Hollywood hills, but asks Jake to sit for him during an out-of-town run on a play in which he has been cast. Beyond the luxury of the house itself, it is an easy gig in that Jake can do whatever he wants at the house, his only task to water the plants to make sure they don't die. On top of the ease of the gig, Sam also informs Jake of a bonus in that a beautiful neighbor with long brunette hair across the valley, the interior of whose equally luxurious house can be seen through a telescope, performs a sensuous striptease every night at the same time. During the sit, Jake becomes obsessed with the brunette, first in a romantic sense because of the striptease, then later in a protective sense as he can see that there are some issues in her life. Those issues include a male in her life physically beating her, and a native American seemingly stalking her probably to rob her. Because of this specific voyeur activity, Jake is implicated in a murder investigation. A chance sighting of porn star Holly Body may give Jake some clues as to what happened in the murder, which is only further complicated by his claustrophobia.—Huggo Struggling L.A. actor Jake Scully is fired from his vampire B-movie part by fickle director Rubin and homeless after finding his girl friend in bed with another. he eagerly accepts an invitation to house-sit from fellow actor Sam Bouchard, whom he befriend over drinks in a bar, a luxury villa as Sam has got a job offer in Seattle. Its saucy perk is directing a telescope at a foxy woman undressing voluptuously like clockwork, but after Sam has gone, Jake sees her in danger. He starts inquiring, following abusive mobster-kept porn actress Holly and saves her from a dodgy robber or stalker, who still gets away with a card he stole from the purse Jake recovered for her. Jake now risk getting caught between the mobsters and investigating police detective Jim McLean.—KGF Vissers The film begins and ends with the protagonist, Jake Scully (Craig Wasson), playing the part of a vampire on the set of a low-budget horror film. After he ruins a take by being unable to rise from a coffin due to claustrophobia, a fire breaks out on the set and he is sent home by the director Rubin (Dennis Franz).Scully arrives home early and catches his girlfriend having sex with another man. Since it is the girl's apartment, he must leave, so without a place to stay he heads to an acting workshop, where he makes a new friend, Sam.Sam offers him a house-sitting arrangement at an opulent Modernist bachelor residence high atop the Hollywood Hills. He also points out a sexy female neighbor, Gloria Revelle (Deborah Shelton), whose seemingly exhibitionistic antics can be viewed by telescope; she is a wealthy and beautiful woman who evidently performs a remarkable erotic dance at her window, nightly according to Sam, ""just like clockwork.""Scully's nightly observations of this woman quickly lead him into a murder mystery. He follows Gloria one day and attempts to warn her that she's being stalked by an Indian with a disfigured face who could be a thief or worse. The mysterious Indian snatches Gloria's purse at the beach, is chased by Scully into a tunnel, and steals what is later discovered to be a card key to Gloria's house. In an ironic twist, Gloria ""rescues"" Scully by leading him from the tunnel in which he had frozen in a claustrophobic seizure during the pursuit. They briefly embrace, make out, and grope each other as the camera revolves in a continuous 360-degree arc, until Scully kisses her neck and Gloria comes to her senses, apologizes and pushes him away, adjusts her bra and blouse, and departs hastily.Back at the home he's using, Scully then becomes an eyewitness through the telescope as the young woman is brutally attacked and killed by the Indian, who pins her down and runs an electric drill the size of a jackhammer through her body - the auguring bit repeatedly emerges from the ceiling of the room below in a torrent of blood - after she catches him removing items from a wall safe.(That a purported thief would have and use with extreme deadly force such an implement leads viewers to suspect that perhaps the murder was of a personal nature as opposed to merely a bungled burglary.)Investigating on his own, Scully pursues a porn queen, Holly Body (Melanie Griffith), whose ""signature"" dance - ""a routine that's a sure ten on the peter meter"" according to her - he recognized on a 24-hour porn channel. A descent into her sordid world follows, in which he lands a role in an adult film in order to meet her and then pretends to be a skilled porn director who wants to hire her. He takes credit for a mirror (which inadvertently reflects the camera and crew as the door on which it is hung swings open during the scene).Their trail takes them back to the bachelor pad, where Scully confesses that he is not a porn producer and does not want to cast her in a film, but instead points out the Revelle house and asks her if she was the woman he had observed doing the erotic dance routines in the window. During a brief telephone call from Sam to Scully, Holly identifies the voice of Sam as the man who had hired her to perform specifically for the supposedly voyeuristic Scully. She storms out in a blustery huff and is picked up while hitchhiking by the Indian, who knocks her out with a tire iron.Scully follows them on foot, scaling a gate through which the pair was purported to have just passed (but which is curiously locked with a double chain), and arrives at an open grave adjacent to the Owens Aqueduct that the Indian has just finished digging. (It is not explained how the grave was dug so quickly.) During the confrontation between Scully and the Indian that follows, Scully grabs at the Indian's face, inadvertently removing what is actually a makeup facial cast, revealing that the Indian is actually Sam. Sam then overpowers Scully, tossing him into the grave. When Scully is again frozen from his claustrophobia, Sam begins to bury him as he confesses his scheme, which was to set Scully up as a witness to Gloria's murder by the ""Indian"" and give Sam an alibi.The film then cuts to the set of the vampire movie, where Scully (wearing the dirt-caked leather jacket from the aqueduct grave scene instead of the vampire costume and heavy makeup as before) again freezes during the coffin scene and ruins the take. This time, however, he convinces Rubin to let him try it again.Cutting back to the grave, we see Scully overcome his claustrophobia and attack Sam, who is knocked into the aqueduct when his dog charges at Scully and misses. The film ends with Scully, back on the set and in his vampire costume, filming a shower sequence in which a body double of his next victim is being carefully inserted into the scene, while Holly watches with the film crew."

The Bounty,1984,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086993/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Fed up with their Captain's harsh discipline, a sailing ship's crew decides to take action. The story of Lieutenant Bligh (Sir Anthony Hopkins), whose cruelty leads to a mutiny on his ship. Follows both the efforts of Fletcher Christian (Mel Gibson) to get his men beyond the reach of British retribution and the epic voyage of Lieutenant Bligh to get his loyalists safely to East Timor in a tiny lifeboat.—Reid Gagle During an expedition to Tahiti in the year of 1788 to gather breadfruit pods for commercial transplantation, a sailing ship's crew develop a taste for the easy pleasures that island life offers. Especially their luscious appetite for the topless native women puts a strain on the relationship with their commanding captain. When ship discipline becomes more and more problematic, Lieutenant William Bligh subjects the crew to the cruelty of corporal punishments. But when they return home, these tensions eventually reach breaking point and Acting Second Lieutenant Fletcher Christian decides to start a mutiny.—Zeger DESMEDT The film is based on the real life story of Lieutenant William Bligh (Anthony Hopkins), against whom a mutiny is led by Master's mate Fletcher Christian (Mel Gibson). This version follows both the efforts of Fletcher Christian (Mel Gibson) to get his men beyond the reach of British punishment, and the epic voyage of Captain Bligh (Anthony Hopkins) to get his loyalists safely to the Dutch East Indies in a tiny longboat.Mission
Setting out from Britain in December 1787 for the Pacific island of Tahiti to gather breadfruit pods for transplantation in the Caribbean as slave fodder, the Bounty sailed west to round the tip of South America, but failed, due to harsh weather, and had to take the longer eastern route. Finally arriving in Tahiti in October 1788, Bligh found that due to the delays the wind was against him for a quick return journey, so he decided to stay on the island for four months longer than originally planned.
In that time, it would be fair to say that ship discipline became problematic, and many of the crew developed a taste for the easy pleasures that island life afforded, making the relation with their Captain tense. Bligh, at the same time, constantly subjected the crew to pressure, eventually reaching a breaking point.Bligh
Bligh is not shown as a cruel tyrant, but instead is seen as a traditional British naval captain and a man of his times. The worst acts of Bligh are compared with those of the crew, and is ultimately portrayed as a man who takes his sense of discipline and command too far, exceeding the limits of the ship's company; while at the same time he protected his loyal non-mutineers, when he guides their overcrowded boat to safety without any firearms or navigational equipment.Crew
The crew is portrayed in a different light than the previous films. They are shown as a group of typical 18th-century sailors-a much more ""rough and tumble"" group, some of whom use the ""might-is-right"" principle to impose a hierarchy of sorts below decks. Their motivations in this film were not as noble as in the other two films. Previous films portrayed the crew's desire for freedom from Bligh's oppressive behavior; in this version of the story the desire to return to Tahiti is shown to be one of the primary motivations behind the mutiny. Also, they are shown as having more responsibility than they did in the other versions of the event.Fletcher Christian
Fletcher Christian is a much more complex character than in prior films. He and Bligh are at first friends, and Bligh even asks him to sail for a second time with him. But both men turn against each other over the course of the events. Matters become worse when the ship leaves Tahiti, as Fletcher is forced to leave his wife Mauatua behind. The film is based on the real life story of Lieutenant William Bligh (Anthony Hopkins), against whom a mutiny is led by Master's mate Fletcher Christian (Mel Gibson).

Fletcher Christian is a much more complex character than in prior films. He and Bligh are at first friends, and Bligh even asks him to sail for a second time with him. But both men turn against each other over the course of the events. Matters become worse when the ship leaves Tahiti, as Fletcher is forced to leave his wife Mauatua behind. Christian's Tahitian wife is given as more of a reason that Fletcher led the mutiny than before. Fletcher shows regret over one of his decisions; he tells another mutineer that he wished he had supplied Bligh with muskets before setting him adrift.The Bounty leaves Tahiti
The resumption of naval discipline, and a Bligh who has slowly turned into a tyrant not willing to tolerate any disobedience whatsoever, creates an atmosphere of tension and violence. Corporal punishment is meted out for the slightest offense. Bligh insists that the boat is dirty and orders the crew to clean up several times a day. Many of the men, including Christian, are singled out for severe, even hysterical tongue-lashings by Bligh. His intention to round Cape Horn once again in attempts to circumnavigate the globe pushes the crew to the breaking point.The mutiny
Playing on Christian's obvious resentment against Bligh's treatment of both him and the men, the more militant members of the crew finally persuade Christian to take control of the ship. Bligh is roused from his bed and arrested, along with those considered loyal to him, and all of them are forced into the ship's launch, minimally supplied, and cast adrift.
Blissfully happy at their new-found freedom (though Christian feels remorse, and understands the implications of what's been done) they naively sail back to Tahiti to collect their wives, girlfriends, and native friends. King Tynah, however, is shocked by this turn of events. He makes them aware that, as mutineers, their presence on the island could incite King George to declare war against Tahiti and his people. Realising the folly of staying, though some do, they gather supplies and sail away to try to find a safe refuge. Christian pleads with Tynah to allow Mauatua to decide her own destiny. Tynah concedes, and Mauatua chooses the uncertainty of a life with Christian over remaining with her father but without her husband.Bligh's journey
Bligh, through courage and excellent seamanship-and also a return of his good character and leadership qualities-successfully manages to reach civilization after a very harrowing journey. One man was killed by natives as the crew stopped for supplies in a hostile island.Final voyage of the Bounty
The search for a safe haven is long and seemingly impossible, as they all realize that any pursuing Royal Navy vessels will search all known islands and coastlines to find them. By this point, those that remained on board the Bounty are so frustrated that they are ready to rebel against Christian in order to turn the ship back towards Tahiti. After Christian forces the crew to continue on, they eventually find Pitcairn Island, a place which Christian realizes may not be marked on British maps of the region. Christian notes that his charts indicate that the island was sighted by a sailor named Pitcairn but no landing was made due to the lack of suitable terrain, and that the island's location only was recorded by its latitude; the lack of a precise longitude made its location an unknown and therefore their best hope of avoiding the Royal Navy.As the crew of the Bounty burn the ship to keep it from being found, the judgment of Bligh's court martial is read-Bligh is found to have not been responsible for the loss of the Bounty, and is commended for the voyage of the open launch. Fletcher Christian and his men realize that they will never go back to England."
1984,1984,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087803/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"In a totalitarian future society, a man, whose daily work is re-writing history, tries to rebel by falling in love. Longing for freedom, the lowly bureaucrat of the Ministry of Truth, Winston Smith, summons up the courage to write down his unspoken desires in his little secret diary. Serving silently at the pleasure of the grim, autocratic hyper-state of Oceania, Smith knows that the English Socialist Party's supreme leader, the omnipotent Big Brother, watches his every move, condemning the already terrified people into a life of slavery. Under those dire circumstances--as the totalitarian government's suffocating stranglehold tightens more and more--Julia, another equally seditious party member, crosses paths with Winston, and a dangerous clandestine affair begins. Now, there's no turning back, and, sooner or later, the illicit couple will have to pay for its hideous crimes against the dictatorial state. What makes a good citizen?—Nick Riganas It's 1984 in the Territory of Oceania, formerly England. It is ruled by a totalitarian regime led by Big Brother espousing an ideology called Ingsoc. Big Brother is ever seeing through a two-way camera system, which not only broadcasts continually about the regime and its fight against enemies, especially the resistance led by Emmanuel Goldstein, but has eyes on the populace, who are referred to as brothers and sisters. When not broadcasting, a still photograph of Big Brother is on the screen representing his omnipresence. Individual freedoms are seen as the cause of all society's problems, hence Big Brother's control over what everyone says and does, which includes a move to end not only the thought and practice but also the need for love and sex. Anyone breaking the rules, in action or thought - the latter called ThoughtCrimes - are dealt with by the Thought Police. Winston Smith is a seemingly faithful low level bureaucrat for the Party, his job to rewrite history to the Party's guidelines, in the process he destroying any hard evidence of the reality of actual history. However if the Party knew, Winston would be considered a criminal as he has been keeping a diary of his individual thoughts, he writing out of sight of the cameras, and has been clandestinely purchasing banned items from a black marketeer, Charrington. Although suspect of her at first, Winston discovers another subversive working inside the bureaucracy, a young woman named Julia, the two who fall in love in their shared pro-freedom values. If they are caught by the Thought Police, they will discover the lengths Big Brother takes to control brothers and sisters, and in the process learn what is reality and what is manufactured by the Party for its own end.—Huggo In the year 1984, rocket bombs and rats prey on the inhabitants of the crumbling metropolis of London. Far away on the Malabar Front, a seemingly interminable war rages against Eastasia. The Ministry of Truth broadcasts ceaselessly to the population via its inescapable network of telescreens. These devices, which pervade all aspects of peoples' lives, are also capable of monitoring their every word and action. They form part of an elaborate surveillance system used by the Ministry of Love, and its dreaded Agents, the ""Thought Police"", to serve their singular goal: the elimination of ""thoughtcrime"". Winston Smith is a Party worker, part of the vast social caste known as the ""Outer Party"", the rank and file of the sprawling apparatus of government. Winston works in the Records Department of the Ministry of Truth, the section charged with modifying historical news archives for consistency. When by chance, Winston uncovers incontrovertible proof that the Party is lying, he embarks on a journey of self-questioning. In doing so, he becomes a thought-criminal. Winston begins to notice that a young Party member, Julia, is watching him. She wears the distinctive sash of the ultra-zealous Anti-Sex League, and Winston fears that she is an informant. However, to his surprise, she reveals herself as a subversive, and they embark on an illicit and dangerous relationship. This prompts Winston to explore deeper the blur between propaganda and reality. Ultimately, it leads him to O'Brien, a member of the Inner Party who sets Winston on an irreversible course of discovery.—richard.leader@gmail.com In 1984, Oceania is an omnipresent state ruled by Big Brother with a totalitarian society and in permanent war, presently against Eurasia, with the intention of keeping the proletariat without education and possibility of capital accumulation. People from the upper classes follow the ""Ingsoc"" philosophy, and are under permanent surveillance of Big Brother through the ""telescreen"", a monitor that is a television and also spies the life of each individual. However, the proletariat is free of the control of the state. The Party has just released the tenth edition of the Newspeak Dictionary, with the intention of reducing the words to make people be limited to express any feeling against the Party. In the ""Minitrue"" (Ministry of Truth in Newspeak), the bureaucrat Winston Smith re-writes history to control the future of the party and is quite indifferent to his society. Winston is approached by the party member O'Brien that gives a copy of the new released dictionary to him. When Winston meets Julia, they commit ""sexcrime"", and fall in love for each other. But they are captured by the fearful Thought Police and Winston is interrogated and brainwashed by O'Brien that explains the logic of the party to keep the power. But in the end, the human spirit prevails.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Set in a dystopian April 1984, nearly 40 years after the end of the second world war, and a few years after the so-called Atomic Wars, Winston Smith (John Hurt) is a middle-aged man who endures a squalid existence in the totalitarian superstate of Oceania under the constant surveillance of the Thought Police. The story takes place in the decaying city of London, the capital of the territory of Airstrip One (formerly Great Britain). Winston is just another lowly Politcal Party official in the Ministry of Propaganda. He lives in a small, dirty flat, and works in a small office cubicle alongside dozens of other men and women at the Ministry of Truth, rewriting history in accordance with the dictates of the Party and its (probably mythical) supreme figurehead, Big Brother (Bob Flag), a Joseph Stalin--esq leader who is never seen in public and whom appears only on propaganda posters, advertising billboards, and television monitors. Winson's task, like many in his office, is to ""erase"" anyone who has fallen afoul of the government from the official histories whom becomes ""unpersons"". Automaton-like, he goes through his daily routine, under constant surveillance from the ""telescreens"" (two-way TV monitors) and his fellow citizens. Winston occasionally attends public rallys at Victory Square where the citizens are shown propoganda films of the current war situation as well as contraditing and false news stories about Oceana's war effort to unite the civilized world under the rule of Big Brother.While his co-worker and neighbor, Parsons (Gregor Fisher), seems content to follow the state's laws, Winston, haunted by painful childhood memories and restless carnal desires, keeps a secret diary of his private thoughts, thus committing thoughtcrime: the crime of independent thought either contrary or superfluous to the aims of the Party. The so-called 'Party' is the former English parlament which follows Ingsoc (Newspeak term for ""English Socialism""); the political ideology of the government of Oceania.His life takes a fatal turn when he is accosted by a fellow Outer Party worker; a mysterious, bold-looking young woman named Julia (Suzanna Hamilton) a print machine mechanic who works in the Ministery of Truth, and they begin an illicit affair. Their first meeting takes place in the remote countryside where they exchange subversive ideas and have a sexual encounter in the woods out of view and earshot of the nearest telescreen. Shortly after, Winston rents a room above a pawn shop (in the supposedly safe proletarian neighborhood) where they continue their liaison. Julia, a sensual, free-spirited young woman, procures contraband food and clothing on the black market, and for a brief few months they secretly meet and enjoy an idyllic life of relative freedom and contentment together.It comes to an end one evening in June 1984 when the Thought Police suddenly raid the flat and arrest the two of them. It is revealed that there is a small telescreen hidden behind a picture on the wall in their room, and that the elderly proprietor of the pawn shop, Charrington (Cyril Cusack), is in fact a covert agent of the Thought Police. Winston and Julia are then separated and taken away to be detained, questioned and brutally rehabilitated.Winston is brought to a fortress-like building which is called the Ministry of Love, where he is systematically tortured and brainwashed by O'Brien (Richard Burton), a high-ranking member of the Inner Party whom Winston had previously believed to be a fellow thoughtcriminal and agent of the resistance movement led by the archenemy of the Party, Emmanuel Goldstein (who, like Big Brother, perhaps does not exist).O'Brien instructs Winston about the state's true purpose and schools him in a kind of catechism on the principles of ""doublethink"" the practice of holding two contradictory thoughts in the mind simultaneously. Doublethink entails the willful denial and destruction of all self-evident truths, memories, and/or physical proofs which run contrary to the supreme ""reality"" that is invented by the Party at any given time.For his final rehabilitation, Winston is brought to Room 101, where O'Brien tells him he will be subjected to the ""worst thing in the world,"" designed specifically around Smith's personal phobias and traumas. When confronted with this unbearable horror which turns out to be a cage filled with vicious, carnivorous rodents, Winston's psychological resistance finally and irretrievably breaks down, and he hysterically repudiates his allegiance to Julia. Now completely subjugated and purged of any rebellious thoughts, impulses, or personal attachments, Winston is restored to physical health and released.Winston returns to the Chestnut Tree Café, where he had previously seen the rehabilitated thought criminals Jones, Aaronson, and Rutherford (themselves once prominent but later disgraced members of the Inner Party) who have since been ""vaporized"" and rendered unpersons. While sitting at the chess table, Winston is approached by Julia, who has also been brainwashed and rehabilitated. They share a bottle of Victory Gin and unemotionally exchange a few words about how they have betrayed each other. After Julia leaves, Winston watches a TV news broadcast of himself on the large telescreen confessing his ""crimes"" against the state and imploring forgiveness of the populace in the humbled and remorseful manner of a prodigal son come back to the fold.Upon hearing a news report declaring the Oceanian army's utter rout of the enemy Eurasian forces in North Africa, Winston silently and tearfully professes his gratitude and love for Big Brother as he anticipates the date of his execution. Having been deprived of his freedom to think and feel for himself, and reduced to a mere shell of a man, Winston is soon to be deprived of his very physical existence as well. He now welcomes his final subjugation to the absolute power and supremacy of the state as he says ""I love you"" to the glowering, ever-watchful visage of Big Brother on the telescreen."

Jake refuses to comply and tell him where the stash is and runs away.In a popular 80's cliche'd chase scene, a rock soundtrack ensues with Sam in a furious, drug-fueled frenzy relentlessly chasing Jake all over the town, including tearing down a chain link fence and Jake hitting his dirt bike with another car.

Jake agrees.The two of them go to the house where Jake hid the stash. Jake retrieves it. Back on the way home, Sam is now totally calm, but in a sinister way telling him they need to be family and work together no matter what happens, reassuring him of no pain or gain. Jake is beyond saddened and crushed knowing that he has lost the ability to protect his family and that he and his brother now have to live in this nightmare, but Sam is oblivious to his hurt.Back at the house, Wendy has finally come to her senses and packed Sam's bags telling him to get out of the house. She tells him she is fed up with his abuse and does not want him around her boys. Sam refuses, she stands her ground, and he slaps her. Jake hits Sam for it and Sam is mercilessly beating Jake up and Brian comes to Sam hitting him on the back with a baseball bat. Sam is about to beat Jake to death with the bat, but in a popular climactic cliché, Jake kicks him in the crotch with Sam falling over. He leaves and the three are a family again."

Zanda first orders the pilot to circle the nearby village, so that the Zamboulis will come out to witness their so-called protector die. Using her telepathic abilities, Sheena summons flamingos that surround the helicopter and attack the pilot, while Zanda falls to her death.

He sets himself up in with a room in a bar owned by an old friend, ""Fat"" Moe Gelly (Larry Rapp), and begins to investigate the summons he received. Having lived for years under the assumed name of ""Robert Williams"", Noodles is suspicious of the letter, thinking that he's been called back to see to the reburial of his old friends, Patrick ""Patsy"" Goldberg (James Hayden), Philip ""Cockeye"" Stein (William Forsythe), and Max Bercovic (James Woods), who he used to be in a gang with. Noodles believes someone is seeking revenge against him.In flashbacks to 1920, the boys grow up in poverty in a Jewish neighborhood on the Lower East Side. They ostensibly work for a young local Irish gangster named Bugsy (James Russo); however, Noodles (now played byScott Tiler) and his friends Patsy (Brian Bloom), Cockeye (Adrian Curran) and Dominic (Noah Moazezi), have ambitions to strike out on their own. One day, while attempting to ""roll"" a drunkard (Gerritt Debeer), they are foiled in their plot by Max (Rusty Jacobs), who has just moved into the neighborhood with his mother (Marcia Jean Kurtz). He keeps the drunk's pocket watch and leaves the boys to be harassed by a local policeman, Whitey (whom the boys call ""Fartface"") (Richard Foronjy), who constantly bullies them. Noodles finds Max later and demands the watch back. Whitey happens by and takes the watch for himself. Noodles and Max come to admire each others' resolve and decide to be friends. Though Noodles and Max share leadership of the gang, it is Max who is the more charismatic and makes most of the decisions for them.One day Patsy spies Whitey walking along the rooftops of the neighborhood and follows him. Patsy immediately realizes that Whitey is going to see their pre-teen (albeit physically matured) friend, Peggy (Julie Cohen), who prostitutes herself. The boys catch Whitey in the act and photograph him; Patsy quickly disappears with the film plate. Whitey acquiesces to their demands that, as the new gang in the area, he pay them as much in tribute as he does Bugsy and that he do some enforcement work for them. They also get their watch back from him and make him pay for Noodles and Max to have sex with Peggy.Noodles has long desired to become romantically involved with Fat Moe's (Mike Monetti) sister, Deborah (Jennifer Connelly); their father, Mr. Gelly (Chuck Low), owns the local kosher restaurant. While using the men's room in the restaurant, Noodles often spies on her through a small hole in the wall while she practices her ballet steps and undresses afterward. Deborah, however, mostly ignores his advances, with the exception of an intimate moment they share when the restaurant is closed during Passover.The boys become something of a success in their neighborhood, thieving houses and stores and rolling more drunks and other weaker types for small earnings that are substantial for themselves. When Bugsy hears that there's another gang that isn't under his control, he and his thugs horribly beat Noodles and Max just outside Deborah's father's restaurant during Passover. Bugsy steals all of the money that Noodles and Max have on them and warns the boys, ""you work for me, or you work for nobody!"" When Noodles pleads with Deborah to let him inside after the vicious beating, Deborah refuses.Undaunted, the boys meet with a local Italian mobster, Al Capuano (Clem Caserta), and show him an invention of Noodles' that will allow Capuano to keep all the imported cargo he illegally deals even after his ships crews are forced to throw it overboard by harbor customs agents. The first time the boys use Noodles' invention, it works perfectly and the boys are overjoyed at the cargo that floats to the surface. Max falls overboard and doesn't surface for a seemingly long amount of time. Worried that his friend has drowned, Noodles looks for him and is perturbed when Max finally appears having just faked drowning. Noodles is not amused.The invention is a success and the boys become very wealthy, receiving 10% of Capuano's earnings. They rent a train station locker and stash their cash earnings in a leather briefcase, promising that they will only withdraw or deposit funds from the locker when they are all present, and that the key will be kept by Fat Moe. On their way back from the station, they are attacked by Bugsy, who this time carries a pistol. Dominic is the only member of the gang who is shot by Bugsy (being the smallest, he is unable to run for cover as fast as his companions) and dies in Noodles' arms. Noodles retaliates and stabs Bugsy to death with a switchblade several times before two mounted policemen try to stop him. Noodles, still in a fit of rage, stabs one of the policemen before he is arrested and sentenced to 12 years imprisonment. His friends turn out to see him delivered to the juvenile reformatory.In 1932, Noodles is released from prison, where he is picked up by Max. Max explains that he and the rest of the gang have set themselves up in an undertaking business. However, the mortician's parlor is a front for their real business: bootlegging liquor, which has made them rich. According to Max, they run the most popular speakeasy in the city; they hide the scotch they serve in the building's steam heating system. A party is held for Noodles on his return and Max introduces him to some new associates, Frankie Manoldi (Joe Pesci) and his partner Joe (Burt Young). Frankie and Joe want the gang to rob a diamond broker's they own in Detroit. During the heist, Noodles is goaded by the broker's masochist secretary, Carol (Tuesday Weld), into assaulting and ""ravishing"" her; Noodles does so despite a stern warning from Joe not to abuse her. The gang meets with Joe to give him the diamonds and kill him and his men on Frankie's orders. Noodles, unaware of the deal that Max made with Frankie to murder Joe, is quite angry with Max; his reasoning is that their gang should not be liable to anyone like Frankie and should operate independently. Also, Noodles is concerned that one day Frankie may want Noodles or Max to eliminate the other. Max assures Noodles it will never happen. As they drive away from the scene, Noodles foolhardily drives their car off a long pier into the bay. [Everyone except Noodles escapes the car and surfaces. After a few minutes, the guys worry that Noodles may have been killed by a nearby dredging machine, but he appears soon after - a mirroring of Max tricking him when they were teenagers.]Some time later, in 1933, the gang then begins to aid a local union leader, Jimmy ""Clean Hands"" O'Donnell (Treat Williams), who has made a career of standing up to corrupt labor leaders, particularly a man named Crowning (Gerard Murphy). After rescuing Jimmy from Crowning's thug, Chicken Joe (Richard Bright), who is about to burn him alive, the gang offers their assistance to Jimmy, who initially refuses their help, not wanting to deal with men who operate in bootlegging, drugs or prostitution.Next, the gang turns their attention to a local labor strike being engineered by a celebrity police captain, Vincent Aiello (Danny Aiello). Aiello is being manipulated by the factory owners into allowing his officers to protect the scab workers the owners have allowed into their factory. The gang concocts a brilliant and diabolical scheme to switch Aiello's newborn son (his family's only boy after four girls) at the hospital: Noodles calls him just after he discovers the switch (the gang switched his boy for a girl in the nursery) and tells him to call off his officers and let the workers and management work out the strike. However, when Patsy tries to remember which baby they switched Aiello's boy for, he can't; he's lost the switch list with the child's number on it. The mix-up doesn't faze the gang, however, and they agree to simply give Aiello the number of a random boy from the ward, coldly laughing over the fates of some of the children they'd mixed up.During the time that the gang is expanding their business dealings, Noodles rekindles his romance with Deborah (now played byElizabeth McGovern). He arranges for a lavish vacation for them both at a posh resort in the Hamptons that is closed for the season. Revealing that his desire to be reunited with her was what drove him to see through his prison term, Noodles admits his love for Deborah; however, she is still reluctant to get romantically involved with him, and reveals that she intends to leave for California to pursue her acting career. On their return trip back to the city in their limousine, Noodles rapes Deborah. Ashamed, he orders the driver (producerArnon Milchan) to take her home. [While drowning his sorrows in drink, Noodles meets a young prostitute named Eve (Darlanne Fluegel), who returns his affections and soon becomes his girlfriend; in his stupor, he spends their first night together calling her ""Deborah"".] Some time later that day, Deborah boards a train to California. Noodles (still dressed in his tuxedo from the night before), arrives and from a distance in the station, watches her leave. When the drunken Noodles calls out to Deborah, closes the compartment blind when she sees him.After three weeks away, Noodles returns to the gang after Cockeye finds him in the opium dens of Chinatown smoking heroin and calling out for his lost love Deborah. Brought back to the gang's headquarters, Max fills in Noodles about what happened in his absence; the labor union paid off the gang and given Max a personal throne and made him full leader of the gang.While calling Max and Noodles for assistance, Jimmy is nearly killed on the street by Chicken Joe in a drive-by shooting. The gang retaliates, shooting at Crowning outside his club, killing his bodyguards, including Chicken Joe (but sparing Crowning who is unharmed but shaken). With a wounded leg, Jimmy is crippled for the rest of his life but is able to continue his career. While they celebrate with Jimmy in the hospital, Jimmy's attorney, Sharkey (Robert Harper), tells the gang that Prohibition may soon end and they should think about entering legitimate business with their large fleet of bootlegging trucks, with Jimmy acting as their front. Max seems to like the idea, however, Noodles is unconvinced, still adhering to his old mantra of not working for anyone but themselves. Max suggests that Noodles' idea of business is too archaic and that they need to expand to make more money, but Noodles still adheres steadfastly to his street code. Also, Frankie Manoldi is seen arriving at the hospital and going to Jimmy's room.A few months later, Prohibition approaches its end, and the gang find themselves out of work. Noodles and Max take a vacation to Florida with their respective girlfriends, Eve and Carol. Not wanting to go into legitimate work, Max reveals an audacious plan to rob the Federal Reserve bank in Manhattan. Noodles thinks the plan is too outrageous, knowing that it almost certainly would get him and the rest of the gang killed. Carol - who by this time has joined the brothel that Peggy (Amy Ryder) runs in conjunction with the gang's speakeasy, and has become Max's girlfriend - tries to convince Noodles to get Max to abandon his plan, or tip the police to get Max arrested to give him time to think over the scheme's absurdity.Noodles plans to alert the police about a liquor exchange Max has planned with Cockeye and Patsy, which is set to take place a short time after the gang's party in celebration of the end of Prohibition. In the speakeasy office, Noodles makes an anonymous phone call to Police Sergeant Halloran to tip him off about the liquor exchange. Noodles hopes that with Prohibition near its end, Cockeye, Patsy and Max's arrest will lead to them serving short jail sentences and thus avoid the robbery. After Noodles makes the phone call, he sits alone for a while in the office. A few minutes later when Max joins him, Noodles again tries to advise him not to go through with the bank robbery. Max refuses and accuses Noodles of losing his courage. When Noodles tells Max that his idea and that Max himself is crazy, this suddenly provokes Max into viciously assaulting Noodles and beating him up. It is later revealed that just the word ""crazy"" is a sensitive topic and that it is a vulnerable fact of Max's life. It is revealed that Max's father was mentally unbalanced and died in a sanatorium when he was a young child.Noodles shows up at the site of the liquor buy during a cold and rainy night and sees that Patsy and Cockeye have been killed, while Max appears to have been horribly burned beyond recognition. Noodles then goes to Chinatown with a newspaper detailing the police ambush and death of his friends to get ""lost in the Chinks"".Four mobsters show up at Noodles apartment looking for him (depicted in the first scenes of the film) and murder Eve after she refuses to tell them where Noodles is. Next, the mobsters go to Fat Moe's apartment and torture him to confess where Noodles is after they reveal that they know that Noodles tipped the police off which led to Cockeye, Patsy and Max being killed. When the mobsters arrive at the opium den (a run-down movie theater), Noodles is tipped off by the owners about the mobsters arrival and escapes. He goes to Fat Moe's and kills the thug left behind to watch Fat Moe. After learning from the bloodied Fat Moe that Eve is dead and that every gang member in the city is looking for him, Noodles (who cannot understand how the mobsters know all about it since he never told anyone about tipping off the police), retrieves the key to the locker at the train station. At the station, he finds that the money has been replaced with newspapers. Puzzled, Noodles buys a one-way bus ticket to Buffalo and leaves.During his sleuthing in 1968, Noodles finds out that his friends were moved to a different cemetery and an elaborate mausoleum was constructed for them. When the bronze doors to the mausoleum are opened, an automated recording plays the same Pan flute tune that Cockeye played when he was alive. He finds the key to the train station locker on a plaque inside that states Noodles himself put the plaque and key there to honor his friends.[Noodles then has a chance encounter with the cemetery's directress (Louise Fletcher); referring to himself by his ""Robert Williams"" identity, Noodles asks about ""Mr. Aaronson""'s level of involvement in the mausoleum's construction, and whether she had any contact with him. She reveals that aside from his suggestion of the inscription above the bronze doors - ""Your youngest and strongest will fall by the sword"" - and providing a tape recording of Cockeye's song, he gave the architects free reign with regard to its building, and that the deal was finalized through his overseas bank account. During their conversation, Noodles notices that he's being tailed by the unseen driver of a Cadillac, which speeds away as he tries to approach it, although he manages to write down its license plate number.] He goes to the train station locker and finds the same leather case and more money inside totaling at least one million dollars. A note inside the case reads ""Advance payment for your next job"".[Noodles traces the Cadillac to the Long Island mansion of Christopher Bailey, the US Secretary of Commerce; the car suddenly explodes as he watches it leave via the front gate.]While at Fat Moe's bar, Noodles sees a TV news report that Bailey is under investigation for corruption; several witnesses set to testify against Bailey, including the passenger of the destroyed Cadillac (a District Attorney), have all died under mysterious circumstances. Noodles suspects a connection between Bailey and the money left to him. Before visiting Bailey's house under invitation to a party, he tracks down and talks to Carol (now living in a retirement home called the Bailey Foundation) who tells him that Deborah is once again living in the New York City area and is now a famous actress. [After seeing Deborah's Broadway performance of ""Antony and Cleopatra""], Noodles visits her backstage; the two have a lengthy conversation, during which Noodles notes that the role of Cleopatra is perfect for her, since, unlike everyone else he knows from his past life, ""Age (has) not wither(ed) her"". Deborah's most important revelation is that she and Secretary Bailey are together, and have a grown-up son, also named David, who bears a striking resemblance to Max when he was younger.Secretary Bailey is, in fact, Max, and that night hosts the party, which is attended by many of New York's most influential people. [There, Bailey/Max is privately confronted by Jimmy, whose tenure as a union leader has become a front for criminal activities that are secretly supported by Max. However, their working relationship has turned sour, as Max has enough evidence with which to testify Jimmy and his colleagues' guilt before the corruption committee. He is responsible for the assassination of the District Attorney - an attempt on Max's life - and coerces him into signing documents transferring some of Max's power to him in exchange for David's financial stability and safety. As Jimmy leaves, he suggests that Max should avoid assassination altogether by committing suicide, which Max somewhat agrees with.]Noodles arrives at the party, and is brought before Max, who reveals that - with the help of Jimmy and corrupt members of the police - he faked his own death during the liquor exchange where he was ""killed"" and has, for the past 30 years, created the Bailey persona as a disguise. With the threat of assassination looming over the upcoming investigation, Max tells Noodles that he is the only person that he will allow himself to be killed by (hence the money and the cryptic note in the suitcase), given that he took from Noodles what mattered most to him - the gang's money and Deborah. Noodles refuses the offer, and he continues to refuse to acknowledge that Max is alive, still referring to him as ""Secretary Bailey"" or ""Mister Bailey"". Noodles explains to Bailey/Max that he feels betrayed and has felt guilty for the entire span Max was gone, which is punishment enough. He leaves through a secret passage out of Bailey/Max's office.Out on the street outside Bailey's estate, Noodles catches a glimpse of Bailey/Max standing by the road. A garbage truck [which Noodles had noticed in his earlier scouting of the mansion] drives by, the augers in the back clearly visible. When the truck drives past, Bailey/Max is gone.... suggesting (but not concluding for certain) that Bailey/Max threw himself into the garbage truck blades to his death. As Noodles watches the red taillights of the garbage truck driving away down the road, the lights magically turn white, and they become the headlights of a convoy of cars from the 1930s driving by the Bailey mansion playing theKate Smithsong ""God Bless America"", akin to celebrations from the end of Prohibition. Noodles then walks away into the night, alone.The film ends back in 1933, with Noodles visiting a Chinese opium den in the immediate wake of his friends' death. Laying down after a few puffs from an opium pipe, he smiles as the closing credits roll.(It has been suggested by some fans, critics and film historians that the 1968 sequences were all part of an opium-induced dream experienced by Noodles.)"

But, has anyone ever spread his wings away from Grandview, U.S.A.? With only a week left before he graduates high school in the small Middle Western community of Grandview, the eighteen-year-old dreamer, Tim Pearson, is itching to renounce an uninspiring scholarship, stand up to his despotic father and pursue a career in oceanography, away from home.

His father Roger (Ramon Bieri) loans him his brand new Cadillac to go to the senior prom with Bonnie Clark (Elizabeth Gorcey). Later, while Tim and Bonnie are making out in the car near a stream, the car's parking brake fails and the car literally rolls in, so they walk to ""Cody's Speedway"", a local garage, for a tow.When Bonnie's father (M. Emmet Walsh) comes for her, he punches Tim in anger. Mechanic Michelle ""Mike"" Cody (Jamie Lee Curtis) defends him, and has local demolition derby driver Ernie ""Slam"" Webster (Patrick Swayze) tow the car with Tim.

Running into Mike, he thanks her for helping him with the car and asks to drive in the derby.Tim goes out to the Speedway, where he meets Mike's mentally challenged brother, Cowboy (John Philbin). Later on that night, Mike goes to the bar to see her uncle Bob (William Windom), asking to borrow $10,000 to fix up the Speedway. He doesn't have the money, but wants to help.

Mike and Bob help him out to his truck, and she and Slam talk about old times.Hungover at work the next morning, Slam's boss sends him home.

This Is Spinal Tap,1984,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088258/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Spinal Tap, one of England's loudest bands, is chronicled by film director Marty DiBergi on what proves to be a fateful tour. In 1982, the legendary English heavy metal band Spinal Tap attempt an American comeback tour accompanied by a fan who is also a film-maker. The resulting documentary, interspersed with powerful performances of Tap's pivotal music and profound lyrics, candidly follows a rock group heading towards crisis, culminating in the infamous affair of the eighteen-inch-high Stonehenge stage prop.—Jeremy Perkins {J-26} The English heavy metal band Spinal Tap embarks on their biggest tour in the US to date to promote their new album ""Smell The Glove"". The tour is so big that it's attracted the attention of documentary filmmaker Marti DeBergi, who decides to make a movie about Spinal Tap's trek across America. But as the documentary goes along, Spinal Tap sees their audiences dwindle from selling out huge arenas to going to play at charity benefits, and eventually playing private parties where no one pays attention to their music. Their new album drops and it's decently reviewed by critics, but the record stores have a huge problem with the sexist overtones of the album's cover, causing a loss in sales. However, a series of incidents that constantly shoot themselves in the foot - whether it's a minuscule Stonehenge monument, a stage prop malfunction, or a simple two word review of an album - keep preventing the band from enjoying the success they deserve. But how long can they keep playing to 11? And will they find the audience that suits them?—halo1k DirectorRob Reiner(as Marti DiBergi) follows the fictional English rock group Spinal Tap on their latest tour in this mockumentary. The famed band, with a dozen or more studio album, have a lot to deal with. They clearly aren't as popular as they once were and face playing before sparse crowds in smaller venues. They also have to deal with canceled dates (not to worry, their manager says when they learn their gig in Boston has been canceled, it's not a big college town), arguments about their latest album cover and the arrival of one of the band member's girlfriend who would like to play a role in managing the band. All in all, not a successful tour.—garykmcd Legendary British rock band Spinal Tap is followed by a documentary film-maker during their attempt at an American comeback tour. The resulting film, interspersed with powerful performances showcasing Tap's pivotal music and profound lyrics, candidly follows the group as the difficult industry threatens to fade them into obscurity. Neophyte director Marty DiBergi (Rob Reiner) presents this ""rockumentary"" showcasing the North American tour of aging rockers Spïnal Tap. Band members David St. Hubbins (Michael McKean), Nigel Tufnel (Christopher Guest), and Derick Smalls (Harry Shearer) form the core of the group, with a keyboardist, Mick Shrimpton (RJ Parnell) and various drummers dying over the years in freak accidents or through spontaneous human combustion. The band is set to promote their new record, ""Smell the Glove,"" featuring a degrading photograph of a woman in bondage smelling a glove.Their first gig is a huge success selling out New York City's Madison Square Garden. Before the tour begins their promoter holds a huge party for the band as they've successfully completed their latest record ""Smell The Glove"". The record company CEO toasts Spinal Tap's success by ""Tapping Into The Millennium"", which coincidentally is the name of their tour.Next they're being interviewed by Marty DiBergi. We learn the history of Spinal Tap from the beginning of the band's origins through the present day. It seems that they've gone through a number of lineup changes and drummers - one spontaneously combusted while another choked on vomit, which was not his own.Spinal Tap is being transported to their next gig, and to pass the time they're reading the autobiography of Rat Pack member Sammy Davis Jr.. The limo driver has a one-sided conversation with them about Frank Sinatra's history. The next song being played is their smash hit single ""Big Bottom"", which features the three lead members all playing bass guitars. We also learn how Spinal Tap's back catalog was received by critics. Most of the albums received rather mixed reviews, but one album called ""Shark Sandwich"" received just a two word review - ""Shit sandwich"". Their religious rock album ""The Gospel According To Spinal Tap"" was also rather poorly received.Their next stop takes them to Atlanta for the Recording Industry Convention. There, they learn a couple of gigs were canceled, but nothing to be worried about. It appears that the record label marketing department was completely offended by the proposed cover as stores have said they flat out weren't going to sell the album, citing it as ""filth"". Spinal Tap's promoters get into a huge argument with the record label CEO Bobbi Fleckmann (Fran Drescher) who cites their album cover as ""sexist"".While backstage for their next gig in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, Nigel is complaining about the quality (or complete lack thereof) of the food being presented to them. He tells the manager that it's a complete catastrophe and that they wouldn't like being served that food either. The next song they play is ""Hell Hole"" which is rather well received by the theater crowd. During the song Nigel gets in a rather tense guitar solo and falls to the ground requiring roadies to pick him up. The next day Marti is going over Nigel's massive amounts of equipment that they transport from show to show. He then explains how their amplifiers don't end at 10, they go to 11 which is one louder. Their next gig in Charlotte proves to be another disaster when their gig is cancelled due to a ""lack of advertising funds"".The next interview with Marti we learn that Spinal Tap has a dwindling audience. At the start of last year's tour they were booked into 10,000 and 15,000 seat arenas. Now they're being booked into 4,000 and 6,000 seat arenas, a fact that their manager, Ian Faith (Tony Hendra) dismisses as a sign that the band's popularity is waning. They proceed to take out their frustrations by destroying their hotel room. As Nigel is on the phone to their promoter, they learn that a number of their gigs across the Midwest have been cancelled. But thankfully they're saved when Derek informs them that a song they recorded in the past called ""Listen To The Flower People"" was being played on the local radio. But their happiness is short lived when the announcer refers to them in the ""where are they now"" segment. Shortly before this blow to their collective ego, David is on the phone with his longtime girlfriend, Jeanine Pettibone (June Chadwick) who tells him she can come see him when they arrive in Milwaukee. Nigel is less than enthused; he views Jeanine as an interloper and a disruption to his relationship with David.Thankfully Spinal Tap has managed to secure a gig in Memphis. There, they pay tribute to Elvis Presley by making a stop at Graceland and singing ""Heartbreak Hotel"", though none of the band members can remember the words, nor sing in harmony. Spinal Tap's first single was released in 1968 and they've been a band ever since, and evolving with the times and trends, though the recent times have not been kind to them. We also learn of another drummer that died a mysterious death - this one spontaneously combusted on stage.At their next gig in Milwaukee, they play a sound check where they play another song from their very early days called ""Give Me Some Money"". Jeanine appears and while David is thrilled to see her, Nigel can barely hide his disappointment. Ian appears with a box of copies of ""Smell The Glove"" where they're stunned to learn that the studio has decided to go with their decision to release the album cover in all black instead of the proposed and very controversial cover. Their next song is called ""Rock And Roll Creation"" and Derek gets trapped in his prop pod during the entire song and the roadies desperately try to free him with no success.The next interview with DiBergi interviews Spinal Tap's drummer. There he asks whether or not the history of Spinal Tap drummers has him afraid of what might happen to him. He says it's no big deal. On the tour bus to their next gig the band throws a huge party.While in Chicago, they have a record signing, but no one shows, upsetting the band and the promoter (Paul Shaffer) blames himself. Spinal Tap manages to secure their next gig in Cleveland. Unfortunately as the crowd is demanding they play, they get lost repeatedly making their way to the stage in a cluttered and maze-like basement. The next gig in Albuquerque proves to be particularly embarrassing as the only gig they've managed to secure has them opening for a magician at a rich kid's birthday party. The rift in the band grows larger. While on a break between gigs, Jeanine presents the band with her own illustrations of new onstage costumes and makeup for the band. Nigel is again annoyed and tells everyone they can enhance their live performances with a prop for one of their greatest songs, Stonehenge. He draws a quick diagram of the scenery on a napkin, handing it to Ian who says he'll have it made.The next live show has the band performing Stonehenge with a spoken-word prelude by Nigel and the band wearing druid-like costumes. When the model of Stonehenge descends from the rafters, they're astonished to see that it's only 18 inches high instead of life-sized. In his napkin drawing, Nigel had mixed up feet with inches. Dwarf dancers in Celtic costumes dance around the prop, threatening to knock it over.Back at their hotel after the gig, the band gets into a fight with Ian, blaming him for all the recent live mishaps and lost gigs. Ian argues that he's overworked, buried in the logistics of the tour, the petty and petulant demands of the band themselves and often called upon to perform impossible tasks. David suddenly suggests that they replace Ian with someone who can manage the tour more effectively, namely Jeanine. Ian explodes and storms out.Their next gig takes them to San Diego and the Miramar Air Force Base where they're the entertainment for a weekend reception. The band goes on, playing one of their raunchier songs, Sex Farm. Unfortunately the crowd isn't interested and stop dancing and sit back down, many of them covering their ears. A frustrated Nigel finally walks off the stage, slamming his guitar down after his wireless box picks up and broadcasts one of the base's air traffic signals. While being interview by DiBergi, David tries to gloss over Nigel's departure by saying that bands go through many changes and that it won't affect the remainder of the tour. He also admits he'd be more upset if he ""weren't under such heavy sedation"" at that particular moment.The last date of the tour is in Stockton, California at a local county fair, where he band is billed under a puppet show. Backstage, the band is hastily trying to come up with a live set without Nigel. Many of the songs they play live are Nigel's and are cut out of the lineup. Derek says what they have left will constitute a show of no more than 10 minutes. He suggests they play an experimental song he's been developing for several years called ""Jazz Oddyssey"" a free-form instrumental at least 10 minutes long. Onstage, David introduces the band as a reborn unit, Spinal Tap Mach 2, with Jeanine playing tambourine. The audience show their immediate displeasure, many of them leaving or giving the band the thumbs down sign.A party is thrown in Los Angeles to mark the end of the U.S. tour. David and Derek talk about several side projects they've both had in mind that they feel they can explore now that Nigel is gone. One of the ideas is a musical, ""Saucy Jack"", based on the life of Jack the Ripper. They also believe they can wring a few more years out of the nearly-defunct Tap, even without Nigel.At another late gig, the band are ready to go onstage when Nigel suddenly appears. He tells them he bumped into Ian and found out that ""Sex Farm"" has become a big hit in Japan and that he'd be willing to come back for a tour. David rebuffs him but accepts a wish of good luck from Nigel before the go on, playing ""Tonight We're Gonna Rock You Tonight"". As he stands watching them at the side of the stage, David motions for Nigel to join them. Nigel runs up, grabs a guitar and begins to jam. The final scene has the band playing live to a huge Japanese audience, seemingly revitalized. Ian has also rejoined them, seemingly taking up his old position as manager, with Jeanine nearby. The band plays to thunderous applause."
C.H.U.D.,1984,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087015/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A bizarre series of sudden disappearances on the streets of New York City seems to point toward something unsavory living in the sewers. A rash of bizarre murders in New York City seems to point to a group of grotesquely deformed vagrants living in the sewers. A courageous policeman, a photo journalist and his girlfriend, and a nutty bum, who seems to know a lot about the creatures, band together to try and determine what the creatures are and how to stop them.—Philip Brubaker <coda@nando.net> The film opens with a woman walking her dog down a empty, darkened city street. As she passes by a manhole, she is attacked by a creature, and the dog is pulled in after her.George Cooper (John Heard) lives with his girlfriend Lauren (Kim Greist). George, a once-prominent fashion photographer, has since forgone the fame and fortune. His current project is photographing New York City's homeless population, specifically those known as ""undergrounders"", or people who reside within the bowels of the city. Lauren is a current fashion model who met George during one of his photo jobs.A police captain named Bosch (Christopher Curry) is introduced. Bosch has a personal interest in the recent flood of missing persons (most of whom are homeless) being reported to his precinct. Bosch interviews A.J. ""The Reverend"" Shepherd (Daniel Stern), who runs the local homeless shelter and soup kitchen. Shepherd believes recent events to be a part of a massive government cover-up and has the evidence to prove it which include an NRC radiation detector and a boot which is part of an anti-contamination crewperson.Bosch's superiors know more than they are letting on and seem to be taking their cues from an overly glib, weasely type named Wilson (George Martin), who works for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.It turns out there are monsters lurking beneath the streets; beings that were once human, but radioactive, chemical toxic waste has mutated them into hideous, flesh-eating creatures that prey on the homeless who live in the underground. Given the recent drop in the underground transient population, the creatures have resorted to coming to the surface through sewer manholes at night in order to feed.When Wilson sends a EPA crew to clean up part of the sewer, Bosch has a group of policemen armed with flamethrowers escort them. Watching through a video camera one of the EPA men has, they encounter an unknown number of the creatures and the video is suddenly cut off.Next, Bosch, Wilson and their associates view a dead creature that was found and Wilson admits that a top-secret goverment file that he has, titled 'C.H.U.D.' that the creatures stand for Cannibalistic Humanoid Underground Dweller, the former homeless people infected by nuclear radiation. Captain Bosch argues with Wilson over how to best deal with the threat: Wilson wants to seal the sewers, open up some methane gas lines, and asphyxiate the C.H.U.D.s, despite the inherent danger to the city that the poison gas could drive the creatures to the surface.Through a series of events, both George and A.J. Shepherd find themselves trapped in the sewers. George goes down with a local reporter (who gets eaten). Because of the secret that Wilson and his unseen superiors guard, it leads to the extent of having a mysterious and threatening lackey disrupt A.J. from making phone calls to the press. This thug then locks A.J. in an underground access tunnel. George and A.J. later find each other and attempt to escape from the sewers while evading the creatures.Meanwhile, Lauren is alone in her apartment waiting for George to return when she deals with a clogged shower drain which splurts up blood. Next, a creature comes up through the sewer access point that Lauren unfortunately decided to open in the basement of her apartment building. The so-called CHUD creature kills two policemen who investigate noises in the building. The creature breaks into Lauren's apartment, only to be dispatched when she decapitates it with a sword.Next, a group of the creatures (more then four are never shown on screen) attack a local diner and apparently kill everyone there. Because of the media coverage of the massacre, Wilson decides to take charge the start the flooding of the sewers with gas. When Lauren sees this announcement on her TV set, she sets out to find George, having previously told him that she is pregnant. She takes the murdered policemens car and races off to find help.Through the dangerous investigative efforts of both A.J. and George, the absolute horror is revealed. They find crates of nuclear and radioactive waste in an area which is the CHUD's dwelling place. Seeing the boxes marked 'C.H.U.D.' they realizes that CHUD actually stands for 'Contamination Hazard Urban Disposal.' The Nuclear Regulatory Commission is directly involved in the slaughter that has been going on. Although the political bureaucracy has forbidden the NRC to transport the toxic wastes through New York because of the large-scale danger to the public, it has secretly been hiding the waste by-products beneath Manhattan in abandoned subway tunnels. Unfortunately, the underground homeless population has been coming into contact with these by-products, turning them into the mutated creatures.George and A.J. find the remains of the dead EPA and police crew and use the video camera to call for help and they inform Bosch about what they found. With Wilson already starting the gas flow to kill the creatures, Bosch attempts to save the two men, only for Wilson to stop him. Bosch reveals that he knows all about the goverment cover-up and of the real abreviation for CHUD. Wilson pulls out a gun, intending to kill Bosch to protect his secret, but Bosch overpowers him and takes the keys to a delivery truck blocking a manhole cover to let George and A.J. out. But just when Bosch drives the truck off the manhole cover, Wilson appears and shoots him. Wilson then comandeers the truck to run over and kill George and A.J. However, Lauren also comes upon the scene and attempts to help them escape. A.J. takes Bosch's gun and shoots at Wilson as he drives the truck, fataly wounding him. The truck hits the open manhole and it explodes due to the methane gas pouring out of the sewer. George and Lauren embrace, happy to be reunited, while A.J. is releaved that Bosch, despite being shot through the chest, is still alive as he stands near the remains of the burning truck."

Mrs. Soffel,1984,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087751/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Diane Keaton stars as a prison warden's wife who falls in love with a death row convict (Mel Gibson.) Believing he's innocent, she helps him and his convicted brother escape. Peter Soffel is the stuffy warden of a remote American prison around the turn of the century. His wife, Kate, finds herself attracted to prisoner Ed Biddle. She abandons her husband and children to help Ed and his brother Jack escape and accompanies them into the wintery wasteland.—Reid Gagle 1901. Peter Soffel is the warden at Allegheny County Prison in Pittsburgh. He is rather an emotionless man, which affects his relationship with his wife of eighteen years, Kate Soffel, the two who have a cordial but somewhat emotionally distant marriage. They live with their four children on the prison property. Despite there being a chaplain on prison staff, Kate provides Christian spiritual guidance to the inmates. Following a three month serious health issue, Kate returns to her work including with two infamous new inmates, brothers Ed and Jack Biddle, who are sentenced to death for murder. Although the brothers are admitted robbers, there is some question within the public mindset if they did commit the murder in question. They have their legion of fans, primarily young women, who are attracted to their charisma and particularly Ed's good looks. Kate and Ed get into philosophical discussions of Christ and redemption, specifically in his and Jack's situation, which leads to them getting to know each other. Although initially done for different motives on both sides, Ed does convince Kate to help him and Jack escape from prison. Ultimately, the motive becomes love, the two who have fallen for each other. As such, Ed convinces Kate to run off with them, much against Jack's wants. What happens to the three is affected largely by that public mindset, some who want them caught at all cost, some who want solely to say they were involved in dealing with the famous Biddle brothers, and some who believe them innocent and want them to succeed. Of those old enough to understand what is happening, Kate's family members also have their own views of what she did and how it affects their individual relationships with her if she ever does return.—Huggo"

Bud tells Otto that his wife is at the hospital about to deliver twins and that he needs to get her car out of the bad neighborhood.Otto follows Bud in the car to the Helping Hand Acceptance Corporation, where he learns that the car he drove was being repossessed and Bud's story was a ruse. After defiantly pouring out the beer they give him, he refuses to join Bud as a ""repo man,"" and goes to his parents' house. He learns that his burned-out ex-hippie parents have donated the money they promised him for finishing school to a crooked televangelist. He decides to take the repo job. Bud teaches Otto what he calls the Repo Code and about the lifestyle of a repo man which involves dressing like a cop, working very late hours, getting little sleep and snorting speed to keep awake. Bud also tells Otto about the Rodriguez Brothers, Hand Acceptance's chief competition in the repo business. They engage the brothers in a brief race in the LA River with Bud yelling insults as the Rodriguez' speed off.After repossessing a flashy red 1976 Cadillac, Otto sees a girl named Leila running down the street. He gives her a ride to her workplace, the United Fruitcake Outlet. On the way, Leila ducks down in the footwell when she spots two men in the next car who dress like government agents. She shows Otto pictures of aliens that she says are in the trunk of a Chevy Malibu. She claims that they are dangerous because of the radiation that they emit. Meanwhile, Helping Hand is offered a $20,000 bounty notice for the Malibu. Most assume that the car is drug-related, because the bounty is so far above the actual value of the car.Parnell arrives in L.A. driving the Malibu, but he is unable to meet his waiting UFO compatriots because of a team of government agents led by a woman with a metal hand. When Parnell pulls into a gas station, Helping Hand's competitors, the Rodriguez brothers, take the Malibu. They stop for sodas because the car's trunk is so hot. While they are out of the car, a trio of Otto's punk friends, Duke, Debbi and Archie, who are on a crime spree, steal the Malibu.After they visit a night club, Parnell appears and tricks the punks into opening the trunk, killing one of them and scaring the other two away. Later, he picks up Otto and drives aimlessly, before collapsing and dying from radiation exposure. Otto takes the Malibu back to Helping Hand and leaves it in the lot. The car is stolen from the lot by an unidentified thief, and a chase ensues. By this time, the car is glowing bright green.Eventually, the Malibu reappears at the Helping Hand lot with Bud behind the wheel, but he gets shot by government agents who arrive on the scene in a helicopter. The various groups trying to acquire the car soon show up; government agents, the UFO scientists, and the televangelist. Anyone who approaches it bursts into flames, even those in flame-retardant suits. Only Miller, an eccentric mechanic at Helping Hand, is able to enter the car. He slides behind the wheel and beckons Otto into the Malibu. After he settles into the passenger seat, the Malibu lifts straight up into the air and flies off, streaking around downtown Los Angeles at high speed. Otto happily says the ride is ""intense"" and Miller replies"

Against a background of war breaking out in Europe and the Mexican fiesta Day of Death, we are taken through one day in the life of Geoffrey Firmin, a British consul living in alcoholic disrepair and obscurity in a small southern Mexican town in 1939. The Consul's self-destructive behaviour, perhaps a metaphor for a menaced civilization, is a source of perplexity and sadness to his nomadic, idealistic half-brother, Hugh, and his ex-wife, Yvonne, who has returned with hopes of healing Geoffrey and their broken marriage.—Eric Wees <eric_wees@ccmail.chin.doc.ca> It's November 1, 1938 - the Day of the Dead - in Cuernavaca, Mexico, which is located in the shadows of Popocatépetl. Geoffrey Firmin, British Consul to Mexico, has just quit his job. His best friend is a bottle of booze, as he constantly tries to drown out the world's and his own personal problems. The former category includes the Spanish Civil War, the rise of Nazism in Germany and the associated effect it has on Mexican nationalism. The latter category mostly concerns the divorce a year ago from his actress wife, Yvonne Fermin, who has left Mexico but has tried to keep in touch with him via correspondence. Despite she having written to him several times with her intentions (to which he never replied), Yvonne returns to Cuernavaca on this day to, on the surface, rekindle their marriage. A slight strain is placed on the proceedings by the fact that Geoffrey's younger half-brother, Hugh Fermin, is also in Cuernavaca. Hugh, who was covering the war in Spain, decided instead to come to Mexico to help his brother regain sobriety and thus his life. But a self-destructive Geoffrey may make Hugh and Yvonne's tasks difficult if not impossible.—Huggo Under the Volcano follows the final day in the life of self-destructive British consul Geoffrey Firmin (Albert Finney, in an Oscar-nominated tour de force) on the eve of World War II. Withering from alcoholism, Firmin stumbles through a small Mexican village amidst the Day of the Dead fiesta, attempting to reconnect with his estranged wife (Jacqueline Bisset) but only further alienating himself. John Huston's ambitious tackling of Malcolm Lowry's towering ""unadaptable"" novel gave the incomparable Finney one of his grandest roles and was the legendary The Treasure of the Sierra Madre director's triumphant return to filmmaking in Mexico."

After seeing two people having sex in the storage room, he has flashbacks of his parents' murder, and ends up killing them both. He then sets off on a massive killing spree. Can he be stopped? Or will Santa deliver new presents to all the little kids?—Nathan Redmond (lana_ca@hotmail.com) It's Christmas Eve 1971, and the Chapman family - father, mother, and two sons, Billy, age 5, and infant Ricky - are traveling in their station wagon along desolate Utah roads, with the radio for company. They arrive at their destination, a state mental hospital, where they visit Grandpa. Grandpa is severely mentally ill, and while not dangerous, he can't take care of himself. He doesn't seem to even realize he has visitors. The father and mother, with little Ricky, go off to discuss things with the doctors, leaving Billy momentarily alone with Grandpa. As soon as they are alone, Grandpa turns his head and smiles, and starts talking to Billy. He tells him ""the truth"" about Santa Claus: that Santa will only leave presents for boys and girls who have been good all year; those who haven't, Santa punishes instead. Billy is terrified, because he hasn't been good all year and he knows it. Grandpa returns to his trance before the rest of the family returns to collect Billy for the return trip home. It's after dark by the time they get started.On the way home, Billy, having taken Grandpa's words to heart, asks his mother if Santa Claus ever punished her when she was little. The mother is visibly upset by this question, and taken aback when Billy tells her that Grandpa told him the story. She pronounces Grandpa a silly old fool, which disturbs Billy even more. He had been taught it was naughty to say bad things about old people, and Santa Claus might punish his mother for it.Meanwhile, not too far away, a man in a Santa Claus suit robs a gas station at gunpoint, and kills the clerk when he tries to fight back. He leaves with only $31, swearing as he gets into his getaway car, which we see later broke down. The Chapman family has the misfortune to meet him when they drive up to him on the highway, thinking he is on his way to a party when he had car trouble. Billy is terrified, thinking Santa has come to punish him, and his worst fears are borne out when the man pulls his pistol, intending to steal the station wagon. The father slams the car into reverse trying to escape, but the man shoots him dead, and the car crashes into the ditch. Billy runs out of the car to hide in the bushes while the Santa drags his mother out of the car and rips her clothes off, intending to rape her. The mother fights back, and the Santa, further enraged, changes his mind and kills her with a switchblade instead. Then, with Ricky crying in the background, the Santa stands by the side of the road, looking for Billy, saying ""Where are you, you little bastard?""Now it is near Christmas in 1974. We see that the boys both survived, but we aren't told if the killer was ever caught. Billy, now 8, and Ricky, now 3 or maybe 4, live at a Catholic orphanage. Billy's gruesome Christmas drawing gets him into trouble, and he is sent to his room by the Mother Superior while the other children play outside. She discusses the case with the younger nun, Sister Margaret, who was teaching the class. Margaret realizes that Billy remembers what he saw, is mentally unstable and gets worse every Christmas, but the tyrannical Mother Superior believes that Billy was too young to remember and she can beat the thoughts out of him. Margaret goes to release Billy from his room, believing that getting outside will do him good, and knowing that Billy will improve after Christmas. Billy walks down the hallway, but is distracted when he hears noises coming from a closed room. Peeping through the keyhole, he sees two of the orphanage's older residents, in their teens, naked and having sex. He has a flashback to the murders, remembering his mother being forcibly stripped by the Santa Claus. Mother Superior catches him there and throws him aside before entering the room to punish the teenagers with her belt.Billy goes outside to play, but the Mother Superior soon comes back for him to punish him, brushing aside Margaret's protests that she gave him permission to go outside. The Mother Superior explains to Billy that the teenagers he saw were being naughty, and they were punished, and that he would now be punished himself for leaving his room. Mother Superior whips him with the belt and sends him to bed. Later, Billy has a nightmare about the murders and runs into the hallway screaming, and Mother Superior catches him and punishes him again by tying him to the bed.On Christmas morning, the orphanage has a man in a Santa Claus suit come by, and of course Billy is terrified of him. Mother Superior drags him kicking and screaming to Santa, and he punches Santa in the face and runs back to his room. Soon Mother Superior comes to administer even more punishment...Now it is spring 1984. We see Sister Margaret, ten years older but looking much the same, talking to the manager of a toy store, Mr. Sims. Sims is reluctant to hire Billy, who just turned 18 and is ready to leave the orphanage and enter the real world, but changes his mind when he meets Billy, who has grown tall and strong, just what Sims needs for the warehouse. Billy starts the new job and for the first few months, it works out well for him. Besides him and Sims, there is Mrs. Randall, the assistant manager, Andy, the warehouse clerk, and Pamela, a girl who helps in the store. But Christmas comes eventually, and few places are more into it than toy stores. Billy is upset, especially by the Santa Claus imagery, and it affects his work. Andy, who shamelessly sucks up to Sims but is verbally abusive to his co-workers when Sims is not around, yells at Billy about it.Shortly before Christmas, Sims has a problem. The guy whose job was to play Santa Claus in the store hurt himself, and the only replacement available was Billy. So they dress Billy up as Santa Claus and the next day, the parents shopping at the store remark of how good he is with the children - in fact, he frightened them into silence with his warnings of punishment, believing that's what Santa Claus does. On Christmas Eve, just before closing time, Sister Margaret calls the store to see how Billy is getting along, it being his worst time of year and all. When Andy tells her that he is dressed as Santa Claus, she realizes that this was a very bad idea, and she sets out to go there. It will be awhile before she arrives.At closing time, Sims locks the store and starts the Christmas party by getting out the booze. Everyone seems to be having a good time, except Billy, still in the Santa Claus suit, who is still moody, thinking about his parents' murders. Sims, becoming more and more drunk, tries to cheer Billy up while Andy takes Pamela into the back. Billy, becoming somewhat drunk himself, believes Sims's joke that he will soon think he is Santa Claus. He walks to the back, and sees Andy becoming more aggressive with Pamela, he has ripped her shirt open. Seeing this give him another flashback to the old days, and this pushes him over the edge at last. Believing that he really is Santa Claus and has the power to punish the naughty, he steps forward and kills Andy by hanging him from a string of Christmas lights. Pamela freaks out, and Billy, believing her to be naughty as well, cuts her stomach with a utility knife. Sims, thinking he heard noises in the back, goes to investigate, and Billy kills him with a claw hammer. Mrs. Randall, realizing she is alone, goes to look for Sims, and finds him dead. She runs for the door, but it is locked. Then she goes for the phone, but Billy chases her with a double-bit axe. She hides from him, then pushes him down and takes his axe, intending to break the doors and escape. Billy picks up a bow and and shoots her with an arrow from across the room. Then he unlocks the door and leaves, axe in hand, a few minutes before Sister Margaret finally arrives to see what Billy has done.Next, we see two policemen, incredulous that they have orders to pick up Santa Claus. They see a man in a Santa suit climbing in the second-floor window of a nearby home, and go to get him, but it turns out to be a false alarm: it was the man who lived there, intending to surprise his young daughter.Next, we see a teenage girl named Denise, making out with her boyfriend Tommy on top of a pool table. The girl's younger sister Cindy starts walking down the stairs, anxious for Christmas to arrive and hoping to see Santa Claus. Not wanting to be seen half-naked, she tells Cindy to go back to bed lest Santa pass the house by. She does so, unhappily. Then Denise hears jingling outside, and tells her boy-friend to wait for a moment, so she can let the cat in. Denise pulls on some very short shorts, and wearing nothing else, goes to let the cat in. The cat runs inside, but then Billy shows up, dressed in the Santa suit and carrying his double-bit axe. Denise screams and slams the door shut, but Billy breaks the door down. After a brief struggle, Billy picks up Denise and impales her on the antlers of a trophy deer that was hung over the fireplace. Tommy couldn't hear the ruckus over the radio, and has been killing time playing pool. Eventually he goes up to check on Denise, finds the door broken and then finds Denise hanging on the antlers. Then he meets Billy. He puts up a better fight, but eventually Billy gets hold him and throws him from the window, where he lands on the hard ground outside, breaking his neck.Just as Billy gets ready to leave, Cindy comes out of her room again, and she is overjoyed that she did get to meet Santa Claus. Billy asks Cindy if she's been good all year, and she insists that she has. Billy puts a ""present"" into the little girl's hands, the utility knife, and then he leaves. We can hear Cindy's voice, puzzled but excited, calling for her sister to tell her what she saw.Meanwhile, two boys in the early teens are out for a late-night sled down a snowy hill. Before they start, they are set upon by two older boys who steal the sleds for themselves. The first one sleds down the hill; the second is attacked by the axe-wielding Billy halfway down. He falls sideways off the sled at the bottom of the hill, his head rolling down behind him. The other boy screams.By morning, Billy has still not been caught. Sister Margaret, who had fallen asleep at the police station, wakes up and one of the policemen tells her the bad news, three more killings overnight. They believe that Billy will likely return to the orphanage and radio the police there to keep a lookout for a man in a Santa Claus suit. Sister Margaret tries to call the orphanage to warn them, but one of the little girls there has been playing with the phone and left it off the hook, so she only gets a busy signal. After several failed tries, she and one of the policemen set out to drive there.One of the policemen on patrol near the orphanage does see a Santa Claus walking toward the orphanage, and gets out of the car and yells for him to stop. When the man doesn't respond, the policeman shoots him. He falls forward, dead. But we soon learn that this was a case of mistaken identity when the dead man turns out to be middle-aged. Sister Margaret instantly recognizes the description as that of Father O'Brien, who had been their Santa Claus for several years, and who could not hear the policeman because he was deaf.The policeman apologizes to the Mother Superior, and tells her that the killer may still be coming and that he will keep watch. Over the last ten years, Mother Superior's health has declined, she is now in a wheelchair and no longer able to physically punish the children, but she is every bit as bitter and hateful. She tries to comfort the children, who have just seen Santa Claus shot dead, by leading them in singing Christmas carols, while the policeman circles the building. The children include Billy's younger brother Ricky, who was a baby at the time of the killings but is now in his early teens. The policeman makes his rounds but he is ambushed by Billy, who has finally arrived at the orphanage. Billy kills him by slamming the axe into his chest.Billy then goes to the front door, and one of the children, overjoyed at seeing Santa apparently alive and well, lets him in. He walks toward the Mother Superior, helpless in her wheelchair, and raises the axe. Just then, the other policeman who was driving with Sister Margaret arrives and shoots Billy twice in the back. He falls forward, dying. His last words, to the children, are, ""You're safe now. Santa Claus is gone."" Billy's axe falls at Ricky's feet, and he appears ready to pick up where his older brother left off someday, as he looks at Mother Superior and says, ""Naughty!"""
Choose Me,1984,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087054/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Love doctor radio host Nancy, bar owner Eve, Pearl, drifter Mickey et al meet in LA. Several lost-soul night-owls, including a nightclub owner, a talkback radio relationships counseller, and an itinerant stranger have encounters that expose their contradictions and anxieties about love and acceptance.—Robert Dennys <robertd@psy.uq.oz.au> During the mid 80's Alan Rudolph became one of the most interesting ensemble cast filmmakers since Robert Altman.
His quirky boutique dramas had style and flair and a touch of the 80's hip angst. This is my favorite of that time. The art direction and camera movements are as much story tellers as the dialogue. Pay attention to the paintings and posters in the scenes. They almost always have a subtext comment to the exact scene being spoken by the actors. And Rudolph loves to let his actors act! There is a brilliant scene where Mickey (Keith Carradine) is eating breakfast with Nancy/Ann (Geneviève Bujold). The camera pulls back, zooms in and pans like a tennis match as the actors go thru an unbroken 3 plus minute dialog scene. I haven't seen a scene go that long since the opening of Rope! This film is full of great dialog, style and fun!"

Along with a friend, they eventually end up visiting their aunt in the wastelands of Cleveland and then proceed to Florida where they lose all their money gambling before unwittingly gaining a fortune.—J.Arnold Free <arnold@mayahtt.ca> and Brian McInnis The New World: The teenager Eva Molnar arrives in New York City from Budapest, Hungary, and visits her cousin Willie, A.K.A. Bela Molnar. Eva intends to travel to Cleveland to stay with her Aunt Lotte, but the old woman is in the hospital and Eva has to stay with the idle Wille, who is absolutely indifferent to her. They spend their empty days smoking Chesterfields, watching television and playing solitaire and Eva meets Willie's friend Eddie. Then Willie and Eddie are connected to Eva and they miss her when she travels to Cleveland. One Year Later: Willie and Eddie win a large amount in the poker game and they borrow a car and travel to Cleveland to visit Eva. They spend a few boring days in the house of Aunt Lotte.

In Act One, Eva has just arrived in New York - her first time in the United States - and will be staying with Willie in his stark and bleak one room apartment for ten days before she heads to Cleveland to take care of their Aunt Lotte. Aunt Lotte asked Willie to do her and Eva this favor, but he makes it clear to both women that he does not want Eva there, and does not want Eva to *be* Hungarian let alone speak Hungarian. Eddie, on the other hand, likes his friend's cousin, but Eva is still left to her own devices without much to do. An incident before Eva's departure to Cleveland changes the dynamic between the three. In Act Two, Willie and Eddie, who have just come into a windfall albeit by less than ethical means, decide to visit Eva and by association Aunt Lotte in Cleveland. Both Aunt Lotte and Eva are happy to see the pair, but a year and distance may have changed the situation between the three, while the location does nothing to add to it. In Act Three which immediately follows Act Two, Willie and Eddie, on the spur of the moment, decide to invite Eva to Florida with them rather than return back to New York, if only to escape winter. There, Willie and Eddie are more concerned with the routine of their lives and what they know, however unimaginative, than they are with being in Florida or with Eva. Eva, coming upon an opportunity, has to decide what to do about her life in the US as a whole.—Huggo Willie is a pre-slacker-era slacker living in New York City.

She has to go into the hospital for 10 days and Eva will have to delay her visit on seeing her until then and stay with Willie.The young lady, Eva, is walking to Willie's apartment on the lower east side and we get glimpses of a lonely, desolate landscape of a part of Manhattan few are familiar with as she walks down the street playing Screamin' Jay Hawkins on a tape recorder singing ""I've Got a Spell on You""Eva arrives at Willie's apartment and he's not all that thrilled about her visitation disrupting his otherwise monotonous and lonely lifestyle. He lets her in and gives her a place to sleep. During this timeframe, Willie does little besides watch TV, sleep, introduce her to TV dinners, play solitaire, and introduce her to his friend Eddie, a fellow friend. During this timeframe, little happens, but the two bond together and he accepts her as family.After staying with Willie over a week, Eva leaves to board a train to Cleveland, where her Aunt Lottie lives. Eddie comes to say goodbye to her on the street after she leaves Willie's apartment changing out of a tacky dress he bought her. Eddie then goes to Willie's apartment and the two of them have a beer together with no conversation.A year later, Eddie and Willie are having a poker game at a man's apartment and they win over $600 with one man outraged that they cheated, but they walk out with the loot and intend to travel with it.Soon afterwards, Eddie and Willie borrow an old 1965 Plymouth out of New York City bound for Cleveland to see Eva.

"Paris, Texas",1984,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087884/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Travis Henderson, an aimless drifter who has been missing for four years, wanders out of the desert and must reconnect with society, himself, his life, and his family. A man wanders out of the desert after a four year absence. His brother finds him, and together they return to L.A. to reunite the man with his young son. Soon after, he and the boy set out to locate the mother of the child, who left shortly after the man disappeared.—Ed Sutton <esutton@mindspring.com> After an absence of 4 years, Travis Henderson suddenly reappears in a deserted part of south Texas. His brother Walt fetches him and he is soon reunited with his son Hunter. He can't really explain why he's been away or why he's suddenly reappeared. Walt has been raising Travis' son Hunter and it takes a while for the two of them to get reacquainted. They eventually set off together to find Jane, Travis' wife and Hunter's mother. She is found working in a peep show in Houston but a happy family reunion isn't in the cards.—garykmcd A man stumbles out of the desert in southern Texas. He appears to be mute, and doesn't respond to questions. The hospital he ends up in calls his brother in California, who comes to take him back to LA. His brother hasn't seen him in four years. What caused him to be catatonic and wandering around in the desert?—grantss Four years after he disappeared without a trace, Travis Henderson reemerges in the small US border town of Terlingua, Texas, where his Los Angeles residing brother Walt Henderson must retrieve him. Travis, looking a little worse for wear, is initially mum about everything that has happened in his life in the intervening years, especially why he and his wife, Jane Henderson, individually abandoned their lives and their marriage which resulted in who was their then four year old son Hunter Henderson being dropped off with Walt and his wife, Anne Henderson. Believing that Travis and Jane had both since died, Walt and Anne have raised Hunter as their own, he who does not generally remember either of his biological parents. Travis' return is thus bittersweet for Walt and Anne who have to decide what to do about Hunter and his relationship with his biological father, which nonetheless is strained in Hunter not really knowing Travis. Travis' return is not by accident as it is just the next step in he reconciling his life with regard to Hunter which involves his want to go to Paris, Texas, where he has purchased some property. But that reconciliation takes a turn when Anne divulges some information to him, which leads to a trip to Houston to make that reconciliation perhaps not more holistic but just in Travis' mind.—Huggo The film opens with sweeping shots of the vast, barren Texas desert as the camera follows a man wandering through this terrain. The man is shown entering a rundown bar as he collapses in exhaustion. The next day, a doctor treating the speechless traveler makes a call to a family member, who we discover is the brother of the ailing man, recommending that he pick his brother up. As Walt, the brother of the wanderer Travis, leaves for Texas from Los Angeles, before the doctor has returned to his patient, the viewer finds that Travis has taken off continuing his wandering through the empty land. Travis is finally found and picked up by Walt in South Texas as Walt tells his silent brother that they are heading back to Southern California. Though Travis is yet to speak, the viewer hears Walt explain how he has not seen nor heard from Travis in four years. Their first stop along the road is a small motel where they plan to rest for the night, but when Walt leaves to get food from the market, Travis starts the shower and takes off again. Walt returns to discover Travis is gone and quickly tracks him down not far up the road and is able to get him back into the car. The next scene shows the two in a diner, Travis still silent, and Walt begins to question Travis more forcefully about his disappearance adding that he left his son, Hunter, behind when he was three for Walt to take care of in Travis' absence. The viewer sees Travis is effected by the mention of his abandoned son as tears flow from his eyes; however, he still fails to answer Walt's inquiries. The pair continue on their road trip the following day and finally Travis begins to speak in the car. He produces a weathered photograph of a vacant lot with a ""For Sale"" sign explaining to Walt that he purchased the property and that it is located in Paris, Texas- a city mentioned to him by their mother that he believes to be the location of his conception. While Walt is curious about this idea, he claims that he is continuing on to Los Angeles to bring Travis to his son. Upon their arrival, Travis meets the wife of Walt, who has practically mothered Hunter for the last four years, and he confronts the young boy, who is uncomfortable and timid towards the stranger. Walt decides that showing some old home videos might help to break the ice of the awkward relationship between Travis and Hunter. The videos show touching moments of Travis with a newborn Hunter and his wife, Jane, sharing a day at the beach with Walt and his wife. That night, the viewer sees Travis carry out chores around the house as he is sleepless and bewildered by his presence in this house with his son. The next day, Travis shows up at Hunter's school attempting to walk home with him; yet, Hunter sees him across the street, grows weary, and jumps in a car with a friend. Hunter explains that night to Walt's wife that he does not want to walk home at all from school, and certainly not with Travis. She pleads with him to give Travis a chance as he sighs somewhat in compliance. Travis tries again the next day to walk Hunter home and he makes progress as the two silently walk on opposite sides of the street. The viewer sees that eventually Travis's persistence pays off as he and Hunter are beginning to converse more on their walks. One night, as father and son have now grown more comfortable with each other, Walt's wife tells Travis in secrecy that she knows Jane, Hunter's mother, is still around and that she in fact deposits money into a bank account for Hunter on the same day of every month. She goes on to tell Travis the name of the bank and that it is located in Houston, Texas. Travis is almost immediately determined to seek Jane out and he tells Hunter of his plan the next night, explaining why he has to leave, as Hunter tells his father that he wants to accompany him on his journey.The following day, after school, the two of them leave together without telling Walt or his wife and once they are far enough out of town, Hunter calls the house telling his caretakers for the last four years that he has left for Texas with Travis. Walt and his wife are devastated as they have both grown extremely close to the boy, but know that they could not have kept him forever. The following scenes show the growing closeness between Travis and his son on this road trip including Hunter educating Travis on things he has learned in school, Travis telling Hunter a little about Jane, and Hunter sleeping comfortably on his dad. They finally arrive at the bank in Houston on the expected day of the deposit and they split up with walkie-talkies to try and locate Jane's car. Hunter spots her as she is leaving and the two make haste to follow her down the highway. The suspected car eventually stops at a place of business and Hunter is told to wait in the car as Travis enters the building. The viewer soon discovers that the business is a peep-show parlor of sorts, where customers sit in a room at a chair on the opposite side of a one-way mirror instructing the female employees as to what they want to see via a telephone-intercom. Travis is shocked, but he enters one of the rooms requesting a blonde whom he hopes will be Jane. The first woman sent into the room is not Jane and he moves to another room where he finds Jane, ready to please her customer, but he is unable to speak. After much silence and confusion on the part of Jane, Travis walks out and returns to the car with Hunter, angry and vague in his explanation as to what he saw. Travis then drives to a bar and begins to drink as Hunter complains and Travis's irritability grows. They return back to their hotel room and Hunter confesses his distaste for this ""side"" of Travis while Travis is slowly making up his mind as to how to deal with the situation.The next day, Travis drives Hunter to a hotel in downtown Houston and drops him off in a room telling him again to wait there while Travis heads back to Jane's work. He goes into a room where Jane enters on the other side of the glass, he picks up the phone, turns his chair so that it faces away from Jane, and begins to speak. He speaks broadly at first, telling the story of a ""man"" and a ""young girl"" who met and quickly fell in love with each other. They soon had a child, he says, and married probably before they were really ready for either. Jane is initially confused, wondering why this man might be telling her this, but her confusion transforms into astonishment as Travis's story grows more and more detailed and she begins to grasp who it is on the other side of the glass telling the true story of their relationship. Travis describes how ""this couple's"" love turned from joyful to stifling, explaining how the drunken ""man"" was suffocating the ""young girl"" with his jealousy and control that he tried to impose on her. He tells how the ""man"" went so far as to tie a cowbell to the ""young girl's"" foot so that he would hear if she was trying to leave in the middle of the night and how one time, the ""man"" caught the ""young girl"" and tied her to the stove with his belt. Jane is coming to tears while Travis continues to speak, informing the viewer of how he came to loathe himself and why he had disappeared for so long never wanting to see a trace of anybody. When he finally finishes, Jane expresses how hard it had been for her to move on from Travis and that she often wondered what had become of him. He finally faces the glass, turning a lamp on his face so that Jane can get a faint glimpse of him. He tells Jane that Hunter is in a hotel room waiting for her and that he would like her to go there to be reunited with him for good. Jane agrees and Travis leaves the room. The final scene follows as the viewer watches Jane enter the hotel room where Hunter is waiting and embrace her child."

A chaotic chain of misunderstandings, lies, and mischief ensues after he devises a plot to have them murdered. Texas bar owner Julian Marty, who is generally regarded as not a nice person, hires shady private detective Loren Visser, who is able to obtain what Marty requests evidence - in this instance, photographic - that his wife, Abby, and one of his bartenders, Ray, are having an affair. As Ray and Abby realize that Marty has found out about them, it allows them to plan for their future away from Marty, while being up front with Marty about the situation. Marty, in turn, decides to hire Visser once again, this time to kill Abby and Ray, and dispose of their bodies so that they won't be found. The out-in-the-open affair and the contract hit lead to some actions based on self-interest and a standoff of sorts between the four players, which is compounded in complexity by some wrong assumptions of what has happened, with an innocent bystander, another of the Marty's bartenders, Meurice, potentially, and unwittingly, adding to the scenario.—Huggo A bar-owner in Texas is certain that his wife is cheating on him and hires a private detective to spy on her. This is the beginning of a complex plot full of misunderstandings and murder.—Mark Logan <marklo@west.sun.com> Abby is cheating on her bar owner husband, Marty, and the latest object of her affections is Ray, one of Marty's bartenders. Marty hires Visser, a seedy detective, to follow his wife and ultimately to kill her and Ray, but Visser has other plans of his own.

Abby gets one of the bartenders, Ray, to give her a ride out of town to Houston. She mentions her husband gave her a pearl handled pistol for their first anniversary and she states she figured she leave before she uses it on her husband,A seedy private detective Loren Visser (M. Emmet Walsh) hired by Marty to follow Abby, takes photos of Abby and Ray, when they end up at a local motel together rather than leaving town. Marty makes a menacing wake up phone call to them, making it clear that he is aware of their tryst.The next day Ray confronts Marty at the bar, it ends badly and Ray quits, walking out at which point Marty threatens Ray. Marty arranges for the private detective to kill the pair, and on the detective's suggestion, Marty goes out of town to create an alibi. That night, the detective breaks into Ray's house and steals Abby's revolver, partially loaded with 3 bullets, that was originally given to her by her husband.Visser uses photos he has doctored to make it appear that he has actually murdered the lovers and goes to collect his $10,000 fee from Marty, whereupon he shoots Marty with Abby's gun and drops it on the floor. Upon leaving, the detective does not realize not only has he has left behind his lighter but also the doctored photo that Marty has removed from the envelope and placed in his safe when getting the money.Later, that same evening, Ray arrives at the bar to insist that Marty pay him the back wages he's owed. Ray finds Marty shot in his chair bleeding out onto the floor. Ray discovers the gun, when he kicks it and it goes off. He recognizes the pistol as belonging to Abby. Ray is interrupted by another employee, Meurice, who arrives in the bar. Ray uses the noise from the bar jukebox to mask his attempt to clean up the blood. He removes Marty's body, dropping Abby's gun into Marty's coat pocket, puts the body into his car and drives off after throwing the bloody windbreaker and towel into the incinerator behind the bar.Driving down the highway, he hears a noise from the rear seat: Marty is alive. Panicking, Ray stops the car, jumps out the passenger door, and runs a short distance into a field. On returning to the car, he sees that the back driver's side door is open and finds Marty crawling down the highway. At first Ray debates running him over with his car, but then grabs a shovel from the trunk, intending to kill him that way, but is interrupted by an oncoming tractor-trailer. Ray considers throwing Marty into the path of the truck, but instead he picks up Marty and drags him back and into the car. Ray drives to the middle of a farmer's field, digs a hole and throws the still alive Marty in. He is in process of burying him when Marty pulls Abby's gun from his jacket pocket. He points it at Ray, and pulls the trigger and it clicks; he pulls it again twice more with the same result. Ray removes the gun from him and continues to bury Marty alive. At dawn, Ray gets his car started and drives off.Meanwhile, the private detective burns the series of doctored copies of the photograph he used to fake the murder of Abby and Ray. He opens the envelope in he handed to Marty and got back and he discovers that Marty has replaced the photo with a sign asking employees to wash their hands before returning to work. Annoyed, he tries to light his cigarette and notices his engraved prized lighter is gone.At Abby's apartment, a deeply disturbed Ray arrives and tries to explain that he cleaned up Abby's mess. Abby does not understand what Ray is talking about, and they get into an argument. Ray has blood on his shirt and Abby thinks the two men had a fight. Ray thinks Abby is being coy when she uses the same term her husband told Ray she used when he caught her cheating. The phone rings, interrupting their argument, and Abby answers but the caller doesn't speak. Abby hangs up thinking it was Marty when it was really the detective. ""Well, that was him."" ""Who?"" ""Marty."" Horrified, Ray leaves and drops Abby's revolver on the table on his way out.
Meanwhile, Meurice, the other bartender, checks his answering machine and gets a delayed message from Marty claiming that a large amount of money has been stolen from the safe and that either he or Ray took it. Meurice goes to confront Ray about the theft of the money. Abby goes to Marty's bar to try to find out what happened with Ray. Abby finds the bar ransacked, the safe's combination lock dented, chipped, and partially shattered. The private detective had been trying to break into the safe to retrieve the photo and was interrupted by Abby's arrival: he is hiding in the bar watching Abby move about. She picks up a towel from the top of the safe; a hammer falls out. Abby spins the dial but does not open the safe. The now-rotting fish that Marty brought back from his trip are still on the desk where Marty was killed; and the detective's lighter is still underneath.At her apartment, Abby lies in bed; she gets up to wash her face and hears someone enter the apartment. She calls Ray's name, then pushes open the bathroom door. Marty is sitting on the bed. He tells her that he loves her, and then warns her; ""He'll kill you too."", then pitches forward and vomits a torrent of blood. Abby wakes up from the dream. Ray is at his apartment packing when Abby arrives. Abby thinks that Marty refused to pay Ray, that Ray broke into the bar to get his money, and that the two of them got into a fight. Ray interrupts and tells her he found her gun at the bar, that he can't eat or sleep lately, and that Marty was alive when he buried him.Abby leaves to tell Meurice that she thinks Marty is dead; Meurice leaves for the bar. Ray is at the bar; he opens the safe and finds the faked photo showing him and Abby in bed, bodies riddled with holes, blood staining the sheets. He leaves for Abby's apartment and notices the same older model VW parked behind him, the same car that was following them earlier,when they ended up at the motel. Ray pulls out, and the private detective follows him. Abby arrives at her apartment and turns on the lights; Ray is looking out a large window and tells Abby to turn off the light. Abby is reluctant to do so. The private detective is on top of a nearby building, watching the two through a sniper scope, and shoots Ray through the back, killing him. Abby runs to crouch beneath the window, takes off her shoes, and throws them at the light bulb, breaking it. Visser arrives at Abby's apartment, and she goes into the bathroom to hide; outside the bathroom window is a precipitous drop. In Abby's sparsely furnished living room, Visser bludgeons Ray with a large coin bank, then searches Ray's pockets for the lighter, thinking he took it. Failing to find it, he goes into the bathroom. Abby is not there; he looks outside the window, then hearing a sound through the wall, he reaches his arm over, finding another window. He opens the window; Abby slams it on top of his wrist and drives a knife through his hand into the windowsill. The detective screams and then shoots holes through the wall and finally punches through and removes the knife from his other hand. Abby, dazed, backs out of the room and slides down the wall opposite the bathroom door, finding her revolver on the table by the door. The door is partly closed; eventually the man's shadow darkens the doorway, and Abby fires through the door, using up the third and final bullet. The detective falls. ""I'm not afraid of you, Marty,"" Abby says. Visser, laying out on the bathroom floor, bleeding from his chest and hand, suddenly bursts into laughing. ""Well, ma'am, if I see him, I'll sure give him the message."" The detective lies looking up at the underside of the bathroom sink. Water collects on its underside, grows into a drop, and drips. The movie ends."

Father Farley will tell those little white lies in more circumstances to achieve his desired end, those lies of which his devoted, loyal and devout housekeeper Margaret refuses to be a part. Although not having much to do with the diocese's seminary, Father Farley plea bargains with the Monsignor to ordain seminarian Mark Dolson as a deacon, the Monsignor's condition being only if he is to be the deacon at St. Francis for a one month probation period. The Monsignor's original want not to ordain Mark is because Mark often openly challenges what church elders tell him, the Monsignor feeling that Mark not having the temperament not only to be a deacon but more importantly a priest. Although Father Farley had seen Mark's challenges first hand and thus sees him as much as a pain in the neck as most of those at the seminary do, he came to Mark's defense in this matter if only in not agreeing with the Monsignor's open and closed judgment of Mark, the judgment solely because Mark often disagreed with his views. In spending time with Mark, Father Farley finds that Mark doesn't have a filter between his thoughts/emotions and what comes out of his mouth, in turn the congregation as a collective not having the best initial opinion of him. A series of events leads to a specific incident placing Mark's position in the church at risk. As such, Father Farley has to make a decision about how far he is willing to go to defend Mark at the risk of his own personal and professional standing. In the process, Father Farley may have to examine his own many imperfections as a priest and a human being.—Huggo"

Birdy,1984,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086969/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"After two friends return home from the Vietnam War one becomes mentally unstable and obsesses with becoming a bird. Philly boys Al and Birdy became friends in high school despite the extreme difference in their personalities, Al being the popular and athletic extrovert, Birdy the antisocial ""weird"" introvert. Al gave Birdy his nickname because of his fascination - obsession really - with birds, especially with flight. Al and Birdy have just completed their service of duty in the Vietnam War and have returned to the States. Al sustained some serious physical injuries, which required major reconstructive surgery to his face. Birdy, however, returned from Vietnam seemingly emotionally scarred. He was missing in action for one month. He has not spoken since he was found. Despite his own medical issues, Al travels to the institution where Birdy is being kept to see if he can assist in getting Birdy out of his near comatose state. Having always had issues with authority, Al is less than forthright with the doctors about Birdy's mental state prior to the war. As Al tries whatever he can to help Birdy using tools from their shared history prior to the war, he deals with his own post-war mental state.—Huggo A young man nicknamed Birdy (Matthew Modine) is sitting on the floor of his barren psychiatric hospital room. He seems in an almost comatose state.In another hospital, conscious U.S. Army Sergeant Alfonso 'Al' Columbato (Nicolas Cage), with his face heavily bandaged, is being wheeled on a stretcher to his dormitory styled room, where the orderlies transfer him to his bed. Later, the doctor is examining him, they talking about Al's facial injuries, when the bandages are going to be removed, and the likelihood of success of the completed reconstructive surgery. Apparently Al is leaving the hospital soon.Al is on a train, trying to find a place to sit down. He places his bag on the overhead rack and sits opposite a woman and her adolescent daughter. The girl can't help but stare at the heavily face-bandaged Al, who in turn notices her looking and feels her discomfort. To break the ice, Al says ""boo"" to her, and she smiles knowingly. Her mother matter-of-factly tells her not to stare. Al begins to think about his friend Birdy, who most have always thought weird.[Flashback to their high school days in South Philadelphia] In a large field sandwiched within a residential neighborhood, Al is playing in a pick-up game of softball. When he's up at bat, he hits a fly ball into the backyard of a house. He swears when he sees where it landed. The woman in the backyard picks up the ball. The kids know that the woman won't give them the ball back, she who doesn't and tells them to go play somewhere else. That woman is Birdy's mother (Dolores Sage), who has kept balls from them before. Birdy's father (George Buck), who is also working in the backyard, tells his wife to return the ball, she who refuses and walks away with ball in hand. Without another ball, the kids are forced to stop playing and they disperse. As Al begins to walk away, he sees Birdy sitting in a tree, he who looks back. They say nothing to each other.Al is making out with a girl under some bleachers. As he tries to take her clothes off, she resists, while they still kiss. Al's younger brother Mario Columbato (James Santini) comes by looking for Al. As Al tells Mario to get lost, Mario tells him that ""the weird kid"" is just down the street. Swearing about having to stop making out, Al goes with Mario. They end up at Birdy's house, Birdy who is sitting on the stoop of the front porch working on something with cooing pigeons in a cage next to him. Al calls him bird boy. Birdy says nothing. Al asks him if he has a knife to remove a splinter from his hand. Birdy hands over a pocket knife. Al tells Birdy the knife belongs to Mario. Birdy grabs the knife back and runs away as Al chases him. As they struggle, Birdy manages to elude Al while grabbing his cage. During the scuffle, Al learns that Birdy didn't steal the knife but got it from whoever did steal it. Al is incensed with Mario for not telling him that fact. Al lets Birdy keep the knife. Not knowing its true origins, Birdy offers the knife back to Mario. Al grabs it and hands it back to Birdy. Al tells Mario that he'll get him another knife. The athletic Al is interested in Birdy's natural wrestling ability, which he noticed during the scuffle. Birdy in turns asks if Al is interested in pigeons. Birdy's fascination with them is partly because of their ability to fly. Al becomes interested when Birdy tells him he's training them to become carrier pigeons. As Birdy walks away down the street, Al chases after him offering to help Birdy catch some pigeons. They end up at a railway overpass where some pigeons are taking off and landing. Birdy relates to Al the routinized behavior of the birds. The two boys climb up onto the frame support of the overpass, precariously over the busy traffic below. Al is nervous, but Birdy seems within his element. Birdy easily catches one of the pigeons just before a train rolls by which scares the remaining birds off to flight.Birdy and Al are shown in short succession catching more pigeons, transporting those birds in cages on their bicycles, and building a large wooden aviary. Al takes one of the birds and throws it up in the air. The pigeon flies back to the aviary. The boys are excited that the pigeon goes where they want it. Later, they release a flock of pigeons from a faraway dock. The pigeons fly back to their ""home"" in the aviary.Al goes to the aviary to do some work. As he goes about his work with the pigeons, he yells out for Birdy, knowing that Birdy is somewhere in the aviary. Birdy emerges covered in feathers. He is wearing a pigeon suit he made so that the pigeons will think he's one of them. Birdy wants Al to try the suit. Al doesn't want to, he who is scared to look stupid wearing a bird suit. Later that evening, Al, wearing the suit and feeling embarrassed, and Birdy, wearing another suit, are at a secured gas well site climbing to the top of the tower. Against Al's wishes, Birdy is hanging over the side collecting pigeons while Al holds his legs. Al slips, letting go of Birdy's legs. Birdy falls over the side, but manages to grab hold of the side of the tower instead of falling to the ground. A scared Al tries to get a hold of Birdy, who seems nonplussed at his predicament. Birdy sees a sand-pile below and tells Al he's going to fly down. As Al screams for Birdy not to do it, Birdy lets go. Al runs down the stairs to the sand-pile where he finds a slightly dazed Birdy, who says that he flew and it was beautiful. Al, still scared as he's unaware if Birdy is injured, hugs his friend as a police car approaches.[Forward to present day] At the hospital, Birdy is staring into space, while Al looks at him through the window in the door. Major Weiss (John Harkins), Birdy's doctor, asks for Al's assessment of Birdy. Al doesn't think he looks good and asks in return if that is all Birdy does i.e. stare into space. The doctor replies affirmatively, stating that he suffered minor physical injuries but that his main problem is something psychological. All they know is that Birdy was MIA for a month in Vietnam and when found they didn't know who he was for a while. Birdy has not spoken since he was found. Al learns that Birdy's mother was the one who suggested to the doctor to bring him here. The major hopes the visit will do both Al and Birdy some good. The major takes Al back to his office to show him photos of Birdy taken while at the hospital - they are all of Birdy in crouched positions, generally of him nude. After questioning, Al tells him that they are close and crazy friends but not queer. They talk about Al's own injuries, the casualties of the war but the fact that the military takes care of its own. The major suggests that Al go and visit with Birdy now. Renaldi (Bruno Kirby) is to be his guide.Renaldi, an orderly who does almost everything needed for the patients, takes Al to see other patients doing some physical therapy of manual hand dexterity. Renaldi ended up doing this work as a conscientious objector. As Renaldi unlocks Birdy's door, Birdy, startled and crouched on the floor, turns around. Al enters and makes some wisecracks. Birdy registers no acknowledgment. Al continues speaking about life back in South Philadelphia when they were kids, about his own injuries, and the war. Al ultimately asks him point blank what happened to him. As Al approaches, Birdy turns away. A civilian nurse named Hannah Rourke (Karen Young) enters, surprised to see Al there. As Al tells her who he is, she now remembers hearing stories of his arrival. She is the only one who Birdy will allow feed him, although this time he is not cooperating. As Hannah lets Al out of the room, Birdy turns his head to look skyward toward the window.[Flashback to their high school years] Birdy is on an examining table in the hospital, being checked for physical injuries while Al, off in the distance still wearing the pigeon suit, looks on. He tells another waiting patient that Birdy has a broken leg and perhaps a broken back, the latter which he hopes isn't the case as that can make one crazy, although Birdy is a bit crazy already.Birdy's parents are dismantling the aviary and burning the wood, while Al, reading in the newspaper of Birdy's fall, looks on, he who is more interested in the story. The pigeons that were in the aviary fly away.Al talks to a recovered Birdy about that being the end of their bird adventures, while Birdy is convinced that the pigeons will still return despite his mother having destroyed the actual structure of the aviary. Al admits that the birds did come back, but Birdy's mother poisoned some, and the others she got the local butcher to come take away for food. Birdy concedes to Al's wishes of going into a different venture together.[Forward to present day] Birdy is lying on his hospital room floor in a crucifixion position. Al, elsewhere in the hospital, is smoking and contemplating life.Later, Birdy is crouched on the floor next to the toilet, naked, staring upward. Birdy is remembering a story told by Al of a statue atop city hall that looks like it has an erection. Birdy grins slightly.[Flashback to high school years] Birdy is naked sitting on the floor of a large cage, feeling what it's like to be a caged pigeon.[Forward to present day] Birdy is still crouched in his hospital room. Shadows of birds can been seen through the window. Still, Birdy registers no acknowledgment.[Flashback to high school years] Al and Birdy are looking at a car in a junk yard, the car which they end up buying. With Al behind the steering wheel, Birdy pushes the car off the yard.As Al and Birdy work on the car, Mr. Columbato (Sandy Baron) arrives home, telling the boys the car is a piece of shit. Al curses his father under his breath.Al, behind the wheel, nervously turns the key in the ignition while Birdy, in the passenger seat, looks on. After a few sputtered attempts, the ignition rolls for a split second, to which Al and Birdy hug each other excitedly. They mockingly pretend they are off on a drive, Al speaking of driving to the ocean, to which Birdy replies that he's never been.Birdy is jumping out of the ocean waves in Atlantic City. Birdy likens the experience to flying in thick air. As Birdy dives under the water again, Al curses as he wants to party on the boardwalk instead. After several seconds, Birdy does not surface. A worried Al yells for Birdy, but can't do anything about it as Al doesn't know how to swim.Al, Birdy and their dates Shirley (Sandra Beall) and Rosanne (Elizabeth Whitcraft) are on a miniature roller coaster. Birdy is half standing up, flapping his arms like a bird.As they wander around the amusement park, Al is interested in the girls while Birdy sees them more as a distraction. They stop at the underwater merman, Birdy who wonders how he can hold his breath so long. Later, Al and Shirley are noisily having sex in the grass, while Birdy and Rosanne, nearby, make small talk. After a few seconds, Rosanne can no longer stand being with the ""weird"" Birdy and yanks Shirley away from the sex to head off. Birdy is nonplussed, while Al is angry.At the beach the next day, Birdy is flapping his arms like a bird jumping around, while Al yells to him that he has to learn to get along with girls in a normal way, which means no bird talk. They argue about the female form, Birdy seeing women's breasts as no more than enlarged mammary glands, whereas Al sees beauty. A policeman approaches them, asking if the 1953 Ford is their car. At the police station, Al and Birdy are behind bars waiting for Al's parents to show up. Birdy is pacing while Al is calm. The Columbatos arrive to pick up the boys. As Al gets to the car, Mr. Columbato slaps him hard across the face. Al winces and starts to cry. Birdy asks what birds looking down must think of their lives. Mr. Columbato is angry at the banter, at the boys and the fact that the car engine won't start. The four are then seen from a bird's eye view.[Forward to present day] Al is let into Birdy's hospital room, the door locked behind him. Birdy is crouched on the floor and Al sits across from him. Al starts having a conversation with himself, speaking both his and Birdy's parts. He stops the dialogue and yells at Birdy to talk to him. Al tells Birdy he knows he's finally a bird and that it's no big deal, except that he will be used as a medical case history forever. Birdy turns his head and looks out the window. It's a heavily overcast day with a glint of sunshine filtering through the clouds.[Flashback to high school years] It's a rainy day and Birdy is headed to see Mrs. Prevost (Nancy Fish) who sells birds out of her house. Birds are flying everywhere in the room. Birdy takes a liking to a yellow canary which he buys. He names her Birda.Al and Birdy are moving what looks to be a large pair of wings. They're discussing the fact that Mr. Columbato sold their car, which Birdy wants. Al tries to dissuade him from talking to Mr. Columbato as Al knows his father will beat Birdy if he makes a fuss about the car. Birdy confronts Mr. Columbato about the issue. They argue long and hard about it. Mr. Columbato, at the end of his rope, at least offers the money back to Birdy. That's not the point to Birdy, but Mrs. Columbato makes Birdy take the money. A dejected Birdy takes the money, walks away and gives the entire wad of cash to Al as Birdy doesn't want the money, just the car.[Forward to present day] Al is admiring the fact that Birdy stood up to Mr. Columbato, something Al himself could never do. Al, confused about their current life, gets up to leave but not before giving Birdy a caress on the cheek. There is no reaction from Birdy. With the door locked, Al pounds on the door and yells for Renaldi to unlock it. As Renaldi rushes to unlock the door for Al, Birdy registers some fear from the knocking. Al yells out for Birdy as he reminisces about being in the jungle in Vietnam.Al wakens from a nightmare. He is in the hospital and Renaldi rushes over to him. Al is almost out of breath, but Renaldi sees it is a panic attack and nothing physically wrong.Major Weiss' secretary is taking some information from Al regarding Al himself for the major. The secretary is constantly spitting. Al is confused about why they need his personal medical history. Although the officer has not yet collected all the information, Weiss calls Al into his office with the secretary bringing in Al's file. Al's first question is about the secretary's spitting. Weiss replies that he has been that way since combat, which left a bad taste in his mouth. Al learns that Weiss wants his information as he wants to know who he's dealing with. Weiss reads about some insubordination on Al's part while in Vietnam, specifically a physical attack on a senior officer. Al gets the topic back to Birdy. They talk about the car, and the fact that Al's father reported it stolen when the boys drove it to Atlantic City. Weiss yells at Al for his wisecrack remarks. Weiss tells him that wise-crackers like him and Birdy usually end up institutionalized forever, but Al is certain that with time he can get through to his friend. Before Al leaves the room, he lies to the Major about his feelings toward his father in general and about the incident with the car.As Hannah caresses Birdy's face, Al tries to feed him. Birdy starts to eat. Hannah has to leave and asks Al to finish feeding Birdy. After Hannah leaves, Al tells Birdy that he thinks she likes him. Al then tells him to stop the act as it's making him crazy and might risk his life being institutionalized forever. Birdy stops eating but starts staring at Al. He's not sure if it is recognition or not.[Flashback to high school years] Birdy is lying in bed, playing with a mechanical bird he made. Birda flies onto his arm. After playing with her, he places her in the aviary he's built under his bed. Birdy's father comes into his room and tells him to go to sleep at it's 3 o'clock in the morning. Birdy's mom yells the same off from the distance. Birdy's father turns off the light and closes the door. Birda chirps.In class, Birdy is giving a verbal presentation on birds using his mechanical bird as a demonstration. The class is most enthralled with aspects of flying as they watch the mechanical bird fly around the room. Laughter erupts when the bird hits the window and crashes. As Birdy picks up the bird, one girl, Doris Robinson (Maude Winchester) gives Birdy a loving look which he notices. Later, Al mentions Doris' look to Birdy. Birdy doesn't seem interested in pursuing anything with Doris.Birdy heads to the school's basement to talk to his father who works there as a janitor. Birdy wants him to talk to his mother about letting him have a male canary to mate with Birda. Birdy's dad isn't so sure it's a good idea. He feels Birdy's mom thinks that canaries and Al as a friend won't get him far in life. He likens it to his own growing up situation, Birdy's dad's passion which was building things out of wicker. Birdy's dad and mom want to get him interested in something practical. But Birdy really wants this second canary, so Birdy's dad gives in to the idea of at least broaching the issue with his mom.Back in Birdy's bedroom, there are two canaries flying around, Birda in the general aviary, the male in a cage in the aviary. This will allow the two to get familiar with each other without having physical interaction until they are comfortable with each other. Al enters the room and notices the second bird. Birdy has named it Alfonso as it likes to fight and show off. Both Al and Birdy are enthralled watching the two. When Birdy starts making canary noises, Al looks at him like he's crazy.Al and Birdy are in Birdy's back yard lifting weights. Birdy is face down flapping his arms and legs mimicking flying. Birdy's mom tells them they're crazy. Al's retort is that she's crazy for hiding their baseballs. They surmise she's buried them somewhere. An alarm goes off. They've been weightlifting for an hour. Birdy admits he's doing this weightlifting so that he can fly.Al and Birdy are at the garbage dump. Birdy is saving a gull from a rat snake. As Birdy picks up the bird to let it fly away, he gets a stick to stab the snake to death. Al wants them to get on with their task as it smells there, but Birdy is in no hurry as he paces off a distance. Al is on Birdy's bike, while Birdy, who has just put on his home made wings, sits on the bike's handlebars. Birdy is certain this venture will work. Al starts pedaling as fast as he can. Birdy starts flapping his wings. Just before the drop-off, Al stops which propels Birdy into the air. Birdy takes flight for a fraction of a second before he starts to plummet to the ground. He lands in a cesspool below. Al rushes down to him as the weight of the wings is submerging Birdy under the shallow water. Birdy, not knowing what went wrong, is otherwise OK.[Forward to present day] Al is back in Birdy's hospital room. Al makes a joke about their relationship. Birdy smiles, which Al notices. Later Al tells Weiss about the smile. Weiss believes the smile is dissociative to the joke. Weiss, frustrated with Al, says that Birdy is more responsive to drug treatment than to him. Al yells back that the drugs are making Birdy not who he is. Weiss, Al's superior officer, won't tolerate Al's insubordination like he is aware Al is apt to be as he read through in his file. Al apologizes if only to be able to help Birdy. Weiss suggests that Al is no longer needed and that he should return to Fort Dix. As Weiss walks off, Al suggests one other thing from the past that may twig some memory in Birdy: the missing baseballs. He wants the army to ask Birdy's mom to send the baseballs. Weiss agrees to extend Al's visit until he can check about the baseballs.Al enters a gymnasium in the hospital where a wheelchair bound patient is dribbling and shooting hoops. Al claps in appreciation. The patient asks Al to join in. Al declines to go lift weights instead. He watches another legless man climbing rope. Al reminisces about how the war has been so different than they imagined it would be, and how immature they have been. As he continues his reminiscences, he goes to see that Hannah is giving Birdy a bath.[Flashback to high school years] Al and Birdy are in a truck with Joe Sagessa (Robert L. Ryan) who catches stray dogs and sells them. The guys want in on the business to make money. They spot a dog. They stop and get their equipment to catch the dog, Joe with a large hoop net, the boys with a large loose net. As they approach the dog, they see a herd of other dogs off in the distance. They all smell a war. As Joe tries to catch the original dog, it runs off, the other dogs fast on their tail. The guys get back into the truck to chase after the entire herd. They believe they have the dogs cornered against a chain link fence. They manage to catch most of the dogs and put them in the cage in the back of the truck. They drive off with the dogs, Joe telling them that he will deal with the dogs' disposal. Then a car approaches them from the side. The angry driver yells that his dog is in the back of Joe's truck. The angry driver tries to side swipe the truck. As the chase continues, Joe won't stop as he says they're almost at their destination: an abattoir, where the animals are electrocuted. The angry driver gets there just after the guys, the angry driver clamoring to get his dog back. Birdy attacks Joe and yells to Al to let the dogs go. Al unlocks the cage as the dogs run out. The angry driver is able to get his dog and he drives off. Al and Birdy run off away from an angry Joe.[Forward to present day] Hannah is still giving Birdy his bath. Al watches through the door window. Birdy is remembering back to a time in his past when a cat was approaching. He starts to thrash around in the bathtub scared. Hannah does not know why Birdy is in this scared state.[Flashback to high school years] Birdy is in his kitchen, washing a picture frame in the sink. He sees that specific cat outside, not really paying it much attention. Unknown to him, the cat makes it into the house and up into his bedroom. Finished his task in the kitchen, Birdy heads up to his room, but not before his mother complains about the birds attracting lice. In his room, he sees the cat with Birda in its mouth. Birdy lunges at the cat and tries to pry its mouth open. An angry Birdy manages to do so and grab the injured Birda as the cat runs off. Birdy has Birda cupped in his hands, caressing it. She isn't moving. All of a sudden, she begins to move, gets up and flies off. An excited Birdy watches her fly around the room.[Forward to present day] Birdy is staring out the window. Al, in the room, tells his friend that he won't give up on him. He admits he almost told Weiss about Birdy's flying. Al grabs Birdy off the floor, violently pushes him up against the wall, and yells at him to snap out of his condition. Al throws him back down on the floor and tells him to at least be consistent: he may try to act like a bird, but everything he is now doing is not bird-like. Hannah enters with a tray of food. Al continues to taunt Birdy, who is obviously reacting. Hannah yells at Al to stop, cradling a scared Birdy in her arms, but Al knows that he's tapped into something in Birdy's psyche. Al yells at Hannah about her inopportune entrance as he storms out of the room. Hannah follows Al into another private room and she sympathetically apologizes to him about the argument that just occurred. Al begins to feel her breasts and they start to kiss. Al quickly stops what he's doing, thinking more about how they can help Birdy than about the tenderness of the current situation. Al walks off leaving an emotional Hannah behind. Al goes into the bathroom, turns on the light and stares in the mirror. He begins to examine underneath the bandages on his face.It's dusk and Birdy, in his room, is naked, perched on the bed's foot-board like a bird.[Flashback to high school years] Birdy is staring at one of the canaries in its cage.It's nighttime, and a large shadow of a flapping bird is on the side of the building. Birdy, in over voice, is telling of his dream, where he and Birda become one. Birdy suddenly awakens from his dream. He looks down and realizes he's had a wet dream. He grabs a towel and wipes himself off.Birdy is examining the eggs Birda has laid as one begins to hatch. He realizes that what is happening is nature at work, but he is still amazed at the magic occurring before him, when all he did was put two birds together and feed them. He now has four canaries. All he now cares about is what is happening in his room in the aviary.Scenes cut between present day, with Birdy still perched like a bird on the foot-board of his hospital room bed, and his high school days, specifically focusing on the baby canaries. Birdy, in voice over, tells how the babies seem to know their place in the world.[Flashback to high school years] The phone is ringing. Birdy's mom enters his room, where Birdy, in only his briefs, is sitting on a chair, staring off into space. It's Doris on the phone, wanting to go to the prom with Birdy. Birdy's mom swears she'll kill him if he doesn't go with Doris rather than waste his time alone in his room as usual. She tells him to get rid of the birds as she leaves the room.At the prom, Birdy and Doris are slow dancing. Birdy seems to be in another world which a confused Doris notices. Al, dancing next to them, mimics for Birdy to take some romantic actions with Doris. Cutting to a fast song, they are still dancing. Birdy sees his father off in the distance. Birdy leaves to look for his father and leaves a confused and slightly embarrassed Doris to dance by herself. Birdy finds his father in one of the school's hallways, he who is mopping the floor. Birdy's father gives him a little money to take ""his pretty girl"" out somewhere after the dance. As Birdy's father heads off, Birdy tells him matter-of-factly that she's not his girl.Doris drives Birdy into a packed but quiet parking lot. She turns off the motor and sidles closer to Birdy. She thanks him for the wrist corsage, which she will keep as a memento. As she extends her hand out, Birdy removes the corsage. She also thanks him for taking her to the prom, which she knows he didn't want to do, but as a thank you, he can now have what he wants. She begins to remove the bodice of her dress, exposing her bare breasts. Birdy feels one of the breasts, more like it's a ball than part of a woman he wants to make love to. He stops. She again feels embarrassed, and pulls her dress back on, apologizing. They look into another car and see a couple making out. They wonder how they do it. As they are about to drive off, Doris makes it clear she wants to go out on another date. Birdy says he'll see her in school, not quite realizing that is not what she was asking.Birdy enters his bedroom. After he closes the door behind him, he begins to slowly disrobe. Totally naked, Birdy enters the aviary and crouches on the floor as he watches the canaries. He eventually lies down and one of the birds lands on his shoulder. He slowly grabs Birda in his hands, and brings it to his mouth as he begins to gently kiss her. In a semi-conscious state, he starts dreaming that there are several birds around him. He wants to tell Al of his dreams but is afraid to. There is nothing left in the real world to keep him alive. He wants to die and be born again as a bird. Still in an unconscious but excited state, he imagines himself flying around his room, then throughout the house, then around outside in the neighborhood, finally hovering over the make-shift baseball diamond.[Forward to present day] Al brings Birdy a tray of food. As Al tries to feed him, Birdy does not respond. Al apologizes for his behavior from before. Al leaves the tray of food next to Birdy, but before he leaves, he tells Birdy that he has to come back to reality.[Flashback to Vietnam] As a helicopter flies overhead, Al and another soldier are in a swampy area below. The other soldier, screaming, is badly wounded. Al yells into the distance that the soldier has been hit as more soldiers run toward them. As they approach, a bomb explodes. Screaming, Al grabs his bloodied face in agony.[Forward to present day] Al, crying, goes back to Birdy's room and stares at him through the door window. Al sits on the floor outside the door in a bad state.[Flashback to Vietnam] The helicopter lands. Several wounded soldiers, including Al, are helped onto the helicopter.[Forward to present day] Al, asleep, is lying on the floor outside of Birdy's room. Renaldi comes by with a suitcase. Al asks what it is. Renaldi replies that he doesn't know but that it came from Birdy's mother. An excited Al brings the suitcase into Birdy's room. He thinks the baseballs will get a reaction from Birdy. As Al opens the suitcase, the baseballs roll all over the floor. Birdy, lying on the floor, has no reaction. A disappointed Al starts to kick the balls in frustration, knowing that his own mental state is tenuous and if Weiss really knew what was going on in his head, he too would be institutionalized. He tells Birdy that he is more scared now than he was in the war, where he was more scared than anyone he knew there. Al sits down among the balls in frustration.[Flashback to high school years] Al enters Birdy's bedroom looking for him. He sees Birdy naked on the floor of the aviary. Al believes that Birdy's undressed state has something to do with having a good time with Doris. As Birdy starts to get dressed, Al asks for details about Doris. Instead, Birdy tells Al about his experience with flying last night, not like a bird, but as a bird. Angry, Al tells Birdy to stop these stupid fantasies as he storms out of the room.[Forward to present day] Still amidst the baseballs, Al apologizes to Birdy for saying those things about Birdy's flying and storming out. Weiss enters. Al gets up, takes Weiss outside the room and tells him the baseballs are working but that he needs a little more time. Weiss disagrees as Birdy is deteriorating. Al's time is up.[Flashback to high school years] Birdy is in his bedroom looking out the window to Al who is wearing an army uniform and carrying a duffel bag as he walks away. One of the canaries crawls under the open crack of the window and flies outside. Birdy yells for it to come back as it flies around outside. Birdy is madly trying to pry the window fully open without success. As Birdy continues trying to get the window open, the canary comes back and smashes into the closed window as Birdy screams. Birdy grabs the bird from the windowsill and caresses it in his hands. Its neck appears to be broken. Birdy weeps.Al is running down to street and boards a bus as it takes off.Birdy is in a fetal position on the floor of his bedroom. He is still in tears.[Flashback to Vietnam] A helicopter is flying over the jungle. Aboard are several soldiers, including an injured one screaming in pain. Birdy is aboard. The helicopter crashes. In the aftermath, there seems to be few if any survivors except an injured Birdy, who is sitting, leaning against a fallen tree. He sees a tropical bird and points up at it. A flock of birds fly overhead. There is a sound of a jet. A bomb is dropped within close vicinity. Much of the jungle goes up in flames. Although not directly in the flames, Birdy screams in a panic. He continues screaming as more birds fly overhead. There are several dead soldiers in the immediate area.[Forward to present day] Birdy is on the floor of his room crying. Al walks over to him, holds his head and tells him it's OK.Hannah enters the room. She is there as Weiss asked for Al as he should now leave the institution for good. Al is on the floor, with Birdy in his arms. Al refuses to leave until Birdy is OK. After Hannah leaves to tell Weiss, Al confesses to Birdy that they are both in a bad mental state and that life has got the better of them. Al wanted to do whatever he wanted to do in life, but that the authorities in charge will now dictate what happens to them. Al remembers back to when he was injured and the different feelings he had in being able to smell his burning flesh and not being able to do anything about it. He is scared that he won't recognize himself once the bandages are removed, and in not recognizing himself if he has lost his sense of who he is. He believes he may now be what the army wants him to be. As Al now wants to hide underneath the bandages forever, he understands that what Birdy is now doing is his own form of hiding from the world. Birdy then says, ""Al, sometimes you're so full of shit."" An excited Al realizes that Birdy said something and that the words he heard were not his imagination. After Al asking him why, Birdy says him talking now was not a conscious decision, but something that just happened. Weiss enters and wonders what is going on. Al tells him that Birdy spoke, this being the first time that Al has used the nickname ""Birdy"" in front of Weiss. Weiss doesn't believe it as Birdy looks the same, not uttering a word. When Weiss tries to get Al to leave, Al grabs him and pushes him against the wall. After Al lets go of him, Weiss runs out of the room. Al asks Birdy why he didn't say anything to Weiss, Birdy's response being that he had nothing to say to him. Two orderlies rush in trying to subdue Al. He manages to beat up both. Al grabs Birdy as the two run out of the room. With the orderlies on their tail, Al and Birdy head up the stairs toward the roof. As Al barricades the door of the roof behind them, Birdy runs toward the edge of the roof. Birdy raises his arms and jumps off the side of the roof like he is about ready to fly. Al yells for Birdy to stop. Al, stopping the barricading, runs over to the edge from where Birdy jumped. He looks down, expecting to see Birdy dead on the ground below. Instead, Birdy is on another level of the roof, only a few feet down, perfectly fine. Birdy looks up at Al and asks quizzically of Al, ""What?"""

The Perils of Gwendoline in the Land of the Yik Yak,1984,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087903/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Gwendoline, a runaway nun, arrives in Hong Kong on a mission to find her father, who was last seen in the legendary Land of the Yik Yak searching for a rare butterfly. She's guided on her perilous journey by the selfish mercenary Willard. Gwendoline arrives in China in a box, and is helped out of her immediate predicament by a female contact and a devil-may-care adventurer. She's on a mission to find her father, who was last seen searching for a rare butterfly in the Land of the Yik Yak. They confront the evil Cheops in an attempt to find Gwen's lost father and the butterfly, and face many other challenges to their mission.—Ed Sutton <esutton@mindspring.com> The story starts at a Far East port where a ship from Europe is unloading its cargo. Thieves move among the recently unloaded crates looking for something valuable to steal. In one large crate they are surprised to find Gwendoline (Tawny Kitaen), a beautiful, naive, young French girl who, lacking the money for a proper passenger cabin, had herself and her companion, Beth (Zabou Breitman), shipped by freight to this city. Beth, slightly older than Gwendoline and more experienced, is not in the crate, but is currently out trying to steal some food for the girls to eat.The thieves kidnap Gwendoline and take her to a local gangster chief's office above his casino/bordello. They sell Gwendoline to him and leave. Gwendoline is then accidentally saved by Willard (Brent Huff), a local riverboat captain to whom the gangster owes $800, when Willard crashes into the gangster's office and demands his money. Gwendoline is impressed with Willard, being both handsome and capable, as he quickly incapacitates the gangster's two bodyguard and extracts his money from the gangster chief (but also mortally wounding him in the process). She begs him for further assistance, but he ignores her and heads down to the casino below.The thieves return at this point, having captured Beth and hoping to also sell her. When they enter the office and see the gangster and his body guards incapacitated, they assume Gwendoline has bested them and the thieves flee in terror, leaving Beth behind.
The girls head down to the casino and Gwendoline again seeks the assistance of Willard who is at the roulette table. She tells him she is looking for her father, an entomologist who disappeared seeking a rare butterfly in these parts. Willard and his companions scoff at the idea that anybody would waste their time searching for butterflies, but Gwendoline seizes some of his chips, places them on black and makes a bet with him that he wins, he must help them, if not, they will go away and stop bothering him.The roulette ball lands on black and Willard agrees to help get them started with their search for Gwendoline's dad. He takes the girls to a notorious opium den to talk to an acquaintance of his that might know about her father. The girls are shocked to find the acquaintance mostly stoned with opium laying naked on a bed while a young girl pleasures him as they talk. The acquaintance informs them he had spoken to Gwendoline's father, and that he was headed to the Yik-Yak, a desert area up river and inland across the jungle. He informs them that the area is dangerous and nobody has ever returned from it.As they leave the den, the local police chief arrests them: Willard for the gangster's murder and the girls for not having a passport. Once in a cell, Willard seizes Gwendoline and roughly kisses her, trying to get her to scream and create a diversion for their escape. Gwendoline, however, melts in his arms and he is forced to slap her on her behind to get her to yell. This brings the guard. Willard overpowers him, gets the keys and the three escape.Willard has an agreement with a local smuggler to carry contraband up river, with the contraband delivered to his boat the next morning. The girls beg to go with him and he throws them into the river. The next morning, waking up, he is frustrated to find they are again on his boat and again he throws them into the river. The girls inform him, however, that as he slept, they took receipt of his contraband and if he wants it back, we will have to take them with him. He reluctantly agrees.When they arrive at the trading post where Gwendoline's father must have started his inland trip, Gwendoline faints when she sees that the man that runs the outpost, Tom, is wearing her father's jacket and hat. Tom explains that he found them on a body (Gwen's father) on the bank of the river. Tom at first believed the man was a victim of the Klops, a primitive tribe that lives in the jungle between the river and the Yik-Yak, but was puzzled when the saw the man died by a bullet wound, because the Klops have no guns.With her father dead, Willard sees no reason for Gwendoline to continue her expedition, but Gwendoline decides she has a new mission: to capture the butterfly herself and see it named after her father. Willard refuses to participate until she offers him $2,000 to help (though Beth and Willard fail to see how she will acquire that much money). Secretly she raises it by selling Willard's contraband to Tom, who is willing to risk Willard's wrath as he thinks it is unlikely that the three of them will return from the Yik-Yak.The three head into the jungle, but after a few days are captured by the Klops and taken to their village, where they are hogtied overnight in a hut to await their fate. Gwendoline asks what will happen to them. Willard informs her that the Klops fear a deadly and putrid wind that blows in from the Yik-Yak, and when it occurs he will be scarified by being tied to scaffolding at the border of the desert to appease the wind. The girl's fate will be more immediate, however, as tomorrow they will be used for sport and the Yik-Yak will hunt them to death with their dogs.Gwendoline laments that she will die a virgin, never having been made love to by a man. To calm her Willard describes how he would make love to her, exciting her only with words until she has an orgasm.Over the course of the night, Beth manages to loosen Willard's bonds with her teeth, so when Gwendoline screams, bringing a guard, Willard is able to overpower him and they escape. Chased by the Klops, they flee into the Yik-Yak desert where the Klops fear to enter. That night the deadly wind comes, but the three survive it and the next day Gwendoline shouts that she has seen this place in her dreams and over the next sand dune is where the butterfly lives. Willard and Beth at first think the deadly wind has affected her mind, but soon discover she is right finding a rocky rift in the desert floor with dense vegetation at the bottom. Beth is lowered down and quickly finds and captures the rare butterfly, but before she can be brought back up, there is a scream from below, and Beth is gone.Gwendoline and Willard climb down to find Beth. They discover that adjacent to the jungle and the bottom of the rift is a partly underground city, made of white stone. Observing the inhabitants from hiding, they see that apparently the population is composed only of attractive females. They seem to be divided into three classes: the workers, who only wear only sandals and a brief thong as they work the macabre machines that seem to power the city; the warriors/guards, who wear similar thongs, but with boots, breast plates, spears and helmets; and finally the ruling class, led by the queen (Bernadette Lafont), who sport elaborate makeup and long, fancy robes that cover them to their ankles. The guards and elite use chariots to get around the city, not drawn by horses, but by the lower class women.Gwendoline and Willard manage to get a hold of guard uniforms and disguise themselves so they can search the city (a disguise which is of limited effectiveness for Willard as the skimpy outfit does not hide his maleness very well). Willard realizes that the machines are being used to collect and process diamonds, which are probably smuggled to the outside world in order to pay for the rich ruling class's lifestyles.
The guards become suspicious of Willard and Gwendoline and they are chased about the city. They become separated and Gwen finds herself in a torture chamber where women who have defied the queen are being punished. She finds Beth there, strapped to the wall in front of a giant crossbow with a plug in her mouth. If Beth opens her mouth just a tiny bit the plug, attached to a string, will be pulled out, and this will trigger the crossbow causing her to be impaled. Gwendoline is able to free one of Beth's arms, allowing her to dodge the spear when it is released from the bow. Before they can flee, however, the Queen and her guards appear and Gwen is taken to a room where the Queen can interrogate her.The Queen, intrigued by Gwendoline's beauty, explains the history of the city which is named Pikaho. It was located on a volcano which erupted in the 12th century, killing most of the population, and the few of the men that survived soon died of unknown causes. Since then the inhabitants have been nearly all women, with a few men brought into allow selected girls to mate and continue the population. At this point Willard arrives, trying to rescue Gwen. He is captured, and given that he appears to be a fine specimen, the Queen will allow four of her best girls to compete to mate with him.The Queen also introduces Gwen to D'Arcy (Jean Rougerie), a male scientist from the outside world whose machines, powered by the volcano, run the city and allow them to mine the diamonds.Gwen and Beth are chained in a room for disobedient girls, but manage to overpower the guard and escape. Gwen tries to rescue Willard resulting in a chariot race with Willard and Gwen being pursued by the guards (and all the chariots pulled by scantily clad women). The race ends in a crash, Willard is recaptured and one of the Queen's guards (who also happens to be one selected to compete to mate with Willard) traps Gwen at a cliff edge. Before the guard can spear Gwendoline, however, Beth appears and manages to crush the guard's head with a rock. Beth then tells Gwen to take the guard's helmet (which conceals her face) and spear, and push the body over the cliff. When the Queen arrives, she assumes the body at the bottom of the cliff is Gwendoline and she and sends the now disguised Gwen with D'Arcy to prepare for the contest.D'Arcy sees through the disguise and when he is left alone with Gwendoline, he confesses to her he hates being under the Queen's thumb and plans to use his machines to create an volcanic eruption destroying the city. He begs Gwendoline to escape with him, as he lusts after her beauty, but she refuses.Disguised as the guard, Gwen enters a fight to the death with three other girls for the right to mate with Willard. Despite not being trained for combat, she knows it is the only way for her to save his life as the woman he will mate will kill him after he gives her his seed.
Gwen avoids combat with the other three girls, letting them fight among themselves until she only has a single opponent left. At this point, girls carrying shields for the combatants enter the fight. Gwen's shield is carried by Beth, and together they manage to defeat Gwen's final opponent.With her head still hidden by the helmet, Gwen is led to the throne room where Willard, spread eagle on his back and chained to a bed, is forced to mate with her (the actual mating hidden by a long robe Gwen's has been given). As the mating reaches its climax, the throne room is shaken by the volcano's eruption, caused by D'Arcy and his machines.
Gwen finally removes her helmet, letting the Queen see her identity. The Queen is unable to take any action against Gwen or Willard, however, as a new tremor causes her throne to collapse.Gwen, Willard, and Beth flee the city, but as they pass the room where the diamonds were being processed, Willard declares he will not leave without getting something for all the trouble they've been put through and enters the room. Gwen begs him to come back, but a falling rock closes the path between them and the girls realize they will have to escape from the crumbling city without his help.
By the time they make it out of the crevasse, only a small hole in the sand marks where the city once stood and they seem to be the only survivors. Gwen cries, thinking Willard is dead, but looks up to find him grinning and holding the long sought after butterfly in a cage. The three of them then start their trek out of the desert and back to civilization.The End."

She clears customs with ease, apparently carrying a baby in her arms. A blue retro Cadillac is waiting for her outside the terminal and she gets in. It is shown that the ""baby"" is actually a doll packed with high-grade cocaine. The woman is driven back to the two drug-runners low-rent apartment located in a large boarding house near downtown Miami. In a van near the house, there are two people staking it out. They are Frances Hudson (Lisa Blount) a local reporter, and her cameraman Mark Ludman (Leonardo Manzella) whom are hoping to film an impeding arrest by the DEA and broadcast it live on TV for ratings for their low-key TV station. But minutes later, when they enter the apartment, they find a bloodbath. Both drug dealers and the woman are dead, with the woman's legs spread-eagled and pinned to the floor in the same manner as shown in the opening scenes. Fran looks around and finds a photo of a group of drug dealers loading drugs onto a plane.Running from the scene before the police arrive, Fran and Mark go to talk to Fargas (Eriq LaSalle), an informant who manages a local strip club, where she shows him the photo and can't shake the feeling that one of the men in the photo looks familiar. Fargas then hints of them about the Jim Jones set. Fran and Mark return to their employers at Cable Video News where they talk with the station owner Bob Allo (Richard Bright) and their supervisor Karin (Karen Black) about their leads in the case of the massacre of several drug dealers all over the USA that has been going on for the past several weeks. After viewing old videotape footage of Jonestown in 1978 on the day prior to the mass suicide, Fran sees the mysterious Colonel Horne in one frame of the newsreel. Since Horne was said to have died in Jonestown, and the photo of him found in the drug dealers apartment is only a few months old, Fran becomes determined to find Horne and get a personal interview with him. But also in the photograph is a certain Tommy Allo (Willie Aames) the long-lost son of Bob Allo, whom disappeared into the jungles of South America nearly 10 years earlier. Desperate to be reunited with his son, Bob Allo equips Fran and Mark with expensive live broadcast equipment to keep track of their progress and sends them off. Fran's search for the plane in the photo leads them to a pilot named Tony Martina (Carlos De Carvalho) who agrees to fly them to Venezuela where he claimed that the drug dealers in the photo took him to.Meanwhile in the jungles somewhere in southern Venezuela, Tommy Allo, with a guide in tow, attempts to flee from the jungle only to get re-captured by Vlado (John Steiner), a sadistic Russian who operates a drug-producing facility near a large dirt airstrip. He tells the youth not to try to run away again and help them with their work. Tommy is taken back to the camp where he meets with Ana (Valentina Forte) whom is the radio operator and den mother to the camp. When a plane arrives with some food and supplies for the smugglers, Vlado persuades the pilot friend of his to ""have his way"" with Ana. After the smuggler semi-rapes Ana and leaves, Tommy comforts Ana and persuades her to help him try to escape again when night falls.But that evening, while Tommy is setting up the landing strip for the arrival of the plane carrying Fran and Mark, by setting afire runway lights, Colonel Horne's hit squad of Indios, led once again by Quecho, arrive and attacks. Vlado manages to flee into the jungle while most of his men are killed. Tommy is attacked on the airstrip by one Indio, whom he shoots dead and also flees into the jungle. The plane with Fran and Mark aboard lands, but soon is hit with poison darts fired by the natives in which the pilot is killed.After hiding out all night on the plane, Fran and Mark venture outside at daylight to the scene of appalling carnage of the remains of the drug camp. But the only person that's alive is Ana whom they find hiding in a locker. She tells them that Tommy Allo, whom they ask about, has also escaped the carnage and she can direct them to another drug facility nearby which is the residence of the shadowy Colonel Horne. With fuel in the plane on the runway at empty, Fran and Mark have no choice but to follow Ana into the jungle. In the jungle, Tommy comes upon the sight of Vlado, having been tied up with both of his legs to two different trees, begging Tommy to shoot him. But before Tommy can react, Vlado is gruesomely torn apart when the two trees uplift, splitting him in two.Back in Miami, Karin oversees the broadcast footage that Fran and Mark shoot, while Bob Allo goes off to question Fargus for the whereabouts of his son. Fargus, for a large fee of money, agrees to look into it. Later that day, Fargus at a local train station, makes a call to Allo where he gives him the information that he needs that Colonel Horne may have a camp near the town of Rio Negro in southern Venezuela. But just then, two assassins (apparently from Colonel Horne's payroll) appear and murder Fargus by throwing him in front of a moving train. Allo leaves Miami quickly for Venezuela to check out the leads.Back in Venezuela, Fran, Mark, and Ana hike into the jungle in search for help, while Quecho and his Indios follow, but for some reason keep their distance and only harass them with various Indios traps. When Ana wonders off into the jungle to relieve herself, she is found the next day by Fran and Mark having been murdered. Forced to continue, Fran and Mark arrive later that day at the destroyed drugs-producing facility where the opening massacre took place. There, they find Tommy Allo in hiding there and they agree to take a boat upriver to Colonel Horne's camp. During the journey, while filming more scenery of the area, they are all captured by Quecho and his men and taken to Colonel Horne's camp.Meanwhile, Bob Allo arrives by plane in southern Venezuela where he meets with his contact Bud (Luca Barbareschi) who agrees to try to find Colonel Horne's camp in the jungle by flying helicopters over the area. During the patrol, they find Colonel Horne's camp where the Colonel himself fires at the chopper with a rifle. Bud's men fire back, and hit Colonel Horne in the chest. But with fuel running low, Bud has no choice but to return to their base, but promise Allo that they will return in the next day in greater numbers.At Colonel Horne's camp, Fran, Mark, and Tommy are tied up on X-shaped crosses and beaten by the Indios. Colonel Horne, aware that he may be fatally wounded from the helicopter encounter, tells his men that they are striking camp the next day and moving out. That evening, Horne has Fran cut down from her painful crucifixion position and asks her why she came to find him. Fran explains that she just wants an interview about why he is still alive and what his plans are. Colonel Horne explains that he is determined to follow in the footsteps of his late master, Jim Jones, by controlling the world's cocaine market, claiming that he plans to destroy the weak by helping to corrupt them with cocaine, in the process of freeing humanity of its self-indulgence, purifying it once and for all. But he agrees to let them live until tomorrow to broadcast his statement.The next day, while Allo and Bud, with a platoon of troops in several helicopters take off to Colonel Horne's camp, the Colonel releases Fran, Mark, and Tommy to film his political statement to the camera crew. Aware that he may be dying, Colonel Horne explains that there are no answers to his works, only actions, for his actions can either be judges pure or unholy. Colonel Horne, as a political statement, orders his right-hand man to behead him right in front of the entire camp. Taking advantage of this chaos, Mark, Fran and Tommy break free and run to Colonel Horne's floatplane. A gun battle begins as the three of them arm themselves with rifles and take on Colonel Horne's Indios killing several of them including Horne's right hand man. Just then, Allo and Bud arrive in a fleet of helicopters where they rain gunfire on the camp, killing many Indios and forcing the rest to flee into the jungle.When the helicopters land to mop up the area, Tommy runs from the floatplane where he is at last reunited with his father. When Mr. Allo and Tommy leave in Bud's helicopter back to their base, Fran and Mark take off in Horne's floatplane for the long flight back to Miami. But in the final sequence, Quecho, hiding aboard Horne's plane, attacks them in mid-flight. But Fran fights back first by disorienting Quecho with a foam fire extinguisher and killing him at last with a rifle. Now relived that it's over, Fran and Mark fly back to Miami."

Repentance,1984,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093754/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Varlam, the despotic mayor of a small town, dies. After his funeral, his body is repeatedly unearthed and buried again. Through flashbacks and dreamlike scenes, we witness his rise, power and ambiguities. The day after the funeral of Varlam Aravidze, the mayor of a small Georgian town, his corpse turns up in his son's garden and is secretly reburied. But the corpse keeps returning, and the police eventually capture a local woman, who is accused of digging it up. She says that Varlam should never be laid to rest because he was responsible for a Stalin-like reign of terror that led to the disappearance of many of her friends...—Michael Brooke <michael@everyman.demon.co.uk> The film Repentance begins with a woman baking cakes designed to look like churches and moments later discovering that a man, Varlam Aravidze, has died. It's rather obvious that she isn't sorrowful over the death, unlike her male companion who cries that he was ""a great man"". The film moves forward to Varlam's funeral, with a line of people moving before Varlam's family and sharing their condolences. Varlam's grandson is the only one who seems genuinely saddened by his passing. Following his funeral and burial, Varlam's corpse is soon unearthed and propped up against the tree outside his son, Abel's, residence, much to the family's horror. In response the authorities arrest Varlam's corpse. At the advice of his ""fool"" neighbor, Abel decides to rebury Varlam but to contract a cage around his grave. The next morning Varlam's corpse in unearthed once again and sat casually at a table in Abel's backyard. After this the police stand guard overnight and quickly discover the culprit responsible- it's the woman who was baking cakes at the start of the film. We find out that the woman's name is Keti Barateli, and she was the daughter of an artist named Sandro and his beautiful wife, Nino. Keti recalls Varlam being elected mayor when she was 8 and her father taking issue with Varlam's use of their ancient church for experiments that are ruining the infrastructure of the cathedral. Sandro argues that the destruction of the church means the destruction of the history and culture that give life to their people. He says destroy the church, ""then throw into fire the works of Rustaveli and Dante! Stop playing Bach, Beethoven, Verdi. Let's demolish the St. Peter Church, Notre Dame, Svetitskhoveli."" Varlam appears to give in a bit to those imploring him to maintain the safety of the church but then threatens Sandro by casually informing him he know's where he lives and saw his young daughter (8 year old Keti) blowing bubbles during his mayoral parade. He then proceeds to arrest the two people who had joined Sandro to argue on behalf of the church, but shortly after it is said that they were released. Varlam then show's up at Sandro's apartment and hits on his wife and gives Keti some birds before sending her off to play with his son Abel. Varlam begins to tell Sandro that he needs and artist like him to enlighten the people and culturally enrich them, to which Sandro replies that people can only be enlightened by a spiritual pastor. Keti and Abel and shown looking at a crucifix and Keti is explaining Jesus to Abel and how he is alive in heaven- Abel asks about his diseased mother and whether Jesus could revive her. Nino overhears and tells young Abel that his mother is alive in heaven. Varlam then performs William Shakespeare's Sonnet 66, stating ""a regime is a regime"" before exiting Sandro's apartment through the window with his men and his son. Moments later Varlam returns and explains that Abel took the crucifix believing it could revive his mom- he gives it to Nino saying ""take care of it, this is a very valuable thing.""
Nino has a dream where she and Sandro are being chased through the town by Varlam and his men and then out into a field where they attempt to hide by burying themselves in dirt before being discovered by Varlam who then sings the same song he had performed in their apartment earlier that evening. She wakes and tells Sandro that they must leave town, and Sandro reassures her that there is nothing they could be arrested for. Seconds later the doorbell rings and two of Varlam's soldiers tell Sandro he must come with them while they begin taking Sandro's art from his walls. Varlam then argues with Sandro's friend Mikhail Korisheli (who is also the local Party Secretary) after Mikhail dismisses a letter detailing Sandro's arrest as ridiculous. Varlam informs Mikhail that he and Sandro are related and says he is the enemy now- in response, Mikhail slaps Varlam.
Nino and Keti go with a slip of paper to a line presumably meant to tell them information on Sandro's wellbeing. A woman and her daughter hand over their paper and give their name and are told ""the parcel was received"" and the woman is relieved to the point of tears before walking away satisfied. The next woman is told whoever she is looking for has been exiled and she begins to argue and cries ""just tell us he's dead!"" Nino and Keti hand over their paper and are told Sandro has been exiled (so he has most likely been killed.)
We unsurprisingly learn that Mikhail has been arrested and Nino is left in a room alone with pictures of Varlam on sticks from his parade. She throws one on the ground and jabs it with a stick before noticing Varlam is standing in the room with her. She immediately stops and begins to praise him before falling to her knees and begging for him to help her; he responds by walking away. Soon after we see Keti and Nino searching a lumber yard for Sandro's body. Next we see Sandro being questioned in a garden by a piano-playing tuxedo-ed man and accompanied by a blindfolded woman holding the scales of justice. They bring out Mikhail who agrees he was a member of an organization attempting to dig a tunnel from Bombay to London and that Sandro was also a member. The tuxedo man leaves them to talk in private, leading the blindfolded woman with him. Mikhail has a sort of psychotic episode and collapses while Sandro sadly looks on. Varlam is shown giving an erratic, fear-inspiring speech to the town and then we see Nino being comforted by Yelena that Sandro would be released soon. Sandro is then shown being executed and the church is blown up right after.
Doksopulo alerts Varlam that he has arrested a truckload of people all with the same last name for him, happily saying he'd brought him ""a truck full of enemies."" At first Varlam snaps to release all of them and apologize and demands for Doksopulo's resignation, before changing his mind and arresting them all after all, allowing Doksopulo to keep his job.
Varlam's assistant visits Nino and Keti and gives them train tickets, telling her Varlam's men would be coming for them tonight. Moment's after Varlam's assistant leaves, his mom appear and take Nino and Keti.
It finally returns to the courtroom where Keti demands Varlam not be buried, for ""to bury him is to bury what he did.""
Varlam's grandson, Tornike, has a dream (?) that he's in a concrete enclosure with Varlam where he's threatening to kill the sun, before dying. Abel finds Tornike alone, still seated in the courtroom. He obviously, unlike the rest of his family, believed Keti's story. Him and his father argue over the kind of man Varlam was and Tornike tells Abel he hates him before exiting the room. Tornike is then shown laying in bed that night, while a doctor tells his parents he is in shock. He imagines Varlam laying in a casket as if it were a bed while a woman dances above him.
In court they argue over the sanity of Keti and Abel looks pensive. That night he goes into his basement where a crucifix is placed on the wall and asks for a confession from a priest that is pictured eating a raw fish while Abel confesses to him. Abel says he is worried about his faith- the priest responds that Abel is not concerned about good and evil and that it is his fear that is killing him. He admits to being afraid of himself and the kind of person he is. The priest then tells him he's a coward and that if it were up to him he would send Abel straight to hell. Abel get's angry and asks who he is and it's revealed that the priest was Varlam who says ""so you came to confess to the devil?"" and laughs. Abel is viably shaken at court, holding the skeleton of the fish Varlam had been eating. Keti says during court that Varlam continues to live as long as people continue to defend him. Tornike comes to visit her in her cell and asks for her forgiveness. She tells him they're putting her in an insane asylum and he confronts his father about it- they argue and his father slaps him. Tornike proceeds to kill himself in his room. Abel then throws his father's body off of a cliff.
It then returns to the kitchen scene from the beginning, and a woman on the street stops and asks Keti through her window is the road leads to a church. Keti replies ""No, this is Varlam Street and it doesn't lead to a church,"" to which the woman replies ""Then what do you need it for? Why have a road that doesn't lead to a church?"" before walking away."

Razorback,1984,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087981/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"As a vicious wild boar terrorizes the Australian outback, the husband of one of the victims is joined by a hunter and a farmer in a search for the beast. A vicious wild boar terrorizes the Australian outback. The first victim is a small child who is killed. The child's granddad is brought to trial for killing the child but acquitted. The next victim is an American TV-journalist. Her husband Carl gets there and starts to search for the truth. The local inhabitants won't really help him, but he is joined by a hunter and a female farmer to find the beast.—Mattias Thuresson New Yorker Carl Winters heads to Gamulla in the Australian Outback upon news that his wife Beth Winters has gone missing. Beth was there on behalf of the World Animal League, an activist group, doing a story on the slaughter of kangaroos and wallabies to near extinction, they being processed into cheap pet food. Her presence did not sit well with many locals in the business. While two meat processing workers, brothers Benny and Dicko Baker, were partly responsible for what eventually befell Beth, Carl has his focus divided upon arrival in meeting Jake Cullen and and subsequently Sarah Cameron, and eventually facing first hand with what they deal. Sarah has a grant to tag and thus follow the local wild boar population, while Jake, two years ago, was acquitted in the disappearance of his grandson due to insufficient evidence. Jake's story, incredulous to many, is that his grandson was carried off and assumed killed by a giant murderous razorback, a wild boar, giant in being the size of a rhinoceros. Since, Jake has made it his sole mission to find and kill that razorback. While rumors abound that Beth died in an accidental fall down a mine shaft, Jake believes that the razorback may have killed her as well. Carl's attention remains divided in believing the Dicko brothers were also responsible in some way for what happened to Beth, he after the brothers while assisting Jake and Sarah in what may be a kill or be killed situation with the razorback.—Huggo Jake Cullen (Bill Kerr) is babysitting his grandson at his house in the rural Australian outback when a massive and unseen razorback boar attacks him, smashing through his house like a high-speed freight train and dragging away his grandson to devour alive. Jake is accused of murdering the child and while his account of the events are met with high skepticism, he is acquitted due to lack of evidence. The event destroys his credibility and reputation however and he vows revenge on the boar.Two years later, wildlife reporter Beth Winters (Judy Morris) journeys to the outback to document the hunting of Australian wildlife to be processed into pet food at a derelict factory. While driving at night, she is driven off the road by two local thugs, Benny and Dicko Baker (Chris Haywood and David Argue respectively), who attempt to rape her only to be chased off by the same boar that killed Jake's grandson. Beth attempts to take shelter in her car, but the hog rips off the door, lacerating her groin with its tusk before dragging her out to be eaten. With no witnesses, her disappearance is subsequently ruled an accident resulting from falling down an abandoned mine shaft after leaving her wrecked car.A few months later, Beth's husband Carl (Gregory Harrison) arrives in in Australia to search for her and encounters Jake, whom Beth interviewed during her initial report. Jake refers him to the local cannery where he meets Benny and Dicko whom he convinces to take him along on their next kangaroo hunt, only to be abandoned by them when he spoils a potential kill. Carl is then attacked by a herd of wild hogs, spurned on by the giant boar, who chase him through the night and force him take shelter atop an abandoned windmill. The next morning, the hogs succeed in knocking over the windmill, but Carl is saved by landing in a pond at the windmill's base that is too deep for the hogs to cross over.Once the hogs leave, Carl attempts to make his way back to civilization, all the while suffering from dehydration inspired hallucinations before finally reaching the house of Sarah Cameron (Arkie Whiteley), a friend of Jake who has been tracking and studying the local hog population and the only one who believes his story of the giant razorback. While recovering at Sarah's house, Carl forms a friendship with her and learns that something has been causing the wild hogs excess stress, leading them into unusual behavior such as increased aggression and cannibalizing their own young.Meanwhile, after learning that Carl had seen the razorback, Jake sets out for the pumping station and manages to shoot it with one of Sarah's tracking darts. He also finds Beth's wedding ring in the boar's scat which he returns to a grieving Carl, who resigns himself to returning home.After overhearing a radio conversation suggesting that Jake knows what really happened to Beth Winters, Benny and Dicko, fearful that Jake is attempting to implicate them in her death, attack him at his camp, breaking his legs and leaving him to be killed by the razorback. His remains are later found by Sarah and Carl, along with marks in the dirt made by Dicko's cleaver. Realizing that the brothers were responsible for both his wife and Jake's death, Carl attacks Benny at his and Dicko's hideaway, interrogating Benny by lowering him into a mine shaft before leaving him to plummet to his death.As Sarah rounds up a posse to hunt down the razorback using the tracer Jake shot into it, Carl corners Dicko at the cannery when the razorback suddenly appears and mauls Dicko before Carl can shoot him. The razorback then chases Carl into the factory when Sarah suddenly arrives and is seemingly killed by the boar, who continues to pursue Carl even after being impaled through its throat with a broken pipe. In its maddened rampage, the razorback ends up damaging the cannery's generator which sends the machines running out of control. Carl lures the boar up onto a conveyor belt that throws it onto a giant fan, chopping it to pieces. After shutting down the machinery, Carl finds and rescues Sarah, who had merely been knocked unconscious, and the two embrace."

With the exception of Jocko, the older members of his gang, and nightclub performer Lil Sheridan who would become Mrs. Dangerously, no one knew of Johnny's double life, those not in the know including Ma, and Johnny's earnest, straight-laced, law-abiding younger brother, Tommy Kelly, they who believed Johnny was solely a hard-working and successful nightclub owner.

A pet shop owner catches a young boy shoplifting a puppy. To discourage the kid from a life of crime, the owner tells a story....The year is 1910. Young Johnny Kelly (Byron Thames) is a poor but honest newsboy in New York City. Johnny beats up Danny Vermin (Georg Olden) in self defense and discovers his mom needs an operation they cannot afford. Since the execution of Johnny's father, Killer Kelly, his widow, Ma Kelly (Maureen Stapleton), has supported Johnny and his younger brother, Tommy, who is fascinated by the law.Johnny's fight with Vermin attracted the notice of local crime boss Jocko Dundee (Peter Boyle), and Johnny, seeing no honest way to earn the money for his mom's operation, sees no choice than to do a job for Dundee, even though it probably means breaking the law, and in doing so, ""breaking his mother's heart"". He helps Dundee rob the nightclub belonging to Dundee's rival, Roman Moronie (Richard Dimitri). When asked his name, Johnny coins the name, ""Johnny Dangerously"", but Moronie, a malapropist of swearwords, never ""forgets a fargin face.""Several years pass by. With his mom's continuing medical problems, the adult Johnny (Michael Keaton) goes to work for the Dundee gang full time. He becomes a suave young man, with plenty of folding cash. The whole neighborhood, including the local Pope (Dom DeLuise) knows that Kelly is really Johnny Dangerously, but Johnny's secret identity is carefully concealed from his brother and mother. They think he is a law-abiding nightclub owner. Similarly, the gang knows nothing of Johnny's mother and brother. Tommy (Griffin Dunne as an adult) is now in law school, with a girlfriend, and somewhat of a prighe wants to drop out of law school so he can get a job, marry his girlfriend, and ""get laid.""

Danny has lived up to his potential and become a total scumbag, with a taste for using opera audiences as shooting galleries with his .88 Magnum pistol. Moronie, subtle as always, sends a robot with a machine gun to try to knock off the gang. He is not successful, and Johnny retaliates by knocking down Moronie's club (which was in need of expansion anyway) with a bomb dropped from a biplane.The two gangs go to war. In the meantime, Johnny falls for a young showgirl new to the big city, Lil Sheridan (Marilu Henner), who, when she meets Johnny for the first time, asks him, ""Do you know your last name is an adverb?"". They go for a long walk together, ending in sexual fireworks.The gang war continues. Moronie sends a plumber to plant explosives in Dundee's toilet. Dundee has a narrow escape, and he retires in Johnny's favor.

Tommy tries the case against him. Johnny is found guilty, sentenced to the electric chair and sent to death row.

Another Country,1984,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086904/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Based on the life of the youngGuy Burgess, who would become better known as one of the Cambridge Spies. Based on the award winning play byJulian Mitchell, the film explores the effect of Public School life in the 1930's onGuy Burgessas his homosexuality and unwillingness to ""play the game"" turns him eastwards towards communist Russia.—Craig Wood <cew@jiffi.demon.co.uk> Moscow. Elderly BritGuy Burgessis being interviewed by American journalist Julia Schofield about how his life ended up on the path it did, unusual considering his proper British upbringing. In relaying his story, he focuses on the transition into his senior year at a prestigious boys school in Britain in the 1930s. He was friends with Tommy Judd, largely because of them both lying somewhat outside the lives of the other students. Judd was an intellectual Marxist, who would not participate in what he considered the oppression of school traditions which were perpetuated by fathers - former students - sending their sons to their alma mater. Guy, who did aspire to the top rung of the student hierarchy by becoming a ""God"" - one of the top prefects - in his senior year as a stepping stone to becoming a diplomat as a career, was open about his homosexuality to his classmates. That year, he believed he fell in love for the first time in his life with fellow student James Harcourt, those feelings reciprocated. Both Guy and Tommy were friendly enough with their fellow house upperclassmen, who respected Tommy for having principles to which he did not stray, and turned a blind eye to Guy's sexual activities if only to maintain overall peace. An event at the school that year involving another student would place greater scrutiny on the activities and behaviors of the entire student body. Tommy would be asked to do something that both appealed to his Marxist ideals of working for the greater good, but that also went against his principles against the traditions of the school. A struggle for power, with all students, including Guy and Tommy, largely against a tyrannical student named Fowler, who likened himself to a military officer, would have a profound affect on Guy and his life beliefs.—Huggo"

Meanwhile, Karla Davis (Caren Larkey), an actress scheduled to work with Denise on an upcoming coffee commercial, had a premonition about the accident and Denise's fate, but was unable to warn her in time.At the hospital, Denise is under the care of Dr. Brian Richardson (Kurt Johnson), who releases her after eight days. Although she has almost no physical injuries, the doctor advises Denise about the guilt feelings she may experience as a result of a psychological condition known as ""survivor's syndrome."" Denise leaves through a back entrance of the hospital to avoid reporters who have coined her the ""Miracle Girl."" While waiting for her friend and next-door neighbor, Kristy Cutler (Robin Davidson), to pick her up, Denise sees a wounded girl standing alone on the hospital loading dock. The young girl stares at her and does not speak. Suddenly, Denise is almost hit by a driver-less truck that backs towards her. Kristy arrives and reassures her friend that faulty brakes probably caused the truck to move.On the way home, Denise tells Kristy about her attraction to the handsome Dr. Brian Richardson. When the doctor telephones to check on her, Denise senses that he may be interested in her as well, and she invites him to watch the filming of the coffee commercial next week. That same night, Denise receives a mysterious phone call from Karla Davis, who warns her to keep her doors locked, then hangs up.On the day of the commercial shoot, Karla Davis struggles with her lines and confirms everyone's impression that she is a washed-up, alcoholic actress. Karla's agent, Blake, apologizes for his client's behavior and says she must have been intoxicated when she telephoned Denise. Meanwhile, Denise is pleased that Brian has accepted her invitation and arrived at the studio. After work, they walk through the park and kiss. The two spend the night together, but Denise is distracted by the image of a peculiar old man, who was earlier staring at her in the park. When Brian mentions that the body of a young girl temporarily disappeared from the morgue, Denise wonders whether it is the same girl she saw at the hospital loading dock.Another day later, while driving to work, Denise swerves to avoid a man standing in the middle of the road and nearly runs her car off the road. Similar to the young girl at the hospital and the old man in the park, the zombie-like man in the road stares and says nothing. Denise drives away.At the studio, Karla continues to fumble her lines and leaves the set. When Denise talks to the actress, Karla reveals that she is troubled by psychic powers, but is not crazy, as most people believe. She walks away and Denise attempts to follow the actress, but winds up alone in a underground parking garage where she comes face to face with another zombie-like man, who pursues her. Denise narrowly escapes.That afternoon at a restaurant, Denise tells Brian she feels as if she will be ""caught"" soon. Brian warns that the majority of sole survivors die within two years of living through a catastrophe because they are often careless and wander into life-threatening situations.Later that evening, Denise is in need of company and goes across the street to Kristy's house, interrupting a game of strip poker with her and her friends. Kristy asks her friends to leave and listens as Denise discusses her recent problems with the coffee commercial. When Denise falls asleep on the couch, Kristy walks to Denise's empty house with plans to invite her friends there. She enters the home and is attacked by a stranger who drowns her in the swimming pool. After Denise awakens, she looks across the street and sees the same man who was in the middle of the highway standing at her front door. She telephones the police, but they find nothing suspicious, only a note from Kristy that she is away with friends.At the station, Lieutenant Patterson (Daniel Cartmell) tells Brian that the man Denise identified as the person at the front door was a highway inspector, who died of a heart attack in his car a couple days before. Therefore, he could not have been at Denise's house. Patterson also indicates to the doctor that Denise might be imagining these occurrences, since she was drinking alcohol and taking anti-depressants that evening. When Brian questions her state of mind, Denise insists she was not inebriated and is positive the highway inspector was the same person at her front door and the one standing in the road. While Brian leaves to speak with his contact at the morgue, Denise stays at his apartment and requests that her answering service forward calls there. Karla telephones to apologize for her behavior during the commercial and asks for her job back, but Denise is unable to help. When the actress hangs up, she realizes she finally has a ""role"" to play and contemplates a razor blade.After speaking with his friend, Artie (William Snare), at the morgue, Brian tries to comprehend why the highway inspector and other recent corpses appear to have been standing or walking after they died as indicated by blood flow to their legs. When he telephones Denise, Brian receives a message that she has taken a cab home to pick up clothes and her car. Rushing there, he passes a cab on the side of the road and finds the dead body of the driver nearby, having been killed by the zombie Kristy.The doctor arrives at the house and calls out for Denise. She appears downstairs and witnesses Brian being stabbed by Kristy's reanimated corpse. Denise drives away, escaping the clutches of another reanimated corpse (the taxi driver). While driving through downtown Santa Ana, Denise runs out of gas and she is forced to walk... alone on the city street. When a group of street gang members approach her, Denise frightens them way with a pistol she took from Brian just before he was killed. Denise boards a city bus and rides alone, noticing another zombie man on the street.Panic-stricken, Denise goes to Karla's apartment, and says the actress is the one person who understands her predicament. As Denise reaches for the telephone to call police, Karla shoots her dead. The actress's reanimated corpse returns to the bathtub where she earlier committed suicide.The final scene has Artie at the morgue with the bodies of Denise, Brian, Carla, Kristy and the taxi driver. Artie continues to be puzzled at how the blood in the bodies of the last three corpses drained into their legs. After talking to the skeptic Lt. Patterson over the phone over the irregularity, Artie begins to finally suspect something strange is going on. In the final shot, as Artie begins to type out a report of his find, the bodies of Kristy and the others slowly rise up from their slabs behind him... to presumably kill him too in order to keep the supernatural events of the walking dead suppressed.The End"

She tells him that she killed all those dancers out of jealousy of their rising careers, while planning to frame him for the killings as her final act of revenge against him. She pulls on George's pin-holding hand and impales herself on it, and falls to the floor dead. Borges and Davis arrive on the scene where they know that George is not the killer. When they saw the photo slide Molly took of the killer's jacket, they noticed that the buttons on the killer's jacket were on the left side, which implemented to be a woman's jacket.

The Annunciation,1984,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0123381/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"When Adam and Eve, having succumbed to Lucifer's temptation, are cast out of the Garden of Eden, Adam holds Lucifer to his promise, reminding him that ""You said I would know everything!"" So Lucifer grants Adam a dream of the world to come. And what a bizarre dream: Adam becomes Miltiades in Athens; a knight called Tancred in Byzantium; Kepler in Prague; Danton in revolutionary Paris; and a nameless suitor in Victorian London. Guided by a deceptively sweet but ultimately contemptuous Lucifer, Adam confronts an endless procession of the horror of the human story - rapists and concubines, betrayal and savagery, mindless cruelty and fanaticism. Angyali üdvözlet, aka ""The Annunciation"", is a surreal account of the history of humanity as portrayed entirely by children between the ages of 8 and 12. The film begins with the biblical story as Adam (Péter Bocsor) and Eve (Júlia Mérö), are deceived by Lucifer (Eszter Gyalog) -- three very photogenic leads -- into tasting the ""Forbidden Fruit"". They are thus chased out of the Garden of Eden by the Angel of Death and, in a vision, sent on an existential journey through western European history.Always followed closely and influenced by the deceptively sweet, but contemptuous Lucifer, we follow Adam through The Plague, wars, Byzantium's wretched cripples, the French Revolution, the squalor of Dickensian London, and a final return to the scene of the crucifixion. Of course the picture makes a case for its premise -- that of the consequences of Original Sin -- yet does so in a very unique way. In the closing scene, Lucifer says, ""Why did I strive to achieve greatness in man, who is...in knowlege a pygmy, in blindness a giant?"" This reflects the somewhat nihilistic view of a nation still under the boot of Soviet communism.This rare movie may be one of the best (and only child-starred) art films ever."

Just then, Dr. Tate's co-worker, Vic, whom has been sick and coughing, begins to turn into a grey-skinned, black-eyed, zombie-like creature who attacks Dr. Tate.The next morning, Josh and Holly travel to the New Era construction site which is fenced off and they discover the secret of the sickness in the town; it is revealed that toxic chemical waste from an illegal dump has turned most of the townspeople into grey-skinned, black-eyed zombies who come out at night and feast on the dwindling population of the town. Josh and Holly barely escape from the facility and dodge bullets from the security guards and workers.At this point, the movie evolves into a 'Night of the Living Dead'-esq thriller as Josh Holly, and Sheriff Stewart must find a way to not only escape from the town, but also find a way to kill all the mutant zombies before they become victims themselves. Josh first goes to the police station to report his find, only to find Stewart getting drunk after being relieved from duty. Holly goes to her house to check on her sick uncle only to get attacked by him as he rises up a blood-drinking zombie too with his hands as leech-like clamps to suck a victim's blood. Holly is saved by the arrival of Josh and Stewart, forcing the zombie Jack to flee.Finally aware what is going on and that the creatures are afraid of the light, Josh suggests getting the Georgia State Police into town to help while he tries to find his missing brother. The three of them split up hoping to get out of town before nightfall.Josh goes to the boarding house where he ventures to the basement and finds the dead bodies of his brother Mike as well as the EPA guy and a few others where it is revealed that the landlady is keeping the zombie mutant of her daughter locked up in the basement and feeding her unsuspecting victims. Josh manages to get out of the cellar and the landlady falls victim to her own zombie daughter.Meanwhile, Holly and Sheriff Stewart go to the medical clinic to look for Dr. Tate and to take the dead body of the girl as evidence for the state police only to find Dr. Tate dead and several mutant zombies attacking them. Holly is forced to run, while the sheriff is trapped between two groups and is forced to lock himself inside a medicine closet.As night comes, Holly finds Billy wondering the streets and chases him inside the school where Billy is frightened claiming that his parents have come back and are trying to kill him. A group of zombie school children attack, forcing Holly and Billy to flee inside the boy's room where Billy is killed by the horde of zombie children. Josh arrives and saves Holly, forcing them to flee.The two survivors drive in Holly's car to the medical clinic to try to rescue Sheriff Stewart. While Holly waits inside the car, Josh goes inside the medical building only to find the sheriff gone and several dead zombies lying around. Just then a large group of zombies emerge from the mist outside and attack Holly in her car, using their toxic powers of their hands to literally 'melt' the car windows to get at her. Unable to drive away since Josh had taken the car keys, Holly honks the horn, forcing Josh to run outside where he fights several zombies and manages to get back in the car to drive away. But on their way out of town, a zombie left on the roof of the car forces their car to crash along the town's main street.Forced to flee on foot, Josh and Holly hide inside the closed garage. Josh and Holly begin to make Molotov cocktails to use when Albert arrives with a shotgun. Deranged to the last, Albert instead tries to use Holly and Josh as 'bait' for the zombies resulting in a struggle where Albert's shotgun is discharged, and giving away their hiding place. The horde of zombies break into the garage where they grab Albert and drag him outside where they apparently kill him as well. Josh opens fire on the zombies with Albert's shotgun until he runs out of ammo. He then lights and throws the Molotov cocktails, setting a few zombies on fire. But more and more of them keep coming, leading to them breaking down the garage door and burst through the windows forcing Josh and Holly behind the counter. Just when it looks like they are both done for, several state police cars arrive and the policemen blast away at the zombies, killing all of them. Josh and Holly venture outside and see that Sheriff Stewart had indeed escaped and brought the state police with him."

Combat Shock,1984,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090866/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A dangerously disturbed Vietnam veteran struggles with life 15 years after his return home, and slowly falls into insanity from his gritty urban lifestyle. Frankie is a war vet whose life sucks. He has no money, a nagging wife, junkie friends, and a deformed baby. This is the story of one day in his pathetic post-war life.—Josh Pasnak <chainsaw@intouch.bc.ca> The film begins with stock footage scenes of warfare in Vietnam. A soldier named Frankie (Ricky Giovinazzo) is seen running alone through the jungle as his voice narrates. He explains that he ""goes back there every night"" right before he wakes up in bed with his wife in their squalid NYC apartment. The distorted cries of his baby are heard, and his very pregnant wife Cathy (Veronica Stork) wakes up to tend to their six-month-old son. They argue over Frankie's unemployment and their son's health. The baby is a mutant. Frankie assumes it was a result of chemical weapons, such as Agent Ornage, used during the war.Frankie then goes out onto the urban jungle of the streets. He passes by a junkie friend of his named Mike (Michael Tierno) whom Frankie chats up with for a while before walking away. Mike buys some drugs from the local kingpin, Paco (Mitch Maglio). The junkie desperately searches for a needle to shoot up with.Frankie waits in line outside the unemployment office. But after a while, Frankie's social worker (Ray Pinero) tells him that there is no work for him at the current time. Typical of the movie, unexplained arbitrary things happen, such as the social worker asking another if he's seen his Veg-O-Matic. Frankie's social worker spaces out during their meeting and says, ""Life is hot, and because life is hot, I must take off my jacket."" He then resumes the meeting, imploring Frankie to go back to school because he has no marketable skills. Frankie claims that he has no money or funds for college and is desperate for work, having been unemployed for four months.Back on the streets, Frankie kills time entertaining a child prostitute. But when he tells the prostitute that he has no money, she tells him to go away. After Frankie leaves, the child prostitute's pimp (Arthur Saunders) beats up the teenage girl for not making enough money.Meanwhile, the junkie Mike resorts to dumping the drugs directly onto a wound he opens in his arm with a rusted coat hanger wire and passes out... maybe dead. A random woman comes upon him and steals his gun and ammunition, putting them in her purse.Frankie calls his father (Leo Lunney) from a local payphone to ask for money. His father thinks the call is a prank, because he believes his son died in Saigon 15 years ago. Frankie explains that he was reported killed in action back in 1970, but he made it out alive and spent three years in a U.S. Army hospital recuperating. Frankie tells his father that his wife is pregnant again and they are being evicted within a few days from their Staten Island apartment, but his father says that he is also broke and about to die any day from a terminal heart condition.Seemingly broken, Frankie comes across the same woman who stole the junkie's gun and steals her purse; an out of character criminal act for him. She screams for help. Paco and his two thugs chase Frankie. When they overcome him, they mercilessly beat him up. The gun falls out of the bag during the pummeling. When Paco goes through the bag to steal the woman's cash, he finds the bullets and realizes there must have been a gun in it. He turns around to see Frankie standing with the revolver. Frankie shoots and kills all three men in a daze.With Frankie beaten to a pulp, his voice-over explains that his father was right: he had died in Saigon. He explains in another flashback to Vietnam that his company had come upon a village where everyone had killed themselves to avoid being raped and murdered by the US soldiers. Frankie went AWOL and spent days wondering aimlessly in the jungle. He realizes that he must similarly 'save' his family, and he returns home.That evening, Frankie returns home where Cathy is horrified by his appearance and briefly tends to his wounds. He is catatonic and hallucinates in front of the TV. Eventually, he reloads the gun and prepares to kill himself, but another hallucination reminds him of his purpose for returning home. Frankie walks into the bedroom, tells his pregnant wife that he loves her, and then shoots her in the stomach. As she lies on the ground, he shoots her three more times, yelling at her to die. He shoots the deformed baby and then picks it up from the crib. He cradles it and walks into the kitchen with it. Frankie lays the baby in the oven, and turns it all the way to the cleaning setting. He then pours himself a glass of spoiled milk and drinks it before committing suicide by shooting himself in the head.The final shot shows a Staten Island subway train passing by Frankie's apartment building and speeds off into the night."

A murderer is running loose through the streets of London, hunting down men dressed as Santa and killing them all in different, and extremely violent, fashions. Inspector Harris has decided to take on the unenviable task of tracking down the psychopath, but he's going to have his work cut out for him. Only the suspicious reporter, Giles, seems to offer the Inspector any promising leads.—Jean-Marc Rocher <rocher@fiberbit.net> A woman greets a man dressed as Santa Claus, and they head to a nearby car to make out with each other.

A photographer named Gerry sees the two, and he and Cliff go for a drink. At a nearby pub, Gerry asks Cliff to the studio and tells him there might be something for him, especially if he brings Kate. Cliff then tells Kate that Gerry invited them for tea. The couple walks to the studio and they walk in while Gerry is taking pictures of a model named Sharon who is posing. Cliff tries to persuade Kate to do some shots for Gerry, by saying ""it's a quick 50 quid"". But when Gerry brings out a Santa outfit, Kate storms out. Gerry convinces the irate Cliff to stay.Later that evening, Cliff is outside with Sharon (mostly nude under her Santa costume), and he tries to go back in when he sees policeman approaching, but the door is locked.

The cops find a frightened Sharon and lead her away. At the police station, Harris and Powell talk to Sharon to ask her to give them a description of the killer, but she tells them that it was dark and she could only see the killer's eyes, ""which seemed to smile"".At a local porno house peep show, a Santa Claus arrives and sits to watch a nude woman. After the woman dances a bit, the Santa is attacked in the booth by the unseen killer and stabbed in the back.Cliff and Kate are seen arguing with each other.

Powell trails Harris to a local shopping mall, but loses him outside in the crowd.That evening, another drunken Santa is seen leaving a pub and then hanging around outside a local museum. He enters the museum through a back door when the unseen killer approaches. In attempting to flee, the killer easily catches up to the doped-up Santa and stabs him twice in his stomach before fleeing.The next day, Harris goes to see Powell and talks about the ""decoys"" being sent out. Two undercover police officers are seen dressed as Santa at a local carnival. The unseen killer approaches and kicks one of the undercover Santas in the crotch with a boot-knife and punches him with a studded glove. The killer then shoves a broken bottle into the eye of the other Santa cop.Powell talks to the woman from the peep show if she saw the killer, and she says she can only remember a dark figure with the ""smiling eyes"". Meanwhile, Kate calls Harris' private phone number, and his housekeeper tells her that it is the day the inspector visits Parkland's.The woman from the peep show return to her job, and the unseen killer arrives and punches through the glass to get at her. She is chased into the streets, where she is grabbed, dragged into a room, and thrown unto a bed. She tells the killer that she did not tell the cops anything and has not seen his face. But when she turns to look, the killer tells her that it is already too late. The woman is restrained with a chain and left alone.At the station, Powell released Cliff from custody ""once and for all"" because he thinks he knows the ""right man"" who is doing all the killing.Meanwhile, another inebriated Santa on the street is approached by the killer who chases the drunk man into an auditorium where there is concert taking place and ""Miss Caroline Munro"" is performing with her band. The Santa hides backstage but is found and gets a blade to his face. The killer throws the dead Santa onto an elevator lift and brings the dead body upon the stage before the horrified Miss Munro and her band.At Kate's place, she tells Powell that Harris was at Parkland's ""lunatic asylum"". She says that she cannot find a record of his name anywhere and that Harris irrationally implies that Cliff is the Santa Killer, despite the fact that Cliff was beside her when her father was attacked that night. Powell takes Kate's comments lightly. Kate goes to see Doctor Bridle at Parkland Mental Hospital.That evening, another ""jolly ol' St. Nick"" is working at a local department store before he goes to relieve himself. The Santa goes to the men's room where the unseen killer follows him in and uses a straight razor to slice off a particular body part, causing the Santa to bleed to death all over the urinal and men's room floor.Kate goes to see Harris who has now been suspended from the police force. She says that Cliff has been acting differently. Since it is Christmas Eve, the two of them decide to go out to dinner together. During the dinner, Kate asks Harris at what his first name is. Cliff arrives and is taken out of the restaurant by the host because his is not dressed properly. Cliff and Kate see each other.Back at Kate's apartment, Giles is there, and he pushes her against the wall before she can get to the phone. Kate tells him that she has figured out that Giles is Harris' brother, and that Harris has changed his name from Harrison when Giles was put in the Parkland institution. Giles says that he threatened his brother by saying that he would go to the newspapers if he did not visit him. Kate accuses Giles of being the Santa Killer by accusing him of killing her father. Giles says that Kate's father, like all of his other victims, reminded him to Christmastime. Powell calls Kate and she runs for the phone, but Giles pulls her back with tinsel from the nearby Christmas tree and stabs her in the stomach.Powell and another police officer arrive at the apartment to find Kate dead. Powell is told that Harris has been in his apartment all night. Outside, Powell spots Giles running from the scene and chases him to a warehouse filled with parked cars. Giles hooks cables to a car and murders Powell by electrocuting him to the wired car.Giles then returns to the flat with some food for the captive woman, Shelley Graham, from the peep show. She talks about Christmas and with her hands now free to eat, she hits Giles on the head with a piece of wood. Giles declares her to be the ""supreme sacrifice"" for the evil of Christmas and Shelley runs out the door. She is chased upstairs and Giles swings the chain around, terrorizing her. Shelley grabs the chain and pulls him over the stair railing, letting him fall. At the bottom of the stairs, Shelley approaches the motionless Giles, but he gets right back up and attacks her again....Meanwhile, Harris stirs in his sleep. A flashback to many years ago shows a young Giles at Christmastime walking in on his father (who is dressed as Santa) with another woman. Giles' mother also walks in and sees the couple. The father angrily hits his wife and she falls down a flight of stairs while the young Giles and young Harris watch.Harris wakes up, and sees that it is morning; Christmas. Harris takes the package from his desk and unwraps it. There is a note with the package saying ""from your Loving Brother"". Harris opens a box to see a tiny music box with music and a dancing Santa. He sits it on his desk and rests in a nearby chair, listening to the soft Christmas music the box plays. When the song ends, the box suddenly explodes, killing Harris."
Voyage to Cythera,1984,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088241/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"An old communist returns to Greece after 32 years in the Soviet Union. However, things aren't the way he had hoped for. A film-maker, Alexandros (Brogi), auditions a succession of old men who speak the line, 'It's me, it's me.' Tiring of the task, he goes to a café and sees his perfect actor, a lavender-seller. Alexandros follows the man to Piraeus where, it transpires, the film-maker is to meet his father Spyros, a resistance fighter (Katrakis) returning to Greece after 32 years in the Soviet Union. In ""Voyage to Cythera,"" we follow Spyros' long and erratic wanderings in an attempt to reach the Greek island of Cythera. The man spent so many years away from all his family and friends, and is now back in his native country. Now older, filled with frustration, Spyros prefers not to talk about his past.—Anonymous Having spent 32 long years in exile in USSR, weary Spiros, a white-haired former fighter of the Democratic Army of Greece, returns to his hometown. Overcome with melancholy and doubt, taciturn Spiros visits his barren village, only to face an entirely different reality from the one he had dreamed of when he was younger. And, unable to fit in, Spiros chooses to live with his memories. After all, he is a stranger in his own land, an alienated troublemaker without identity.—Nick Riganas As the film opens, a woman from a window calls, ""Alexander!"" at a young boy who runs away through the Athens streets. His course ends near a German sentinel standing under an arch, his back turned toward the boy. The boy tiptoes near the soldier and, as a tease, hits him in the back. The soldier pursues the boy back along the path from which he arrived. The boy eludes the German soldier, and eventually finds his way home.Cut to a grown-up Alexander (Julio Brogi, whose voice is dubbed by Angelopoulos himself), in a modern apartment, waking from what was obviously a dream from his childhood.The next scene takes place in a film studio, where a roomful of old men are auditioning for a movie role. One by one, each steps toward a table and says the common Greek assertion of identity, ""Ego eimai"" (""It's me""). Following a break in the casting call, all the men are standing outside the studio when Alexander appears, skipping and shuffling, obviously preoccupied and lost in his thoughts. He enters a kafeneon and meets his mistress, who is sitting alone at a table. She complains that they don't seem to see each other anymore outside of the studio. Alexander does not answer as an old man (Manos Katrakis) approaches selling lavender from a wicker basket. Alexander ignores the old man's offer, but he is fascinated and follows him, trailing him through the streets to the harbor. The old man disappears as we see a large ship, the ""Ukraina,"" approaching the pier.This is the precise transitional point when the movie about film director Alexander morphs into a film-within-a-film, with Alexander becoming the protagonist in his own film, together with his sister, Voula (Mary Chronopoulou). They are waiting for their father, Spyros, who is returning home after a thirty-two year exile in the USSR.We first see an old man, Spyros (Manos Katrakis), reflected in a pool of water on the pier (the same old man who was selling lavender). We then see him standing at the foot of the ship's gangway, with a suitcase in one hand and a violin case in the other. He slowly approaches his two children, and says ""Ego eumai,"" just as the men did previously in the casting call. Alexander and Voula stand apart from their father, as if frozen. They introduce themselves. Eventually, Spyros says, ""Aren't we going to kiss each other?"" at which they all kiss and hug, but this ""effusion"" seems contrived and distant. Voula says, Mother is waiting at home.""The trio drives to a house in a modest section of town. Spyros' wife, Katerina (Dora Volanaki) is standing on the doorstep. She asks, ""Have you had anything to eat?"" Inside the apartment, Spyros is surrounded by members of his family who introduce themselves to him, following which he retreats to a room where his wife sits on a bed. The door closes behind him. A short time later, Katerina emerges in tears and locks herself in the kitchen, while Spyros picks up his belongings and leaves the house. Alexander runs after him, following him to a hotel. Alexander does not understand his father's actions, and he does his best to explain his mother's feelings, how she waited faithfully all these many years for his return, but Spyros is not moved.The next day, Alexander, Voula, Katerina and Spyros drive to Spyros' ancestral Macedonian mountain village. As they near the village, the car stops and we hear a strange whistling, half-tune, half-speech, that Spyros answers in the same manner. Katerina explains that he is conversing with his old comrade, Panayotis (Giorgos Nezos), using the old secret code of the communist guerillas. Spyros leaves the groups and walk up the hill, at the top of which he meets his aged dog, Argos. He then meets and embrace Panayotis, and they walk through the cemetery, where as Spyros passes their graves, addresses by their names each of his dead comrades.Suddenly, there is a commotion in the distance: like an army on the move, people riding and on foot approach. Panayotis explains that the whole village is coming to meet the developer of a future ski resort with the intent of selling him the entire mountain grounds. Panayotis then confesses to Spyros that ever since they were young lads, he has been in love with Katerina. Panayotis sings an old folk song about lost love and old age, ""Forty Red Apples,"" and Spyros joins in. He stands and dances a ""Pontiko,"" to the rhythm of Panayotis' hand clapping.Alexander arrives where the men are singing and dancing, announcing that they should go down to the village to open the ancestral house. At the door, Katerina hands Spyros a large house key. As they enter and go upstairs, everyone removes the newspapers that had covered the windows while the house was uninhabited.The next scene takes place on the mountain top the following day. The whole village has assembled to sign away the village grounds to the developer. All the villagers must sign, or the deal is off. Spyros walks past the assembled group and he tears down some boundary markers. He then retrieves a spade from a nearby wooden shack, and digs the ground vigorously, thus signaling that he is not selling his ancestral land. The deal is off, causing a great commotion as everybody leaves the area. Spyros remains alone on his mountain top.We are next in the old house, where the family is assembled around the dinner table. Katerina is slicing a loaf of bread, and she identifies each slices recipient, including a possible, ""stranger who may knock at our door."" Outside, someone calls to Katerina, asking why she won't sign over the deed to their land--""If you don't sign, the deal is off."" Katerina rises and sends the man away. Soon, another villager calls out for Spyros to get lost and let Katerina sign the deed. He shouts, ""Spyros, you're deadfinishedyou don't exist."" Spyros goes outside and confronts the villager who retreats, weeping.Spyros goes back inside, and apparently talks to himself about his exile, mentioning the three children he has ""over there,"" and we realize that Katerina is also in the room. She asks simply, ""What is she likethe other one?""Next day, everybody is returning to Athens, except Spyros. Spyros walks down the street and meets an old villager with whom he shares a cigarette. The men briefly reminisce about the Greek civil war and how they fought against each other, ""man against man, wolf against wolf.""Cut to the mountain top where Spyros climbs with a spade on his shoulder. Suddenly, he stares at a conflagration: the old shack is on fire.The police arrive in the deserted village, looking for Spyros. Alexander, Katerina, and Panayotis are also there. Eventually, they walk to Spyros' hiding place: the family's ancestral house. Panayotis establishes contact with Spyros through their whistling code: Spyros has barricaded himself in the house. Katerina walks to the door and says, ""Ego eimai."" Spyros opens the door and she leads him outside. The police chief (Athinodoros Prousalis) explains that Spyros is a ""displaced person,"" and therefore his resident permit can be withdrawn at any time, should he not behave.The next scenes take us out of the film-within-the-film, and we see modern-day Alexander following the end of a play, meeting his mistress on the stage. They make love on the floor of the empty theater. Alexander is next in his office, listening to messages left on his answering machine. One message details information about a boat's schedule to Cythera.This trip will probably be for the film Alexander wants to make about the island.Cut back to Spyros and Katerina walking on a snowy mountain top, and then being driven in the back of a pick-up truck. They finally sit in a waiting room of a train station of a small border town. A police car arrives to take them back to the Thessanoliki harbor, where they sit in another drab waiting room. Spyros begins a short and cryptic monolog, ""I hear you"" Outside, the authorities discuss what to do with this old partisan.As Alexander and Panayotis stand next to a food service truck drinking coffee, Voula arrives to inform them that an expulsion order has been issued. As they talk, a police car arrives to take Spyros and Katerina to a launch waiting for them at the dock. The launch cruises toward a Soviet ship which is leaving the harbor, and the police ask the ship captain to take Spyros back to the USSR. Because of a misunderstanding, the Russian captain refuses, so the launch returns to the harbor with its passengers.At the harbor, preparations for a longshoremens celebration are underway. Katerina feels ill, and is lying down, half-asleep, recalling her first meeting with Spyros as he was coming to Greece as a refugee from Ionia.It is raining. The police take Spyros again to the launch in the harbor, and they transfer him to a raft anchored in international waters. He must remain there until they get further instructions from their superiors about what to do with this ""displaced person."" They leave him standing in the rain on the raft, with only an umbrella for protection.Meanwhile, although the weather is miserable, the musicians arrive and the festivities begin. There are several scenes in the kafeneon, where we see revelers singing and dancing. Katerina is asked to come up to the covered music stand and make a speech. She slowly comes up to the microphone on the stage and says,"" I want to go with him."" The police oblige and take her to the anchored raft.The last scene opens with Spyros and Katerina in each other's arms, sitting on the wet floor of the raft. The rain has stopped but the sun cannot penetrate the thick mist. Spyros gets up and says: ""Daybreak,"" to which Katerina answers, ""I am ready."" Spyros unties the anchor and they slowly drift toward the open sea."

I guerrieri dell'anno 2072,1984,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0085627/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"In 2072 Rome, Italy, the ruthless CEO of a TV network plots to stage a modern series of gladiator games for ratings while one 'contenstant' learns of a conspiracy behind the true nature of the results. In the future, two television networks compete for ratings by producing violent game shows. One network produces a modern day version of the Roman gladiators, only on motorcycles instead of chariots, and uses convicted murderers as the participants, The network decides it needs a champion for this sport, so they frame a constant winner from another game for murder, and place him on the show.—Humberto Amador In the 21st Century, convicts sentenced to death are forced to fight each other in a futuristic version of the Roman gladiator games. One innocent prisoner discovers a cover-up headed by a greedy TV station manager staging the gladiator games just for TV ratings.—<jonas.urve@mailbox.swipnet.se> Rome, Italy, The 21st Century. WBS TV's chief of programming, Cortez (Claudio Cassinelli), is fuming at the constituently high ratings enjoyed by a rival American companys show, 'Kill-Bike' contests The show has features gladiatorial fights to the death on motorcycles, and has made a hero of a man called Drake (Jared Martin) the unbeaten champion. Cortez is all the more bitter because it was he who discovered Drake in the first place. WBS's current answer to the American show is 'The Danger Game', a simulation game showing the hallucinations of a contestant experiencing the approach of violent death. Fear, panic, and screaming at the extremely realistic simulations triggers a further increase in the intensity. Unfortunately for the station, even this spectacle fails to compete against the American show.Cortez and his two female assistants, Sybil (Penny Brown) and Sarah (Eleanor Gold) receive a video message from the mysterious station boss, Sam, demanding that they recreate the formula of gladiatorial contest and set them back to where they began: in the Coliseum. Sam orders the WBS station, a sort-of flying saucer controlled by a computer system called Junior, to fly over there and initiate training of the future contestants who will be chosen from the Death Rows around the world. Meanwhile, Drake has been imprisoned for the murder of three men who killed his wife Susan (Valerie Jones) after they broke into his house, and he (conveniently for WBS) is now under the sentence of death for taking the law in his own hands.Drake is brought to the training compound and a detector strip is seared into his wrist. There, he has to contend with the sadistic Chief of the Praetorian Guard, Raven (Howard Ross), and the hostility of the other future contestants. Some of them are introduced; Abdul (Fred Williamson) is an African-American Muslim extremist; Akira (Haruiko Yamanouchi) is a notorious Japanese serial killer; Kirk (Al Cliver) is a German-born robber/killer; and Tango (Tony Sanders) is a Latin American terrorist. Drake also meets an old friend of his from his WBS days, a deformed employee with a fiber optic eye called Monk (Donald O'Brien), who offers Drake some reassurance.The next day, Drake is strapped into a 'hate stimulator' device, designed to measure the point when man can be provoked into murder. Despite the best efforts of the machine, which creates holographic images of his wife's killers taunting him, Drake does not crack. Cortez's assistant, Sarah, is perturbed by this and becomes attracted to the prisoner. Drake soon earns the respect of the other prisoners after facing off in a battle of wits with the vicious Raven, who is impotent to actually harm the prisoners because of the upcoming TV show. Sarah meets and befriends Drake and shows him videotape evidence she has discovered that proves he was set up for his wifes murder merely to get him on the show. A strangely powerful microprocessor smuggled in by Monk facilities an escape attempt. When it fails, footage of Drake and the other prisoners in their escape attempt turns up immediately on the TV news. Who is the mystery cameraman? Raven is given limited access to torture the prisoners with electric shocks. But the harrowing experience bonds the principle gladiators even more. Meanwhile, Cortez is becoming more enraged by Sarah's investigation of Drake.The following evening, Sarah visits Professor Towman (Cosimo Cinieri), the inventor of Junior, the WBS computer system, looking for a way to gain access to the restricted files. The professor has become a mystic and talks about his inevention's soul. Professor Towman gives Sarah a pass-chip to access the computer when he is suddenly murdered by a unseen assailant. Sarah gives chase and sees that the killer is Sybil. But before Sarah can try to capture Sybil, she too is shot and killed by an unseen assailant.Meanwhile, the WBS Gladiator Contest commences, with each contesting racing around the modified arena in modified motorcycle carts fighting in a chariot-like run. Many contestants are killed, including Tango. Suddenly, Sarah interrupts the games by riding into the arena on a motorcycle. She has discovered from the computer chip that Junior will trigger the bracelet devices of all the surviving gladiators to kill them all 20 minutes after the show ends. Revealing this information to Drake and the rest of the men, they mount an attack on the control tower, killing all the guards, including Raven. But most of the gladiators, including Akira, are killed in the assault. Drake, Sarah, Abdul and Kirk break into the main control room and discover that Cortez is found to have plotted the death of the survivors in order to discredit Sam and take over as station head. Cortez is killed by Abdul who shoots him. Then, a computer screen image of the company boss, Sam, appears and informs them that 'Sam' is really just a video projection of the computer, emanating from a space satellite, 200,000 miles above the Earth. The computer knew of Cortez plan but let it happen to a point.The four surviving rebels force entry into the main terminal of 'Sam', with the aid of Sarah's pass key. But Kirk is killed when he unwisely tries to remove his bracelet himself. Then, the three surviving rebels are attacked in the control room by Monk, who is revealed to be the traitor who filmed the escape attempt with a mini-camera built into his eye. After a bitter fight, Drake kills him and Sarah uses some of the information stored on his camera chip to access the destruction codes. In the nick of time, Sam is blown up, and the deadly bracelets are deactivated. With the battle won, Drake and Sarah fly off together in a hover-vehicle to start a new life for themselves, elsewhere."

Christina,1984,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087055/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The world's most notorious heiress and bachelorette is kidnapped from the Italian countryside. Will she survive the ordeal? Christina Von Belle (Jewel Shepard), nicknamed The Playgirl Of The Western World, is a young, dark blonde with a 34-23-34 figure and husky voice, an adventurer and heiress of a large fortune. She drives dangerously a sports car, in a hide and seek game with a young man driver, Patrick (Ian Serra) with whom she finally meets, dazed but parked by the road side, in a meandering mountain road in south France. They share the passion for driving sports cars, and sex.They go to his place, a mountain resort, to spend a swinging evening with a similarly liberal minded couple: Brigitte Reynaud (Carole James) and Max (Tony Isbert).Before going to bed, Christina is taking a bath in the marbled walls bathroom. Christina is already nude when she is attacked from behind by a tall person dressed in a black leather catsuit and black hood, who muffles her screams with one hand, while with the other proceeds to physically pull Christina up and out of the bathtub by arm strength. Christina starts debating in the constricting reverse bear-hug, head butts the attacker, gets free, and delivers an uppercut to the head - but misses. Christina's screams are stopped again with a low punch to her midriff, and she's put in an arm lock. The attacker marches Christina forcefully to the adjoining bedroom. Christina's yelps have attracted the attention of her holiday companions.She calls out, «Patrick, help!» Her lover Patrick comes in a hurry, in and black trousers, with their swinging companions, Brigitte in jeans short shorts and low-cut top, and Max, in blue jeans and a white shirt, and the butler Jean [John in the English version] (Emiliano Redondo), all afraid to interfere because the attacker is controlling Christina with a knife to her throat.Christina acts quickly, stomping with her naked foot on the attacker's black plimsoll, causing enough pain to get free. Christina darts to the large bed and sits there looking, as the two young men attack at once the abductor, disarming him. Once unmasked, it is revealed that the abductor is a blonde woman.«Who are you, what do you want?» asks Patrick. «Who are you?»
Jean has produced a piece of cord to tie up the intruder.
Patrick asks the butler, «Won't you give me the knife?»
Jean looks for the discarded knife, and handles it to Patrick.
Christina has found her wits, and comes forward, already dressed in a large red bathrobe. «Wait! You guys don't have to be polite! You have to ask nicely...» Christina pulls down the zipper of the abductor's catsuit. «Now my friend, I'm sorry we weren't formally introduced. (Opening wide the pans of the catsuit top, and exposing the breasts.) Let's cut the shit, shall we? I don't you to think that I'm after revenge. (Putting the flick-blade's tip to the girl's inside right breast.) After all we wouldn't want to hurt the little and pretty things now, would we?»All the while the abductor has kept visual contact with Christina, and a brave face, as her arms are firmly grabbed from both sides by Patrick and Max, but now she shows fear, and speaks quickly: «I'm Emily (Anne-Marie Jensen), I'm of the 10th of November group. I'll talk if you let me go... I don't want to die! Anything else?»
Christina does not answer, but steps back, apparently pleased.
«You amaze me!» says Patrick, «Jean, tie her up, will you?»But Jean proves not to be very good tying a knot. As the two couples leave the bedroom, Emily bumps her buttocks on him, surprising him, and runs away, hands tied behind her back. Next, she is outrunning everybody on the balcony over the sea, hands free, and making a perfect high dive into the water - and escaping.Next morning, Christina wants to go riding alone, but Jean opposes, considering it too dangerous. She ends up to accept that he goes with her, after he promises to keep away from her that she won't notice him.She spends time riding her brown horse to the beach and along the shore. Then the horse whines, and she notices Jean on his horse on a high dune, signaling two bikers close by, to go get Christina. Christina proves to be a good amazon, but after a long chase through the dunes, a cyclist surprises her by flying the bike from the top of a dune, making her fall off the horse. When Christina stands up, she is immediately grabbed by the two female bikers, who've taken off their helmets. Jean introduces the girl to Rosa [Hilda in the English version] (adult film starKarin Schubert), the Teutonic looking platinum blonde leader of the 10th of November, a lesbian women-liberation group.The 10th of November's headquarters is situated in a discreet private island on the Spanish coast. A large mansion with classic interiors and settings, complete with medieval armory on the walls, and modern comfort. In a games room, several members of the sisterhood are training, under the supervision of a woman dressed in black: two teenagers do judo, Orange Belt versus Blue Belt; two elder Blue Belt girls also do judo, a Blonde versus a black haired girl; two little, masked girls are fencing with foils; and two teenagers in blue suits, and one girl in pink, are doing gymnastics and using an elastic table.The private helicopter lands, bringing in Christina and Rosa. They are received by two group members, two tall girls in black trousers, high heels, and see-through panther shirts - a Black and a Brunette. Rosa is escorted by two henchwomen, who walk hand in hand, dressed in the same form fitting and revealing outfits.Rosa enters the games room, and announces: «These two women shall fight now until one is victorious. The winner's prize will be the personal bodyguard of our lovely guest for one night.»
Christina shows her temper again, by disengaging from the two big biker girls' grip, and shouting at Rosa: «Damn you. I'm not a prize, I'm a person!»
«You've got a big mouth! You think you're superior... (She grabs the rim of Christina's white thin shirt, and rips it down, exposing a firm left breast, and erect nipple.) Underneath, you're like us! But you'll never equal us! (Shouting to the pair of fighters,) Begin!... Go on!»
Meanwhile, the two fighters have taken off the knee boots with spiked heels, helped by the pair of Blue Belts. Rosa back-slaps Christina, hard.
Marie (Helen Devon) a brunette with an Afro hair-style, and light-skinned black Antoinette (Josephine Jacqueline Jones, Miss Bahamas 1979) employ wrestling and judo holds and throws, Marie's panther print shirt disintegrates, leaving her practically topless, but that doesn't stop the fight. Antoinette attacks with even more energy. Marie's fingernails scratch at her opponent's bosom, and rips off the flimsy panther shirt, leaving Antoinette topless as well. A low punch, and a kick when Antoinette is down, leaves the other woman victorious.Rosa acclaims her: «Congratulations, Marie! (Pointing to Christina,) Here's your prize! It was quite a show, wasn't it?» she asks matter-of-factually from her small all female audience - that had been quite vociferous during the fight.
Marie takes Christina back to her room, bathes her, talks to her sweetly, and then takes her to bed. Christina says she doesn't want to, but she has no choice, and Marie tells her, «After this you will not want a man again.». Christina silently accepts Marie's lovemaking, and her eyes take in her female companion's beauty.The next day, Antoinette, despite having been Marie's companion before, is spying the new lesbian couple of Christina and Marie on the mansion's gardens. They are in the woods, by a large tree shade and an artificial lake. Since the prize was to be used for one night only, may be she wants her share now. She comes running at them, calling out, «Hi, you!»Marie tells Antoinette to get lost, pushes her away, and further incenses her by recalling that she has won because she is the superior woman. Christina profits from the argument and when Marie punches Antoinette, she punches Marie hard in the stomach, and tries to run away. A triangular kick and punching fight takes place, and this time it's Antoinette who seems to have the upper hand.Rosa arrives on the run, escorted by a dozen of her followers, to put a stop to the argument. Antoinette tells Rosa she overheard the pair talking of an escape.Christina shouts, «That's a lie!» quite convincingly, though it's true. Marie confesses, eyes on the ground.Christina, in a voice-off narration, tells how she accepted a relationship with her new captor, Antoinette, in order to attempt a new escape. During a stroll through an olive grove, Christina punches Antoinette in the belly and starts running through the sparse woodland. Antoinette catches her easily, applies a reverse bear-hug, and laughingly throws her down with a punch. She straddles the supine girl, rips her clothes off so she can enjoy better her prey. Christina has no choice but to surrender.Christina's submission inspires Antoinette to take her for a picnic at the beach. Christina, in a white dotted blue bikini, notices a small yacht approaching the island in the horizon. She walks nonchalantly to the sea shore, then, runs into the water and starts swimming fast away from the beach. Antoinette is topless, though wearing a knife sheathed in a large belt. She gets wise to the girl's plan, and swims after her with powerful strokes. Apparently it is Christina's chance, as the small boat is coming in her direction, with three men on board, the pilot and two sailors in typical Mediterranean striped shirts, blue and white for the younger.They stop the motor, and take the girl in - which gives Antoinette the chance to reach them, and jump on board from the stem, while the men were all eyes for the brunette in the small bikini. Antoinette manages to kick down the pilot, hit down the sailor in blue striped sweater, and body tackle down the older sailor. But then, Christina bear-hugs her from behind, pulling her off the sailor, and between the two, they throw the lesbian beauty overboard - never to be seen again. The pilot and the sailor in blue are also coming out of their dizziness.They restart the motor, and the older sailor (Vicente del Águila) informs Christina that they are smugglers, and that they are taking her to Mr.Alain (Emilio Linder), for they are poor smugglers, and there is a large ransom for her, to be paid by her family.Alain proves to be a perfect Spanish gentleman with a gourmet chef who also want to collect the ransom... He treats her so well that she forgets that he is only doing that for the ransom. He takes her to a bar in town, featuring the usual flamenco music, and the not so usual topless flamenco dancer... That is followed by a romantic song by Pablo (Enrique Johnson), a very young and handsome man, who takes Christina for the next dance, also with a romantic music. Christina easily finds an ally to help her escape the gentle smuggler. When Alain notices that Christina is no longer at the bar, it's too late for him to get the pair of running away.He persists, and the runaways find a not so fast vehicle to help them cross the mountain road: a truck, driven by an old man (Emilio Fornet). Follows a not realistic stunt scene, in which - without stopping the car - Christina the wild driver takes the wheel, and the old driver gets on the truck's loading box, and between him and Pablo, they keep their pursuers at bay by throwing large cauliflowers at Alain's car windshield. The car chase ends in the midst of comic relief scenes, at the next village main square, just in front of a police station.Christina gives a kiss to a plainclothes police officer (Adriano Domínguez), calling him her savior. Christina seems to have settled with Pablo, but that's not certain - as she has a dream in which she is nude again, and someone is driving toy cars around the valley of her belly and thighs, first a truck with a trailer, then an armored car."

Quilombo,1984,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091816/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Palmares is a 17th-century quilombo, a settlement of escaped slaves in northeast Brazil. In 1650, plantation slaves revolt and head for the mountains where they find others led by the aged seer, Acotirene. She anoints one who becomes Ganga Zumba, a legendary king. For years, his warriors hold off Portuguese raiders; then he agrees to leave the mountains in exchange for reservation land and peace. It's a mistake. Zumbi, a warrior whose mother was killed by Portuguese and who spent 15 years with the Whites, stays in the mountains to lead Palmares. In 1694, the Portuguese import a ruthless captain from São Paulo to lead an assault on the free Blacks. Can Zumbi keep Palmares free?—<jhailey@hotmail.com> Palmares was a 17th-century quilombo, a settlement of escaped slaves in the mountains of northeast Brazil. The story follows a group of plantation slaves, among them Abiola (Tony Tornado), who revolt in 1650 during the Dutch-Portuguese War (1601-1661) and escape to the mountains and the city of Palmares, where they join other former slaves who have already been living there peacefully and autonomously. On arrival, Abiola suggests that Palmares trade with a friendly squatter. The leader of Palmares, Acotirene (Alaide Santos), disagrees, but realizes that she is getting old and times are changing. After consulting a divination tray, she anoints Abiola the new leader and renames him Ganga Zumba and places him under the protection of Xango, who manifests himself though Ganga Zumba in trance. Ganga Zumba goes on to become a legendary king (see Diegues' film ""Ganga"" about the life of this character in particular). Ganga Zumba and his people keep Palmares safe for years.The film introduces other important characters, among them Zumbi (Antonio Pompeu), who was born free in Palmares but was captured as a child and lived as a slave for fifteen years, and Ana de Ferro (Vera Fischer), a white woman who choses to live in Palmares because she had been branded a Dutch collaborator as she had been a prostitute in Dutch-controlled Recife. Zumbi becomes chief warrior of Palmares and leads successful raids but refuses to take Recife, since to hold it would require enslaving the white population. Ana rises to become an advisor to Ganga Zumba. When the Dutch-Portuguese War ends, Ganga Zumba is persuaded by the Portuguese to leave the mountains to live on a reservation in the Cocaú Valley in exchange for peace. Many of the villages and towns of Palmares disagree with this change and choose to remain in the mountains. In the Cocaú Valley, Ganga Zumba is poisoned and killed.The warrior Zumbi emerges as the leader of a new generation at Palmares. Zumbi, unlike Ganga Zumba, demands freedom and independence and refuses to compromise with the Portuguese. Intermittent warfare exists until 1694, when the Portuguese send a decisive force under Domingos Jorge Velho (Maurício do Valle) against Palmares. The quilombo is once again attacked and this time taken by the Portuguese, with most of its inhabitants brutally murdered or enslaved (though the film manages to represent these events without victimizing the people). Although, the movie ends on a low point depicting the death of Zumbi and the destruction of the principal settlement of Palmares, a title card at the end explains that the people of Palmares continued to resist the Portuguese until at least 1797. The film insists that Palmares must continue to live on through memory and by keeping alive the traditions of its people."

Ilija Chvorovic from Belgrade, who spent a couple of years in prison on Goli Otok because of Stalinism, was called for a routine interview at the local police station. There, the interrogator routinely questions him about his tenant, Petar Jakovljevic, a tailor who worked for 20 years in a capitalist state, in France. After a few minutes, Ilija was allowed to go home, but he was so overcome by nervousness and paranoia that he began to doubt Petar. As soon as he returned home, he began to complain to his wife Danica, that they should never have rented him an apartment. Ilija's imagination begins to work and he begins to imagine that Petar could be a terrorist, who wants to overthrow the state. Soon, she starts spying on him, to the astonishment of Danica, who is more concerned about their daughter Sonja, who as a dental graduate has not had a job for years. Ilija calls the state security inspector on the phone and begins to report to him about Petar's movements and some of his encounters with ""suspicious"" people, but he does not take him seriously. Soon Ilija buys a camera with a telephoto lens and starts constantly spying on Petar and his friends, from the spa to walking in the forest. His brother Djura joins him in spying. One evening Ilija appears injured and with torn clothes and tells how someone tried to deliberately run him over with a car while he was on the street, to make it look like an accident. Soon, Danica also begins to support him unreservedly, while Sonja already sees a mentally ill man in her father and does not fall for his demagoguery. They quickly move on to the next step; Djura captures Petar's friends, mostly innocent intellectuals and academics, ties them up and takes them to his basement where he starts beating them and forcing them to confess their guilt and terrorist plans. Petar, who wanted to say goodbye, also returns to the house because he is traveling to New York and asks Danica why Ilija keeps watching him. At that moment, Ilija and Djura burst into the house and tied him to a chair and started slapping him, demanding that he confess everything to them. He tells them they are delusional, but they don't believe him. Djura briefly leaves the house to go get the professor who ""confessed everything"" under the beatings, and Ilija himself continues to question Petar.

In the midst of violent inmates and corrupt officials, her inquiry risks to end suddenly - by her own death. Piero and Louise Rogers are having sex.Meanwhile, two henchmen are paying a visit to Sarah Winters (Enrica Saltutti). One punches her in the face, she sobs and says that she has already told them the truth, and they leave - after one of them places a sachet with drugs in a trinket on the cupboard. Her face is wounded and bleeding, but her first care is to make a phone call - to Piero. [scene cut in the English version]The couple is disturbed by a phone call. Piero, without much ado, hurries Louise out of bed. The couple are on their way to help Louise [as the opening credits roll on] and a couple of detectives arrive at Sarah's home, and arrest her for possession. Meanwhile, Piero's car is ambushed and crushed by a road digger operated by the two henchmen, before the couple have time to jump out of the vehicle.Louisa's sister, Julia (Linda Jones), refuses to believe that her sister's death was an accident, and tries to convince her lawyer that it was a commanded murder by her jealous lover, a mobster named Frank Cuomo, because he discovered she had a young lover. Both the lawyer and the police inspector Paul tell her that with no proof and no witnesses there is nothing they can do.The woman who knows who ordered the double murder, Sarah, is now in prison, in a solitary cell. Warden Landers (Rita Silva) doesn't show any pity for the new prisoner - but Amanda, a guard with a long tress of hair, does as soon as the Warden leaves the cell.Erica Thompson (Ajita Wilson), a tall black girl eager for sex, bribes an old female guard, Laura, to have a sex encounter with a male young guard named Robins (Alessandro Freyberger).Mae West (Leda Simonetti), a blonde inmate with short hair, offers herself to the Warden, and promises to become an informer.During the night, the guard Amanda calls Julia (while the Warden is relaxing after her lesbian sex session) to tip her that someone who knows the truth about her sister's death, Sarah Winters, is in prison. More details, only if she pays ten million lire [equivalent then to $US 6,250; US$ 10,000 in the English version dialogue]. However, the Warden overheard the phone call, and when Amanda leaves the office and pretends that she had just called on her sick mother, the Warden pushes her off the balcony to her death.Erica is in her cell, solving a jealousy problem with her curly redhead cellmate, who is complaining that she loves her, and Erica is having a male lover outside. Soon, Erica stops the argument with a deep kiss, and more.The Warden is in the process of interrogating a blonde prisoner, Eleanor - the harsh way. Actually the girl is refusing to admit it was she who pushed the guard off the balcony, and she keeps refusing - until she has a red hot poker applied to her chest.Prison Governor Trudeau (Cesare Di Vito) receives the Warden, just as he was reading an adult magazine. She tells him that Sarah Winters is still drugged and in isolation, and that Eleanor has just confessed to having killed the guard.Police Inspector Paul pays a visit to Sarah Winters, in the company of the Prison Doctor, but she is in a coma, and can't answer anything.Julia is given the bad news - but her mind is somehow gone to a young man on horseback - Piero.Meanwhile, at the island prison, life goes on as usual, and two girls are in the shower. A guard in military uniform, is chatting with a black hair murderess, who is in for killing a would-be rapist, and she was sentenced to 30 years instead of a more lenient sentence.A fisherman's boat arrives with four new prisoners, that are introduced to the Governor. He shows interest for one tall, black haired girl, who says her name is Serena Evans [seen before in dialogue with a guard, in an editing error], and knows how to cook; she is immediately engaged by him to cook dinner for him and his wife. He introduces him to Mrs. Thompson, a deaf and blind woman, who can speak and welcomes the girl.Another newcomer is Julia - posing as a prisoner - and she's sent to Erica's cell.Meanwhile, the Governor is stripping and fondling the new cook in her room, next to the living room where his wife can't hear or see a thing. The girl puts up some resistance, but not enough. ""I feel like a little muff diving"", the Governor declares as he jumps the poor girl.Erica is trying to make Julia tell her secret: she sees that her hands are not those of a working girl (in both senses of the word) and approaches her with kisses and fondling, to which Julia responds in kind, but not offering answers. Later, they share the shower with other girls.Laura, the old guard, informs Julia that the girl she wanted to meet with has not returned to her cell...A brunette snitch is ganged up by three girls, under Erica's orders. Erica tries again to know who Julia is - as she is certain the bank robber she pretends to be is a lie. The Warden interrupts their conversation in the cell, and accuses Erica for the attack on the brunette. Even without a confession, Erica is taken to the dungeon, and beaten up by two female guards. Then her wrists are tied with rope to a wooden bar on the ceiling, and the Warden opens Erica's shirt, trying to force a confession by mauling her breasts. The girl's resistance brings the hot iron treatment to Erica's chest.""I'm not concerned about the methods you use,"" says the Governor when told by the Warden, ""but about the results.""The Warden goes from his office to the isolation cell, to administer herself one more sedative injection to Sarah, who is clear minded already to say that she knows the Warden is in collusion with Frank Cuomo.In the blonde snitch cell, one of the new girls is starting a revolt movement. Predictably, shortly afterwards, the snitch is naming her companion, Erica Council, and telling her intentions to the Warden. When the girl strips, she seems to feel cold, but soon she is heated up by the Warden's lovemaking.Julia keeps searching for someone who knows of Sarah Winters' whereabouts, now with the kitchen attendants. Soon, a young, long haired brunette cuts her lower leg, and Julia quickly applies a makeshift tourniquet to the leg, and helps take the girl to the infirmary, where she tells the nurse that she has a 3 year education in medical school, and takes over the treatment.The Doctor sends for Julia, and invites her to be his assistant, which she accepts - and asks for a complete list of the prisoners, just to check on each one's vaccination against diseases, of course.The Warden has another intimate conversation with Mae West, the blonde lover.The Tortured Girl we now know is Erica Council, is trying to convince Erica Thompson that she must lead the revolt, but she has her doubts about the success of it.The Governor has another intimate conversation with Serena Evans - after a blurry image of him leaving his wife leads us to suspect that Mrs. Trudeau may not be totally blind.Julia is not blind, and is using her post in the infirmary to watch the Warden's visit to the isolation cell. She recalls (in a flashback) how she reprehended her sister Louise for the life she was living. Julia starts crying, just as the Doctor came in, and tells her he loves her. She reciprocates, and they kiss, as he further explores the black see-through lingerie Julia has under the white gown.Later, when they were back to work, they are interrupted by a curly redhead who claims to have a swelling in her stomach. As soon as Julia leaves, he inspects her, and she promptly confesses that she only wants a few days in the infirmary, away from the stinking cell. She says she'll be very cooperative, and since she is young and cute, the Doctor sends her to the infirmary to keep her ""under observation"".Erica Council is exposing the revolt next steps, and her cellmates, namely the Blonde Snitch, listen attentively.The redhead in the black sweater is surprised by Julia when she was about to access the medicine cabinet. Julia asks her to use her master key to open the grid to the solitary cell, and they go there both, to see the comatose Sarah for the first time.The Warden is again on the bed with Mae West, who has nothing new to tell her - and so she says.Julia administers a counter sedative to Sarah, and tries to communicate with her in vain. Then she goes to her room, where she recalls (in flashback) the young male horse rider, and the owner of the stable - Frank Cuomo, an aging rich man - warning her that her sister Louise could not keep behaving herself as boldly as she had done recently. Louise arrives in time to listen his final words, and she says she will marry him soon. Later, Julia surprises Louise at home having sex with Piero, and the man invited her for a threesome. She slaps him, and delivers Frank Cuomo's warning that Louise must stop seeing Piero, or else.Serena Rigway listens to a conversation between the Warden and the Governor, and looks for Julia to inform her about a plan involving weapons.The young guard Robins pays good money to Erica Thompson for the pleasure of having sex with the tall black girl - again. After sex, Erica takes his pistol, menaces him with it, and shoots him dead.Meanwhile, Erica Council is asking Mae West if the Warden asks many questions when they are together, and Mae says, ""No.""Next time Julia attempts to talk with Sarah, the Warden surprises her, and sends her to the dungeon. Strapped to a wooden bed, Julia suffers the hot iron punishment, too. She faints with the pain.At the Governor's quarters, he is having his way again with the Cook, when Mrs. Trudeau walks in and stabs him repeatedly in the back with a knife - seeing and speaking perfectly. The girl offers to take the murder blame as her own doing, because she can't be serving more than the 30 years sentence she already has.Erica Thompson is in the shower with two other girls, when an old servant brings the news that the Governor is dead.The Warden is also informed of the Governor's death - which postpones her death menace on Julia, who stays bound to her wooden bed. She goes to the Governor's office, and addresses the guards and prisoners via the prison's loudspeakers - she is now the only authority inside the prison...Meanwhile, Julia managed to free her hands, just when Laura, the old servant, came to give her the news, too. Julia sends a message from behind bars via Laura, to Erica Thompson - that Mae West had told everything to Landers. Then, Julia faints again, exhausted after the truncheon beating she had taken from the Warden.Warden Landers gives some instructions to Mae West, and the girl seems pleased to know that Landers is now interim governor. On her way out, Mae West is stabbed to death by the girls in the yard, as they had just been told Julia's message by Laura.By cunning and a surprise karate chop to the neck, Erica Thompson disposes of the only male guard guarding the guns store room. She leads a handful of girls into the Governor's office, takes the phone from Landers, and ells the Minister of Internal Affairs that was on the phone, ""The prison is now ours, and we have things to discuss. [...] We have twenty hostages, men and women, and we'll kill one each two hours if you don't meet our conditions.""Shots are exchanged between the male guards and the women armed with the five shotguns taken from the armory.After another counter injection by the Doctor, Sarah remains enough conscience to spell out that Piero had been crushed to death on Frank Cuomo's orders.As the black Erica spells out her demands, Julia Rogers comes into the office and accuses Landers of preventing Sarah to tell the police who is the murderer of Piero and her sister, Louise. Not noticing that the loudspeakers system is on, Landers grabs the shotgun from the desk where the black leader had put it to talk on the phone, and tries to take over the command of the situation. The Doctor comes in, and shows no fear of Landers' shotgun. ""You can't shoot us all. I'm turning you in.""Landers was about to shoot the Doctor, when Erica Thompson throws a knife into the Warden's chest. She falls, dying, by in a reflex move, she pulls the trigger and the shot goes into the tall black leader's belly. Both die - slowly.For Julia and the Doctor, it seems there'll be a future."

He goes to the city where he's attacked by a crowd of workers. At the beginning, the DA are threatening towards Lee (Marcia Holley, Kane Hodder and Alan Marcus). Lee leaves and saves Yogi (Rae Dawn Chong) from a biker attack, who at the beginning didn't even want to tell him her name. They have to hide behind wall from other crazy bikers. At a warehouse, Frankie (Pamela Ludwig) tells Mick (Darrell Larson) that they have found cat food which humans can eat.Carver (Robby Benson) wants to control the city as a first step to control the whole world.

The Funeral,1984,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0089746/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"When Wabisuke's father-in-law unexpectedly dies, the family goes through a series of events and occurrences as the funeral unfolds over three days in their home. At the beginning of the film the father-in-law of the protagonist dies unexpectedly of a heart attack. The remainder of the film is episodic, moving from one incident to another over the course of the three-day funeral, which is held (as is customary) in the home. These incidents contrast old ways and new ways, young and old, ritual ceremony and true feelings, often comically, but sometimes with real poignancy.—Doug Shafer <dsshafer@uncc.edu> Synopsis of The Funeral (Osôshiki , 1984), a nice Japanese movie.The film depicts a 3-day period following the death of husband/father/father in law/brother/uncle. During those 3 days the funeral is prepared and held. It is a pleasantly paced movie that gives a small insight into Japanese customs that slowly disappear. The IMDB score of 7.2 is justified.Some scenes are very comical. For example the one in which the older brother of the deceased strolls in the room where the others are negotiating the procedures of the funeral. The older brother is still looking for the north, because the deceased should lie with his head towards the north. A good example of old versus new. A scene that could have well be taken from a movie by Jacques Tati.The main characters are husband and wife Wabisuke Inoue and Chizuko Amamiya. They are played by two wonderful actors. The man by Tsutomi Yamazaki, the woman by Nobuko Miyamoto. Yamazaki also plays in movies like Tampopo and Departures (Okuribito, 2008). In Departures he plays an undertaker with a very warm heart, very human and very respectful (also as a teacher for his new employee, a cello player).
Miyamoto and Yamazaki play together in other movies. For example in A taxing woman (Marusa no onna, 1987), a very entertaining movie in which they play antagonists that have a certain sympathy for each other.When the father in law got ill, he was rushed to hospital, it's raining cats and dogs. He passes away, quite unceremoniously. The family doesn't know quite well what to do next. They call an undertaker who, indeed, takes care of the undertaking. A coffin is bought. A special model with two little doors in it, they can be opened to take a look at the face of the deceased.
Against his will, the body in the coffin is brought to the house of the son in law and his wife (one of the customs the family was not yet aware of). They find a place in the living room to lay out the body, and build an altar. Actual grief is far to find though.During the second day a lot of people, family, friends, neighbors, are visiting and paying their respects. The whole atmosphere seems to be more merry than solemn. There is food and sake for everybody. During those visits, the son in law takes the opportunity to watch a DVD with a course in how to give the last respects. Some moments later, guests arrive who use the exact same words to show their respects. One can ask oneself how sincere it all is.
In the afternoon, the sister in law of Wabisuke Inoue seduces him in the garden. It seems to happen against his will, but happened it did!Then there is the priest to be dealt with. The family has no clue how much money to give the priest. The amount they have in mind seems huge. Moments later the priest arrives, driven by a private chauffeur in a Rolls Royce. During his visit, the priest is the least modest person around.Then the final evening vigil arrives. The house is full with a colorful company of all ages. There is food and beer in abundance. The atmosphere is merry and even the widow seems to be having a very good time. People sing and drink. Another scene that could be from a Jacques Tati movie. Late in the night, the visitors leave and leave a trail of noise.The day of the funeral is very windy and again contains Tatiesque moments. Especially the talk the family has with the stoker of the cremation furnace, a lugubrious scene. The film ends with a very tender and magnificently beautiful speech by the widow."

Sakura sends him home with some tranquilizers to allow him to sleep. Later on in the day, Sakura realizes she gave Onnsen-Mark laxatives instead, and rushes to his place to tell him. However, she instead finds him in his apartment, filled with dust and overgrowth as if it hasn't been inhabited for years.Sakura takes Onnsen to a small cafe, where he explains that he feels like time is repeating itself. Sakura explains that he must be overworked, but soon, neither can recall what the day is. They then head back to the high school, where they eerily see the previous days' events play out in classroom 2-4.Onnsen then orders the school to be vacated and sends everyone home. Almost everyone attempts to get home, but strangely, find their way barred or find themselves returned to the school.Sakura attempts to call Onnsen at the school, but receives no response. She then takes a taxi, but soon comes into a strange conversation regarding time and space with the cab driver. Sakura suspects that there is more to this driver than meets the eye, but before she can react using her spirit scepter, a flash of light appears, and the driver appears to be normal.With no way to go home, everyone convenes at the Moroboshi residence where Ataru and Lum are (who happen to be the only ones who made it home). It is here that Lum's cousin Ten also shows that he was given a strange little pig by an unknown person. The pic looks rather odd, and has a little tag around its neck with the letter ""C.""The next day, strange things begin happening on the way to school. Ataru (unnoticed) sinks into a puddle of water, and pops up in the school swimming pool, along with Mendo's tank. Shinobu encounters a strange vision regarding wind chimes as well. That evening, the group decide to investigate the high school at night. However, their investigation reveals the school to now hve 4 stories (when it should only have 3), and gravity and space-time inside are inverted and turned around in all sorts of directions.When the group finally makes it out of the school, Sakura is sure that if they attempt to try and go home again, they'll end up back at the school. Mendo directs them to a noodle shop with a secret garage in it's basement. in the garage is a Harrier Jump-jet, that the group takes off in. However, when they get a ways above the city, everyone is shocked to see that the province of Tomobiki-cho is on a circular disc on the back of a turtle, floating through space. The group also zooms in under the disc, noting that there are two giant statues holding it up on the turtle's back: one of Onnsen-Mark, the other of Sakurambo, Sakura's uncle (who she noted had seemed to disappear recently). Suddenly, the Harrier begins to lose fuel, and Mendo flies the plane back to the city. With fuel runnning out, Mendo sets the plane down in the closest area: right outside the residence of the Moroboshi's.The story then cuts to some time later on (an exact time-frame is never given). Since then, the world around our group has fallen into disrepair. The Moroboshi's house has become the main residence for everyone. What is just as surprising, is that the house still functions properly, with water and heat...and in a strange instance, Mr Moroboshi even gets his daily paper!A convenience store also has survived, and magically seems to never run out of food or items. Though it seems noone runs the store, the group still believes in leaving IOU's regarding their food purchases.People deal with the end of the world in different ways. Shutaro has found his Leopard Tank, and spends his days driving around, firing its cannon. Sakura soon moves out on her own, and opens a small noodle shop. The father/son team of Mr Fujinami and Ryunnosuke reopen their Hama Tea Shop near the ruins of the school. The majority of everyone else spends their time just enjoying the atmosphere, as well as lazing about and eating.One day, Shutaro stops by the ruins of a small gas station, and comes across a small water tap, that seems to yield nothing. Shortly thereafter, Shutaro watches as Lum appears, and tries the tap. Amazingly, it begins running cold water at full blast! Suspiciously, Shutaro asks Lum just what she thinks of the world around them, and she cheerily says that it's a fun place.A couple days later, Shinobu and Ryunnosuke both go missing, but noone can find them. Shutaro gets a hunch, and with Sakura's help, goes over the lip of the platform holding the city up. He soon finds an enormous statue of Shinobu, in the same support position as they saw with Sakurambo and Onnsen-Mark. Sakura surmises that a statue looking like Ryunnosuke must be nearby. Sakura feels that of all the others in this world, she will be the next to disappear.Later that evening, Sakura invites Ataru to meet her in the ruins of the old schoolhouse. Ataru shows up, but soon encounters Shutaro, who insists they talk. Shutaro then explains that he was using the firing of his tank's cannons to measure the circumference of the giant disc where the remnants of Tomobiki-cho reside. According to his measurements, the Moroboshi house is the exact center of this ""universe.""Ataru eventually reveals what is on Shutaro and Sakura's mind: that they are basically living in a dream-world. Shutaro is angered at how Ataru can live in such a world knowing it is a lie, but Ataru claims that they don't even know whose dreamworld it is. Shutaro then plays a 'process of elimination' game, and gives his explanation as to whose world it is: Lum's.Ataru doubts this, but Sakura also brings up the fact that they have not accounted for the person that made Lum's dream a reality. She then claims it is Ataru, who vehemently denies it, until Sakura explains that the Ataru she is talking to is a fake. The 'real Ataru' emerges from the shadows, and the 'false Ataru' is revealed to be a being named Mujaki, who is a dream demon.Sakura quickly recounts that Mujaki has been said to have caused many of mankind's great downfalls through history. Mujaki explains that he feels he is considered a menace for no particular reason. He explains that he did create good dreams, but they all eventually become nightmares. In hopes to one day create a pure dream that would last, Mujaki's wish seemed to be granted when he encountered Lum at an aquarium one day. Mujaki notes that Lum appears sad, and they soon start talking. Mujaki explains his want to create good dreams, and offers to make Lum's dream come true. Lum then explained to Mujaki that her dream was to live 'happily ever after with Ataru and his friends.'Shutaro and Sakura are then surprised to find themselves trapped in an alternate dimension, having been lulled into submission by Mujaki's story. Mujaki explains the story was true, and gloats that the dreams of those who have been trapped hold up the disc where the city is. Each of the people who has been turned into a giant stone statue gets their dream in return: Ryunnosuke (who is actually a girl) is recognized as a feminine figure, Shinobu eventually ends up with Shutaro, Onnsen-Mark has a relationship with Sakura, and Sakurambo is able to fulfill his enormous appetite.However, Mujaki is so blinded into thinking he's taken care of almost all the loose ends, that he fails to realize he hasn't taken care of Ataru. Mujaki is about to, when Ataru proposes a deal (given that he has one of Sakura's spiritual scepters that could cause Mujaki harm), and Mujaki gives into Ataru's dreamworld of a woman-filled harem.Mujaki thinks he's quelled Ataru, until Ataru notices that Lum is not a part of his harem, and demands she be included lest he wreck the dreamworld. Exasperated by this demand, Mujaki accidentally drops a horn that can call the dream-eating spirit named Baku. Ataru gives Mujaki one more chance to include Lum, but upon his refusal, Ataru blows the horn.Unknown to the others, Baku is actually in disguise as the little piglet that Ten had found, and upon being summoned, begins to fly about the dreamscape, sucking it up and tearing it to pieces. Ataru is sucked up as well, but encounters Sakurambo, who strikes Ataru on the head to try and wake him up.Ataru then awakes in Mendo's transport vehicle, thinking that he dozed off while he and Mendo went to pick-up food for the others at the school. However, it soon becomes apparent that this is a dream concocted by Mujaki, who it turns out is the vehicle's driver. Ataru manages to knock out Mujaki, but not before the vehicle crashes, throwing Ataru into a wrecking ball.Ataru then wakes to find he's in the tag game that decided the fate of the world between him and Lum. Ataru is just about to win, when he suddenly remembers that his winning caused Lum to be brought into his life. When Ataru fails to win the tag game, the viewers on the sidelines come forward and pummel him to death.Ataru next awakes in the victorian era, brought back to life as ""Franken-Ataru."" Ataru then encounters Mujaki, and the two attempt to kill the other, before both end up collapsing.Ataru then awakes in a future where he and Lum had been frozen until a cure for an unknown disease was found for them. However, a technical malfunction hsa caused Lum to die several hundred years prior, and Ataru rushes out of the room yelling...only to realize that it was all a constructed set by Mujaki.Mujaki then knocks Ataru out, and the two soon find themselves in a world of helixes spinning through a green space. Mujaki promises Ataru that if he will play by his rules, he'll make lots of good dreams for him.As Ataru ponders this, a little girl in a white dress and large hat appears, and explains to Ataru that she knows how he can wake up. If he jumps off of his current resting place, and calls out the name of the one person he most wants to see, he'll wake up. Ataru claims that there are lots of women, but the little girl then reveals her face to be a youthful version of Lum, telling him to 'do the right thing.'Ataru then plummets to Earth, calling out every single girl's name he can think of, but nothing works. At the last minute, he shouts out Lum's name, and lands in classroom 2-4, where everyone is still asleep...even himself.Ataru wakes himself up, and Lum wakes up soon after claiming she had a wonderful dream. Ataru almost kisses Lum, until he turns and sees everyone watching. With all eyes on him, he refuses to do so, even though Lum insists that he can if he loves her. Ataru, trying to act macho and 'typical,' still refuses, causing Lum to zap him.The film then ends with a couple workers commenting on Ataru and Lum never learning, and that they will continue their emotional games for the rest of their lives. A third worker is revealed to be Mujaki, who tells the audience that keeping up with Lum and Ataru takes more work than usual. The camera then pulls back as a sign hanging over the school entrance shows the title of the film."

Michael Landon's semi-autobiographical sketch of his earlier life. It's the story of Gene Orowitz, a high school student struggling with his bed-wetting, who finds success as a distance runner on the track team.—Anonymous At twilight, a small airplane touches down the runway of an airport in Collingswood, New Jersey. Coming out of the plane is famed movie director Gene Orman, who is in town to attend the premiere of his latest film. Before they reach the theater, Gene requests his limo driver to stop outside his childhood home. He gets out and tearfully looks ahead as we flash back thirty years earlier, where we see him as a shy teenager named Eugene Orowitz, struggling with his identity and his parents, sharp-tongued mother Harriet and Sam, the bullied manager of the local movie theater, who was unable to pursue his dreams of becoming a screenwriter.Bonnie, Eugene's girlfriend, instantly falls for new transfer student Bob Woods. That night, at the theater, Bob's constant horseplay disrupts Eugene and Bonnie's viewing of a movie that Sam comes over and escorts him out, and when Gene later walks Bonnie to home, Bob and his cronies show up at her house and Bob challenges Eugene to a fight, but chickens out. Embarrassed and humiliated, Eugene walks home alone, but is met by some schoolmates who take him to a local bar to drown his sorrows over the possible breakup of Bonnie, but they get into a restroom fight with a brutish patron, with the boys managing to escape the bar before the cops are called.Later, at home, Eugene is making a sandwich in the kitchen when Sam comes in. Eugene emotionally tells him that he chickened out to a fight and unable to defend Bonnie's honor. Sam tells him he knows how Eugene feels because he has a dictator of a boss, Jake Bellow, who berates him in front of all the co-workers, but because he values his job, he has no choice but to take it. To change his image, he starts private javelin throwing classes with Coach Sutter, who gets more impressed with Eugene that Sutter signs him up for local track meets and lights up the attention of schoolmate Cathy Stanton. One night, Gene sits through a double showing of Samson and Delilah and when leaving, he observes the film's poster outside the theater and believes he should start growing his hair to not lose his strength and confidence. The next day, Cathy, fearing Eugene's grades are starting to slip, meets up and offers to help tutor him.At this time, Eugene's hair is growing longer and it does not sit well with his school principal, Mr. Collins, who orders to get his hair cut or be barred from future track meets. That night, an angry Harriet, after receiving a phone call from Collins, goes off on Eugene and thinks he is crazy for letting his hair grow, but Sam manages to understand where Eugene is coming from when Sam notices him carrying two heavy trash cans over his shoulder for the night's garbage collecting. The next day, Sam takes Eugene to see his brother, Joe, a famous physician. Sam agrees to help him as long as he keeps it a secret from everybody, including Harriet and Cathy. They come home, much to Harriet's horror, to see Eugene's head wrapped in bandages to cover up the long hair, but he tells Harriet he is fine and goes to change for practice.To celebrate his winning of a recent track meet, Eugene takes Cathy to a drive-in restaurant. As they leave, they get into a fender-bender with Bob and Bonnie in the car behind them. Bob again challenges Eugene to a fight and he clocks Bob with one punch, sending him to the ground. Shocked, but amazed, Eugene and Cathy happily leave, as Bob struggles to get up. This gives Bonnie a chance to try and win Eugene back, but turns her down. Later, Eugene meets Sam at the theater and tells him about a possible scholarship to USC if he wins a track meet on Saturday. This causes Sam to finally stand up to Bellow, who allows him to take no more than two hours off to see Eugene perform, but Cathy also worries about their relationship if he gets the scholarship, but the two make a pact to stay close forever. Sam is also worried, too, but tells Eugene he loves him very much, either way.The next day, at the track meet, Eugene and Cathy anxiously wait for Sam, who is forced to load film cans to the theater when a delivery truck breaks down. Unfortunately, the heavy lifting becomes too much for Sam to handle and collapses with a heart attack. Shortly after, a policeman shows up to bear the bad news to Eugene and Cathy and offers them a ride to the hospital. Distraught, Eugene walks over and peels off the bandages, revealing a huge head of hair. He grabs the javelin and throws it clear across the field. At the hospital, he and Cathy meet a devastated Harriet. She fears that she and Eugene will not make it on their own and he agrees to go in to talk to Sam. The doctor tells Eugene they numbed Sam to get rid of the pain, but not certain if a heart transplant is possible. Eugene tells Sam the good news about the scholarship and Sam tells Eugene to look at a script he worked on for the last few months, but before Eugene can ask what it is about, Sam's life support system flat-lines and Eugene rushes to get help.The film then flashes back to the present time where Gene's friend Cy is explaining the delay to an assistant on the limo's phone. Cy tells Gene they need to rush to the theater before the show starts. When they arrive, Gene is greeted by many fans and is met by Cathy, who tells him Harriet is in the lobby signing autographs and Gene and Cathy are met by an older and friendlier Bellow, who is honored to have Gene at the theater. Waiting years to pay Bellow back, Gene tells him that some of the marquee lights are out and orders him to fix them himself. As Gene and Cathy walk inside, Bellow looks up at the marquee saying the movie's title, Sam's Son, which he gives a sarcastic reaction."

Kony,1984,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0309778/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Kony is an inspirational story of a coach Khidda and his trainee Kony who fight all odds to achieve their aims. Khidda (Soumitra Chatterjee) is a swimming coach who teaches swimming to underprivileged kids. He picks Kony (Sriparna Banerjee) from a slum of Calcutta and grooms her to be part of the Bengal Swimming team to compete at the National Swimming Championship. However, politics, poverty and social stigma emerges as distinct roadblocks in their path.—Swarup Basak 1) Koni is a young girl from a poor family; Khsitish Sinha is an experienced swimming coach. One day Khsitish sees Koni swimming and thinks she can be an excellent swimmer. Koni does not have the money to hire a coach. Khsitish decides to coach her for free but because his family is also not rich, he adopts her and puts her to work in a tailor shop. After struggling to learn how to properly swim competitively, Koni makes it onto the Bengal national swimming team. She is not selected to compete in any events until a team member is injured. Koni takes first place in the swimming competition, Kony is a great inspiration for children and adults2) I opine that this book is the best Indian sports novel. The sports journalist - Moti Nandi has creatively brought up the fact of hidden talent. There are many people out there who in spite of having a talent can't excel in their domain due to lack of economy and resources.The main themes of this book revolves around love for sports, hard work, dedication and the role of a teacher in the course of a student's success. Koni with all her power and hard work fights against all the obstacles and made the whole of Bengal proud whereas the character of Khitish Singha as her trainer showed the role of a perfect teacher3) The inspiring story of Hima Das led us to Koni, Bengali writer Moti Nandy's heartwarming tale of a young girl who fights social prejudices and material challenges to emerge as a champion swimmer------The reed-thin teenager is spotted first during her skirmishes in the Ganges by coach Sinha who again bumps into her during a non-stop walking contest she entered to earn money for her family.The temperamental coach, who has been forced out of his club of three decades, is looking for a charge he can shape into a future champion.Thus starts the unlikely association between an unwilling but stubbornswimmer and an indomitable coach who is convinced of the potential of the starving girl he bullies into learning the proper technique of swimming.In many ways, Koni is a story that will inspire even the most cynical of us as the underdog battles poverty and the web of petty politics that are the bane of sports bodies.Mukherjee keeps the tale moving in a simple narrative that captures well the frustration of defeat as well as the subdued elation of winning. Having been denied the chance to swim for her state, abused by team mates and summarily left to thaw on the stands at a national meet, Koni's fight back to glory is a feel-good ""grit and determination always wins"" tale, that Nandy is known for scripting.The book will appeal to a teenage audience with its easy language andinspiring story of a girl who refused to make poverty an excuse to achieve her potential.-------THANK YOU-------

But on this particular day, when Madan and his friends rise from their slumber, some with the customary hangover, they are not so perturbed to find no water in the taps again, as when they hear that it is not going to be a holiday after all. Instead there will be a lecture in the auditorium by the Chairman of the Board (Dr. Shriram Lagoo), on the day of the festival of fire, Holi, and the boys decide not to attend the classes. The hostel superintendent Professor Singh (Naseeruddin Shah), the only lecturer with some human links with the students, watches with apprehension their growing restlessness. A notice announcing a further postponement of examinations adds to the bitterness. A fight erupts out of nowhere between principal Phande's (Om Puri) nephew and another student, in which the principal's nephew is hurt and the other boy is promptly rusticated.

As these items are passed, sold, or stolen from one character to another, a giddy round dance of excess begins to take shape, one which suggests that if history doesn't repeat itself, it certainly rhymes. Together with co-writer Gérard Brach, whose other co-writing credits include Repulsion and Tess, Otar Iosseliani uses a feather-light touch to expose the futility of class and social order, making a bagatelle of the concerns of rich and poor alike.—Anonymous"

The Snowdrop Festivities,1984,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086319/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"This movie is based on texts of Bohumil Hrabal, world-known Czech prosaic. It's a story (in a form of a mosaic of short episodes and pictures) about the sadness and happiness of inhabitants of Kersko (Kersko is a small woody area full of cottages and roods). These people are both simple and sensitive, they have their own pleasures (e.g. Leli is a collector of cheap, but inutile things) and the greatest delight of all of them is a hunting. Crude poetics of amateur hunting is screened by dreamy pictures of this area. Menzel mixes sentimental lyricism and rough (but not vulgar!) humor and the outcome is the never-ending landscape of continuous life in the proximate nearness of nature. The performances of actors are brilliant. Both Rudolf Hrusinsky as a Franz and Jaromír Hanzlik as a Leli have nonrecurring charm bottomed on a pain and inebriation. Only the music is not perfect: Jiri Sust usually assembled his film music from his older works and in this movie there is many quotations.—AnonymousB"

The Diamond Connection: Diamanti che scottano,1984,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0243217/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Crashed and sunken in a murky sea, a passenger plane had a very special package... a briefcase full of diamonds. These illegally acquired and transported missing diamonds become an irresistible challenge to a few interest groups. They will kill, deceive, and plot to capture the diamonds for themselves.—Anonymous A plane crashes into the water of the Bosphorus channel due to a thunderstorm. The only survivor is in shock, lost his memory, and his face is unrecognizable - though well repaired by a woman surgeon. His daughter, a police inspector, the lady surgeon, two nurses, a formula 1 car racer and his estranged wife, an Arab sheikh and a number of other people are after this man - or rather, the diamonds that he was carrying for an arms-for-diamonds deal in to further the cause of a revolutionary group. By the end, they'll know that diamonds kill more than guns.—Artemis-9 Alan Roberts, Formula 1 racing driver, complains about the car's transmission, and the lack of help from his wife's supervision of the Formula 1 car race from an helicopter. His friend Lorenzo Savoldi had been measuring the time of each passage of the car in the circuit - and around him are his young son and his beautiful wife of dark complexion.(As the credits roll) Lorenzo and his son are aboard a yacht, with a Blonde in a Bikini, watching Alan with three men in a sailing boat, and the same helicopter is flying around.As Jessie, Alan's wife, sets foot on the ground after landing the helicopter, she asks, ""Have you any news from Ferguson?"" His flight from the Middle-East has been delayed. Meanwhile, in a hospital in Istambul, Karen, a lady doctor, welcomes the arrival of a Nurse dripping wet from the rain, as they prepare for work.Over the Bosphorus, during the night, a passenger plane is hit by the thunderstorm. Mr. Kemal, a man very precise about the exact time displayed by his watches, receives a phone call via radio, informing him first hand of the plane crash. ""Another one! With these storms they're dropping off like flies,"" his informant says. Mr. Kemal mumbles, ""We'll only have to dig up the Bosphorus...""A private team - a yacht and a helicopter - are immediately at the crash scene. At the hospital, the only survivor is in bed, his face covered up in bandages. On the bedside table, a portable radio informs him of the plane crash, and the names of two important passengers that were on board, and are presumed dead: Arthur Ferguson the Lawyer, and George Truman the Geologist. This brings him a flashback memory of what happened aboard the plane, moments before the crash. Ferguson, afraid of perishing, gives his daughter's visiting card to the man sitting next to him, and asks him to give her his briefcase that he has attached to his left wrist, in case he dies. Then, the plane does crash.Doctor Karen is all smiles to her patient, whom she addresses as Mr. Ferguson, and informs him that he was found in a state of shock and badly disfigured after a plane crash. She has taken care of his facial injuries, but he is unrecognizable. His loss of memory does not prevent him from demand that his daughter be warned in Geneva. Doctor Karen says she will do so, ""to the address on the visiting card"" he was carrying. Karen calls on the Ferguson's home in Geneva, where Magda Ferguson is in bed with Alan Roberts.Alan goes to a girls' ballet class, conducted by his wife, and tells her bluntly that Ferguson is in Istanbul for the past three days, after his plane crashed. By chance, Lorenzo walks in, holding page one (and only) of a French language newspaper stating that there was only one survivor of the plane crash. The way Alan's Wife orders him to go to Istanbul, ""if he is interested in the diamonds"", it's clear that there is something else to their relationship. By the door, Lorenzo's son and half a dozen of the ballet girls are listening... Lorenzo addresses Alan's wife Jessie as ""darling"", and she refers to her husband who's just left, as ""that creep"".Late that evening, at a Geneva disco, Harry, a man in a black suit, and his Bodyguard, in a light yellow shirt, are searching for information. A waiter directs them to a man who has been asking questions about Ferguson. Harry invites the man - Alan - to follow him to a private area to discuss about Ferguson, and there without any talking, Harry attacks Alan, and a brawl starts involving Lorenzo, the Bodyguard, and a number of customers. Lorenzo's wife and son are there, but keep away from the fighting.Alan and Magda Ferguson fly over to Istambul, and visit ""Ferguson"" in the hospital, still in bandages. He does not recognize Alan Roberts, and his daughter asks him whether ""he did not forget about the briefcase... the one chained to his wrist, with the diamonds in it"".
He does not remember. She tells him that those diamonds were to be handed to the Emir, for the Arab to buy guns. The patient is confused: ""But who am I?""
Alan intervenes: ""You're a great lawyer, working with big industrialists."" Then, the patient signals the visitors to lower their voices. ""There may be microphones!""
Magda conducts a brief search for microphones in the obvious places, and finds none. But obviously, a Lab Technician is listening in an adjoining room via a small, hidden microphone.
Magda tells her father of the phone call he had made to her from the airport before taking the flight from Koweït - and now in flashback we know that Ferguson's call to his daughter had been overheard by George Truman - the man who is actually Karen's patient. But Magda seems to be suspicious of her father's behavior. Alan tells him that Mark from Amsterdam is also in this, ""to help with the guns"", and that Mark had been in prison for drug pushing, while Ferguson was stuck in Koweït.The Police Inspector pays a visit to ""Ferguson"", and Karen tries to extract information from him, but he politely declines. On the Bosphorus, a boy aboard a yacht takes a call at a mobile phone, and passes it to a man who looks like his father, with a whistle: ""Sammy! It's Istanbul.""
Magda Ferguson is calling Sam, to hire his services. Alan is with Magda and suggests they call Mark, too.Next day, at the airport, they receive Mark, who comes with his lover, Jenny, a girl with short hair. Spying on their encounter is Harry, too. Shortly after, he takes pictures of the next man to arrive, Sam. But this time, Alan notices him, and gives chase by car, out of the airport and through the meandering Turkish roads. Harry's car has an accident, but he gets out of it uninjured, and manages to escape on foot.Magda has a meeting with Alan, Sam, and Mark in her room at Harem Hotel, while Jenny dances to a light tune on the radio, not paying attention to their conversation.""Ferguson"" escapes from his room, and makes a phone call from the hospital's public phone to someone to set a meeting at Harem Hotel the next day. But his conversation is overheard again by the Laboratory Technician.
Shortly after, two men pay a visit to Mark's hotel bedroom, and abduct Jenny - just in time, as Mark was coming back to join her. He finds a note, giving him rendez-vous at the pier.Jenny wakes up from sedation on a fishing boat, where a fisherman with bad teeth introduces himself as Mustapha (uncredited), offers her food, and tries to fondle her, all in quick succession. She beats him away, and tries to get out of the boat, fights a man, but is captured.On the pier, Alan sees Harry, armed with a pistol, but the Arab hides again in the marina. They're both being watched, unseen, by the Laboratory Technician.Mark buys the information about the whereabouts of Jenny from a sailor at the marina, and then swiftly attacks the boat with the help of Alan and Sam. They fight four men and than a Skipper (uncredited) in white uniform.
From the pier, Harry shoots the Skipper dead before Alan and his friends can extract information from him under torture.
They liberate Jenny, and discover that the boat was carrying a lot of weapons, enough to arm a small army. Jenny says that ""These people want the diamonds, that's all!... They told me I could go if they got the stones.""Meanwhile, ""Ferguson"" leaves the hospital in a taxi, with his daughter, still with the bandages protecting his face.Alan greets the arrival of ""Ferguson"" at the hotel, saying that ""It's good to see you on your feet again."" ""Ferguson"" does not recognize him -again - and his daughter introduces him to the persons present: Mark from Amsterdam, and Sam ""who is sometimes called the Karate Professor"". She does not mention Alan, nor Sam's companion Jenny. Their meeting is being discreetly observed by the police.Laura Truman engages the services of Omar the Skipper for an underwater search. He shows her the scene of the crash, that he had witnessed.
She gives him a stash of money as an advancement for his work. But their conversation is also being observed by Kemal and an assistant. ""White Swan calls Black Eagle,"" he says over radio to the Nurse at the hospital - thus revealing her as a an undercover police agent.
Meanwhile, Mark invading the bathroom when his wife was already taking a shower, and gently forces her to share the shower with him. (Sex scene cut from the video editions.)""Ferguson"" was about to take his bandages in front of a mirror in his hotel room, when he is assaulted by a man with a flick-blade and his face hidden with a white hood. He has been sent by Abdul Pasha, to make him pay for ""those diamonds"". ""Ferguson"" fights back, they struggle, ""Ferguson"" applies a judo arm lock on the attacker, and cuts his throat with his own knife. The man also carried a revolver with a silencer, and Gori arms himself to pay a visit to the next room - where Sam is sleeping - and makes a search in the wardrobe, and in a storeroom. Then he goes back, as silent as he entered.Sam had pretended to be asleep, and checks his diving equipment - noticing a magnetic piece attached to an oxygen bottle for scuba diving. In his pajama trousers, he goes out expecting to surprise his strange visitor, but he is ambushed by him instead.
""Ferguson"" stands back, while three other men attack Sam. He knocks two out, and ends up in the hotel's swimming pool fighting with the third man. Alan intervenes, attacking the other men. All the attackers are allowed to escape.""Ferguson"" goes back to his room and carries the dead man's body out - to drop it in the swimming pool.
Laura Truman was waiting for him in her car outside - thus revealing he is in fact George Truman, who had called his wife the day before.
He tells her he had placed the bomb in an oxygen bottle, that would explode at 20 feet underwater.The police inquest does not go far: the body in the swimming pool can not be identified, though Karen is sure that he is not her disappeared patient, and only Ferguson's daughter is worried that her father is missing.
Only now do Alan and Magda admit the hypothesis that the survivor may have been faking his amnesia.In a fishing boat, Alan, Mark, and Sam Magda and Jenny arrive to search the plane's remains. But a frogman is already at work, while Laura and George watch from a hill top.
The three partners in frogmen suits with fishing spear-guns jump into the water, while the women stay on board in their bikinis. The three men pass by a shark, see some cadavers inside the cabin through the windows.But the lonely frogman has already found (out of the unbroken cabin structure) a handbag from which he extracts a small jewel box. Mark returns to the boat - and so do the others (off camera).
The lonely frogman swims ashore - with the jewel box - but he is being seen from opposite ends both by the Police Inspector, and by Mark now in his swimming trunks.
The lonely frogman is Omar the Skipper, who changes his rubber suit for his blue jeans and sailor cap, before holding up his trophy, shouting to Laura, ""Hi!""
Mark comes running at him from the opposite end of the beach, and takes him down. They start fighting, rolling on the sand, then stand up and exchange punches.
George shoots with a Luger, hits the man in shorts, and keeps shooting at the people on the boat: Jenny who is screaming for Mark falls dying in the arms of Magda.Laura opens the box and stares at the diamonds, with George sitting by her, behind the driving wheel, while the Skipper is already taking place on the cargo section of the small white truck.Alan appears at the top of the hill, having run from the boat, in his white trousers and black shoes. The uneven road forces the truck to go slow, and Alan tries to jump on board, but the Skipper kicks him off.
But coming from another side of the road, Sam does manage to jump in, and starts fighting with the Skipper. The Skipper ends by punching Sam out of the truck.Alan returns to the boat. Magda tells him that she saw that the shooter was not her father. Alan tells Magda, «I'll put the Jenny next to Mark. Those two lived together, and will be forever together.""
Together, they balance the girl's body overboard into the sea.The GREY HAIRED MAN with his binoculars from a vantage point on the hill, keeps watching these crimes without interfering. This time, he sends the radio message to Royal Eagle, ""Alert! It's time for us to move...""
She says to herself, ""Oh oh!...""
""We have good news..."" says Karen, who was paying attention to the conversation.
The Nurse answers mysteriously: ""Rejoice your freedom because it is mine.""
""Is that now?"" Karen asks.
""It is getting hot.""Alan is calling his wife Jessie. He tells her that the diamonds have been recuperated, but that they are in the wrong hands. She reproves his inability to get hold of them.
He tells her where they can meet, at the ""west beach"" of Silé. She takes the cigar her lover Leonardo was smoking, and inhales from it, once.
Leonardo's wife and son are at the heliport with him, to say goodbye to Jessie.Karen appears at the lobby bar of the hotel at Silé beach, and asks Alan about her patient. Next, the Police Inspector arrives, too, and tells Alan, Sam, and Jessie not to leave the hotel premises until he has solved some troubling points in his inquiry.
Sam tries to make a joke, the Inspector gets irritated: ""An helicopter spotted a body on the coast of Silé, one of your group, and also the body of his girlfriend."" Sam starts denying it, and the Police Inspector calls him apart to an adjoining room, for a proper interrogation. Then, he reveals to his assistant that Sammy is actually Sam Hellman, an undercover Interpol officer.
The Inspector brings him out of the room in handcuffs, to further ensure the protection of his cover. Alan is surprised that the Inspector is not interrogating the others in private, and Doctor Karen says she's going back to the hospital.
Alan goes to his bedroom, and Magda, in a decollete white dress, wants to make love.The GREY HAIRED MAN arrives alone to spy on the villa that looks like an ""eagle's nest"" on a hill. Through the walkie-talkie, he says: ""I'm transferring the information... It corresponds to what you told us. The dolphins started diving. Watch the gentleman and the lady.""
In Silé, there's a discreet surveillance of the hotel, from where Alan and Magda leave in a car.Sam gets a motorcycle from the police, and goes to the villa. He is about to break and enter it, when he is attacked by Alan and Magda. Sam gives them a fantasy explanation about how he managed to get off of the handcuffs, and rob a motorcycle, but they are satisfied with the story.
Alan says that the diamonds are inside the villa, waiting to be split 50/50.
Through the window, they see Laura, in a summer print white tee-shirt, and the Mummy (as Karen called him once) talking, while the Skipper is taking stuff to the boat. Sam intercepts the Skipper, and marches him inside at gun point into the house, being joined by Alan and Magda.Alan and Magda unmask the Mummy, and he declines his identity: George Truman, the Geologist. He had been following Ferguson the Lawyer on orders of the Emir Abdul Pasha (aka Harry), ""who didn't trust him too much"".
Sam pulls at the attache-case that is being held by Laura, but she holds to it, ""I'm his wife, not his daughter."" As if that credited her more to the inheritance.
George says that the diamonds are not in the attache-case. Magda points her revolver at him, and demands him to tell where they are, right away. They hear someone outside, which creates a distraction.Magda starts for the door, but is stopped by Alan who fights with her. The attache-case falls to the ground, and the diamonds scatter on the floor.
Magda and Laura start fighting each other for the diamonds. The Skipper fights Alan, who has a revolver in hand. Sam fights George. He tried to pass himself for Ferguson to get at the diamonds, and since he could not do it by himself, he asked his daughter's help.
The GREY HAIRED MAN runs up to the house by the stairs linking it to the beach, while the fighting goes on.Alan's gun fires accidentally, twice, and Laura is fatally wounded in the back. Hearing a car stopping outside, Sam goes out, pistol in hand, and greets the arrival of Karen, who doesn't show surprise at seeing him, and says she's come to see her patient. Their conversation is listened to by THE GREY HAIRED MAN.
Alan is still fighting with the Skipper, and finally shoots him dead. George holds Laura's head, saying her name in sorrow. Then he looks for the culprits of her death.
He runs outside and stops Magda on the stairs, holding a gun, and the small jewel box; he deflects her armed wrist away, and plunges a dagger three times in her stomach. The girl falls, dying.Alan shoots at him, but George runs away. Sam and Karen watch, as George ambushes Alan, and the two men start fighting again. Karen shoots Magda between the eyes, when the dying girl was about to shoot Sam.
Then Karen goes to her car, about to leave, alone - still being watched by THE GREY HAIRED MAN.Georhe and Alan are still punching each other, and approaching the edge of the cliff, and then George falls off to his death on the rocks below.
Sam starts collecting the diamonds from the floor and replacing them in the jewel box, when Alan hits him on the head.Jessie arrives in the helicopter, late for a hotel meeting, but just in time to lift Alan up with a cinch. Abdul Pasha himself is watching him go, and attempts to shoot him. Karen. is by his side.

Maneuvers,1984,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0242321/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"1980s South African action comedy shot mostly in Afrikaans, one of South Africa's 11 indigenous languages. The main character, played by Arnold Vosloo, is a spoilt young man from a rich family, just finished with school, and conscripted to two years' army service, as most defensible young men were forced to do in the '80s. The movie revolves around the young rebel's anti-establishment antics in frustrating his superiors, trying to avoid military service with his new-found comrades-at-arms, and charming an inquisitive spiky-haired reporter (Janie du Plessis).—Tiaan Joubert This movie is sort of South Africa's answer to 'Stripes' crossed with 'Ballad of the Green Berets', 'Mister Roberts', and 'The Odd Angry Shot'. It has three main characters. Boetie (""Sonny"") van Tonder (played by Arnold Vosloo), the spoiled stepson of a rich South African politician, is an aimless playboy majoring in astronomy at university. His stepfather needs to win an upcoming close bi-election, so he bribes Boetie to join the Defense Force. ""Dampies"" Ball (played by Frank Dankert) is a poor lower-class mechanic with a pregnant wife. He has dodged the draft before and has finally been caught. Both are reluctant to serve and just want to get it over with. Corporal Botes (played by Eric Nobbs), who the pair meet at the front gate of the base, is in charge of training these apathetic recruits. He prefers to speak in Afrikaans rather than English and is a brutal martinet. As a contrast, the Commandant of the post and the other NCOs are shown as being more sympathetic and paternalistic.To spite the corporal, the men feign ignorance and deliberately screw up. After the corporal follows the Commandant's advice to treat his men better and speak in English, the platoon improves and follows his orders. As a reward, the men are allowed to graduate and Corporal Botes is assigned a combat command.The rest of the movie details their service in Namibia during the Border Wars (1966-88). Corporal Botes leads the green recruits in combat against an unseen enemy. In the climax Boetie leads a counter-attack against the enemy and recovers the wounded Corporal, who begrudgingly has come to respect Boetie. In the end, Boetie has matured into a leader because of his service and becomes a better person for it."
