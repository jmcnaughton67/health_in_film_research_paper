Marcus and Mike have to confront new issues (career changes and midlife crises), as they join the newly created elite team AMMO of the Miami police department to take down the ruthless Armando Armas, the vicious leader of a Miami drug cartel. This third 'Bad Boys' film starts with Detectives Mike Lowery (Will Smith) and Marcus Burnett (Martin Lawrence) speeding through the streets of Miami with other cops following them. They arrive at a hospital and run inside as they head to the room where Marcus's daughter Megan (Bianca Bethune) has given birth to a baby boy. His wife Theresa (Therese Randle) and Megan's fiance Reggie (Dennis Greene) are there as well, informing Marcus that the boy is named after him. He proudly holds his grandson.In a Mexican prison, inmate Isabel Aretas (Kate Del Castillo) is muttering an incantation that draws a guard's attention. Isabel grabs a knife off the guard and stabs her, with the other inmates jumping in and stabbing her to death. Other guards take Isabel outside, only for her son Armando (Jacob Scipio) to help her kill off all the other guards. He frees her, and they return to their home to plot revenge on behalf of her late husband Benito, with Mike being their intended final target.Armando goes to the docks to pull out a crate filled with money with intent to work with other gangsters, but these gangsters try to screw him over and take the majority shares of the money. With their guns drawn on Armando, he retaliates by stabbing everyone rapidly. He then orders the remaining men to step up if they wish to work loyally under his family. A crook named Lorenzo Rodriguez, AKA Zway-Lo (Nicky Jam), joins him.Mike and Marcus's fellow officers, including Captain Howard (Joe Pantoliano), gather at a bar to celebrate Marcus becoming a grandfather. They encounter a woman named Rita (Paola Nunez), who has just been promoted to lieutenant and is also Mike's ex. She informs them that she is also now heading AMMO (Advanced Miami Metro Operations), which employs a younger team of officers. Marcus knows they are getting too old for all the crazy things they used to get into, and he urges Mike to settle down, though he disagrees. The two go outside to have a foot race, and as Mike takes the lead, Armando rides up on a motorcycle and shoots Mike down. He gets away as the officers rush to help Mike.Mike is in critical condition. Marcus prays to God that Mike be saved, with the promise that Marcus will never bring anymore violence into the world. Rita and Howard then order AMMO - Kelly (Vanessa Hudgens), Dorn (Alexander Ludwig), and Rafe (Charles Melton) - to do what they can do investigate Mike's shooter. Meanwhile, Isabel chastises Armando for going after Mike so soon, as she deliberately wants him to die last so that he suffers watching others die. They proceed to go after a judge, a forensics analyst, and a prosecutor, killing them all in broad daylight.Six months later, Megan and Reggie get married, and Mike has recovered from his injuries. He delivers a speech at the wedding before later asking Marcus to help him catch the shooter, but Marcus refuses, fearing someone else will get hurt, and he insists that he is retired. After learning Mike is awake, Armando uploads his bodycam footage of him shooting Mike. He goes to Rita for help but is also met with the same refusal.Mike takes it upon himself to find his shooter. He visits a retired criminal named Manny The Butcher (DJ Khaled) and beats his hand with a hammer until he gives up the name of a guy named Booker Grassie (Rory Markham), who would have info on the owner of the motorcycle, and therefore the shooter. Mike goes to Captain Howard, who begrudgingly has him go along with AMMO to find Grassie. Mike quickly butts heads with Rafe since he's a smart-ass, but Kelly and Dorn respect Mike's status as a detective.Mike and the team go to a warehouse where Grassie is going to make a drop. Mike quickly catches that Grassie is trying to rip the guys off and will get himself killed. A shootout begins, and Mike tries to get Grassie out of there, but after fighting off the other thugs, Grassie is blown back by an explosion and is impaled by a forklift. He dies before Mike can get any info out of him.Marcus gets a call from a snitch named Carver Remy (Ivo Nandi), who claims that Armando is following him and trying to kill him. He asks Marcus for help, who then tries to contact Mike, but he ignores Marcus since he sees him as a quitter. Eventually, Mike picks up and joins Marcus in going to find Remy, but once they get to his hotel, Remy's body hits Marcus's (actually Theresa's) car. Mike runs into the hotel and fights Armando, managing to pull his mask off but finding himself stunned when he sees Armando's face. He manages to get away.Mike later joins Howard at a game, where the two bond as Howard expresses his genuine concern and care for Mike. As they are leaving, a bullet strikes Howard in the throat. Armando and Zway-Lo are behind it, but since Mike knows he is in plain sight, he pulls Howard away and stays behind a car, giving Armando no clear shot. Mike tries to revive Howard, but he dies. After his funeral, Marcus officially decides to join Mike in catching the shooter.Mike and Marcus go off to find a shady broker named Picante Jenkins (Happy Anderson) for a lead on their shooter. They enter Jenkins' motel room where he is coked out of his mind. Marcus tries to appeal to him on a personal level, but it only gets him punched hard. AMMO soon comes in, with Marcus having called them, and they tase Jenkins to the ground. After getting Jenkins' files, they recognize Zway-Lo and plan to track him next.The team goes to a club where they find Zway-Lo. After attempting to arrest him, he runs for it, and the team must fight his goons. Mike and Marcus hop on a motorcycle and sidecar, with Marcus having to break his promise to God and use a machine gun to fight off the incoming thugs. They ride into the streets to pursue Zway-Lo, who then attempts to board a chopper ladder. Mike runs off and latches onto the ladder as well. Armando shoots Zway-Lo off to get a better shot at Mike. He tells him ""Hasta el fuego"" before Mike lets go and falls into the water.Back at headquarters, Mike has Dorn look up files based on the phrase Armando said. Mike realizes Isabel is behind all of this. He explains to Marcus that before they teamed up, he was deep undercover in the Aretas cartel and he had a relationship with Isabel before he had to throw her in jail and get her husband killed. ""Hasta el fuego"" was a phrase they came up with that was nonsensical but was supposed to mean ""Together until the flame burns out."" She was also heavily into witchery, which gave her the nickname ""La Bruja"". Mike concludes that Armando is his son and that she has been grooming him for revenge, since all the victims were on the same case against the Aretas family. After realizing he knows the truth, Isabel contacts Mike and arranges for him to meet her in Mexico City to end things.The team heads to Mexico for the final showdown, with Isabel ordering Mike to meet them in an old palace. They engage in a firefight against Isabel's mercenaries, with the AMMO officers proving their skills with guns, as well as physically in Dorn's case. Marcus then shoots down a sniper chopper, causing it to come crashing down to the building and starting a fire. Armando goes to fight Mike, but he decides to confront him as a person and reveal his parentage to Armando. He asks Isabel if it's true, and she admits that it is. She tries to shoot Mike, but Armando steps in the way and takes the bullet in the shoulder. Rita then shoots Isabel off the ledge to her death... sending her plummeting into the flaming wreckage. Marcus almost falls over too, but Armando helps Mike pull him up and get them out of there.Later on, the team is getting along better and they celebrate as Rita has been promoted to become the new captain. Mike and Marcus then bond with Baby Marcus, singing the ""Bad Boys"" song to him.Before the credits roll, Mike visits Armando in prison, offering him a chance to make up for his crimes. Armando appears to be interested."
A Quiet Place Part II,2020,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8332922/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Following the events at home, the Abbott family now face the terrors of the outside world. Forced to venture into the unknown, they realize the creatures that hunt by sound are not the only threats lurking beyond the sand path. With the newly acquired knowledge of the seemingly invulnerable creatures' weakness, grief-stricken Evelyn Abbott finds herself on her own, with two young teens, a defenseless newborn son, and with no place to hide. Now, 474 days after the all-out alien attack inA Quiet Place (2018), the Abbotts summon up every last ounce of courage to leave their now-burned-to-the-ground farm and embark on a peril-laden quest to find civilization. With this in mind, determined to expand beyond the boundaries, the resilient survivors have no other choice but to venture into eerily quiet, uncharted hostile territory, hoping for a miracle. But, this time, the enemy is everywhere.—Nick Riganas Day 1Lee Abbott (John Krasanski) drives into a town and goes to a store to buy oranges. In the store we see rocket space toys. The shop keeper is watching the news, where an extraordinary bomb in China is being reported. Lee then walks through the street to a park where his wife, Evelyn (Emily Blunt), is pushing youngest son Beau on a swing. The Abbott family are there to watch a baseball game in which eldest son Marcus is playing. Lee sits next to Regan (his eldest child, and only daughter, who is deaf) on the stalls and says hi to his friend Emmett (Cillian Murphy), who is sat behind them with his youngest son. Emmett's eldest son bats the ball and makes a home run. As he runs to the final base the crowd and Emmett are shouting 'dive!' as the fielders are close. After this Emmett asks Regan how to say 'Dive' and she signals a diving motion with her hands in American Sign Language. Beau and Evelyn wish Marcus good luck as he goes up to bat. Marcus misses the first two balls, then is distracted by a large meteor in the sky. The game stops and everyone starts heading back to their cars / homes. Regan goes with her dad and Evelyn takes the boys. The aliens are already here though and start attacking the street and killing lots of people.Day 474The film cuts to moments after the events of A Quiet Place 1, the Abbott family leaves their home barefoot. (By this point, day 472-473, Evelyn has given birth to a baby boy, Lee was killed protecting Marcus and Regan from an alien, the house is both on fire and flooding and Evelyn has just killed several aliens with the help of Regan's cochlea implant feedback noise amplified by a speaker which weakens the aliens. Beau died on day 89 due to taking a space rocket toy from the store at the beginning of a Quiet Place 1, the sound of the toy attracted an alien who quickly attacked).Just before leaving the farm, Evelyn tells Marcus and Regan to 'stay there' whist she quietly heads back into the flooded cellar and tries to stay quiet as she swims in search of an oxygen tank. Meanwhile Regan tells Marcus she's going back to the house, and leaves Marcus with the baby. Regan collects the amplifier and microphone. She uses her clipper to cut a cord off the amplifier. Regan and Evelyn individually return and the family walk along the sandy path Lee had created until they reach the furthest point, and then they quietly step onto the dry leaves and continue their trek. Evelyn and Regan carry the baby in a trunk sound proofed with blankets and the oxygen tank is feeding a baby respiratory mask so that the trunk lid can be closed.The family reach a wire fence with an opening. As Evelyn walks through, her bag gets caught and a small sound is made, she looks behind her concerned about the noise and unknowingly triggers a trip wire that causes a bundle of bottles to fall and jangle. Evelyn whispers to Marcus and Regan ""RUN"". Meanwhile we cut perspective to a the view point through a gun aim that has been fixed on the family. An alien starts chasing the family.Whilst running, Marcus gets injured by a bear trap, which he handles silently until he sees his injured foot and lets out a primal scream. Evelyn tries to stop him screaming whilst Regan uses the amp, microphone and cochlear implant hearing aid to to create feedback that is unbearable to the alien. Evelyn shoots the alien in the head as it struggles against the sound.The family head inside a nearby derelict building. As they walk round a corner a man grabs Evelyn, puts his hand over Evelyn's mouth and signals shh while pointing to an alien on the ceiling. The man leads the family to a sound proof vault underground. A towel over the latch of the vault reduces noise and prevents the latch locking the door from the inside. He starts a timer on a stop watch and after a few minutes opens the door to let in air.Once safe, he tells the family they can't stay - there isn't enough food or water. Evelyn thinks she recognizes the man and says, 'Emmett?' - to which Emmett unmasks his face from the scarf and baseball cap he'd been wearing. He reiterates they can't stay. Evelyn asks about Emmett's children and he explains his sons died on Day 1.Evelyn asks after Lola, his wife. He explains Lola died 11 weeks ago, that she got sick and they moved down to the sound proof basement of this derelict warehouse once the pain was too bad and she was screaming. Emmett says 'I couldn't do enough'.Evelyn asks if Emmett would see the fires lit by Lee each night and if 'he knew it was him [Lee]?'. Emmett says he did. Evelyn asks why didn't he didn't come for them, since they were friends. (In A Quiet Place 1 the Abbot family had not had any contact from anyone and heard no radio signals despite searching and searching, very few survivors were left on Earth). Emmett explains that the people left, 'you don't know, do you? ...they're not people worth saving'. Regan signs and whispers 'you're nothing like him [Lee]!' to Emmett.Regan goes to her brother who is lying down to rest having had his ankle painfully dressed (in the vault to mute his screams). Regan gives Marcus headphones and plays radio white noise to him, scrolling through the frequencies. Suddenly Marcus hears music and sits bolt upright. Regan stops turning the dial and Evelyn rushes over. Marcus whispers 'music!' and Evelyn listens. Shocked she turns to Emmet who explains yes it's just the song 'Across The Sea' on a loop, that's all it ever does. Regan signs that he is a liar telling her mum that 'Dad would have heard it, he would have told us'. Emmett explains that you can't hear that signal down in the valley (where the Abbotts lived) - he and Lola only discovered it when they moved up here.Regan works out the signal originates from an island nearby, about 1 day's walk away. In the middle of the night she wakes Marcus and they go to the sound proof vault to talk. Regan attempts to convince Marcus to help her find a way to the radio tower, by following railway tracks to the coast then finding a boat. She wants to get to the station so that she can use the station to transmit the high frequency noise her hearing aid produces, that exposes weak spots on the aliens. In this way anyone (including the family) can use a radio to play the high pitch noise and protect themselves from the aliens - a significant step towards a better way of life. Marcus is very worried and does not want Regan to go. Regan insists she has to try because that's what Dad would have done. Regan is forced to venture out on her own very early in the morning after Marcus threatens to tell Mum (Evelyn). She leaves a note on the radio saying 'keep listening'.In the morning, after discovering that Regan has gone, Evelyn pleas Emmett to go after her and bring her back. He eventually agrees when Evelyn says that she wishes Lee was here to look him in the eye and tell him Regan is exactly the type of person worth saving.Meanwhile Regan comes across a train station with a derailed train and climbs aboard the front carriage, which is the only one still on the train track. There are several dead bodies, skeletons. She needs a first aid kit and finds one in the driver booth but struggles to open the door. She eventually reaches the box and takes it but the skeleton of the dead driver falls on her causing a fright and she screams. An alien shortly arrives and Regan is trapped struggling to hold the hearing aid to the microphone in one hand and operate the shotgun in the other. Luckily Emmett arrives and shoots the creature.They hide in near by station office due to fear the noise will have attracted more aliens. Emmett explains he is here to take her home. Regan is not happy and says 'what ""home""'. Regan explains her plan to Emmett, and says that before when his wife died there wasn't anything he could do but now there is. Emmett decides to help her complete the mission.Back at Emmett's base, Evelyn has to leave Marcus and the baby to get supplies they require - medicine for Marcus' foot and more oxygen tanks for the baby for when the baby is in the trunk. Marcus is very scared and doesn't want her to go. Evelyn explains his foot will get worse and she can't lose him too. Marcus understands and let's her go.She walks back to the sand path and follows the route she and the family uses to get to the store (where Lee bought oranges on Day 1). Along the way she passes the bridge where Beau died where a make-shift shrine is. She touched the photographs crying, and places her wedding ring on top of the cross.Back at base, after getting the baby to sleep, Marcus exits the bunker and explores the compound. The camera cuts to the baby's oxygen tank the gauge for which is in the red zone, since its is running low. Heading upstairs, Marcus finds a room covered in drawings of Emmett's sons. Behind some curtains separating a section of the room he finds a dead body half composed (probably Lola) lying in a bed. This startles him and he accidentally knocks a few objects over, alerting a nearby alien to his location.He runs back to the basement, grabs the baby and puts him in the vault, he then steps out again to grab the stopwatch and radio and, as the alien approaches, he is able to get into the vault and close the door. The towel is not over the latch and the door locks shut unbeknownst to Marcus.By nightfall Emmett and Regan reach some docks and look for a boat they can take to reach the island. They find a little girl at the end of the pontoon. Emmett goes up to her and she suddenly traps him in a noose. Several feral people appear who tie netting with bottles around Emmett and begin to search Regan for supplies. They take her hearing aid and rucksack full of supplies, then begin to lead her away. Emmett signs 'dive' to Regan, then he wriggles opens the netting making lots of noise and grabs the man who took Regan's hearing aid. Several aliens appear and attack the docks, killing a number of feral people. Emmett is still holding the man and an alien comes to attack due to the noise of the bottles. Emmett dives into the water and the feral man is killed by the alien. The alien then hears Emmett swimming in the water, and jumps after him, only to drown as it cannot swim. Emmett is still tied to the dock and struggles to remove the noose from his neck. A small boat comes by and Regan's hand reaches out to him. He climbs aboard and opens his mouth to reveal Regan's hearing aid. They remove the noose and we see their boat heading to the island. In the corner of the screen an alien is stranded on top of a boat that has detached from the docks during the chaos.Marcus is struggling to breathe and sees from the watch that he needs to open the door. He struggles with the door and eventually, distraught, gives up. He opens the baby's trunk to find the baby screaming. With a pained expression he starts sharing the oxygen with the baby, until he falls asleep.Meanwhile Evelyn returns to compound with the supplies and here's an alien making a loud cry. She tries to explode the alien by shooting an oxygen tank but the alien is unscathed. The explosion does, however, trigger the fire sprinklers. The noise of the sprinklers helps Evelyn navigate around the alien and return to the basement. The alien does chase her though. Evelyn hides inside the bunker with Marcus and the infant, with the alien waiting outside the door for them.Regan and Emmett approach the island, where they find a colony of people living normal lives after isolating themselves to the island. After the government realized the creatures could not swim, the National Guard had as many people as possible put on the islands. However, one of the creatures manages to get to the island on another boat and kills several civilians. However, they lure the creature away to where the radio station is, and it follows them inside. The alien eventually hears Regan and Emmett, slicing Emmett with its claws. However, as it goes after Regan, she is able to change the sound coming from the station from the song to the noise her hearing aid produced weakening the creature, as she eventually kills it with a pole. Marcus, picking up the signal through the radio, also uses the noise to weaken the creature, shooting it dead, now allowing anyone to be able to kill the creatures."
Sonic the Hedgehog,2020,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3794354/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"After discovering a small, blue, fast hedgehog, a small-town police officer must help him defeat an evil genius who wants to do experiments on him. Based on the global blockbuster videogame franchise from Sega, SONIC THE HEDGEHOG tells the story of the world's speediest hedgehog as he embraces his new home on Earth. In this live-action adventure comedy, Sonic and his new best friend Tom (James Marsden) team up to defend the planet from the evil genius Dr. Robotnik (Jim Carrey) and his plans for world domination. The family-friendly film also stars Tika Sumpter and Ben Schwartz as the voice of Sonic.—Paramount Pictures Sonic the Hedgehog lives on the planet Mobius and has incredible powers: he can run at supersonic speeds, turn into a ball with the strength of a missile, and generate powerful bolts of electricity. Fearing his powers put him at risk, Sonic's guardian, a wise owl named Longclaw, helps him escape to the planet Earth, advising him to stay hidden. Sonic later arrives in the small town of Green Hills, Montana. One night, he accidentally releases a power surge that causes a massive blackout. Baffled by this, the U.S. government hires the nefariously insane but ingenious scientist Dr. Ivo Robotnik to find out what caused the blackout. They soon discover Sonic and his incredible superpowers. Robotnik wants to capture Sonic in hopes of using his powers to improve his army of evil drones and robots. Sonic turns to local police officer Tom Wachowski for help hiding from Robotnik and the U.S. military. Now, Sonic and Tom are on an action-packed road trip to find the rings that would allow Sonic to leave Earth and ruin Dr. Robotnik's evil plan. Based on SEGA's iconic gaming franchise, Sonic The Hedgehog takes the fastest thing alive from Planet Mobius and takes him to the suburbs of Green Hills, where the eccentric Dr. Robotnik will pursue this 'alien menace' at the behest of The American Government.—Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187 In San Francisco, California, a seemingly normal day is interrupted by a shocking spectacle: an anthropomorphic hedgehog with blue fur, white gloves and red shoes is running through the city at breathtaking speed while a flying machine piloted by a mustached scientist dressed in red gives chase and fires explosive energy blasts!In the middle of the chase, there is a pause as the hedgehog, named Sonic, begins to narrate what is currently happening and rewinds to the very beginning.Sonic recalls his childhood days living on a beautiful island with palm trees, waterfalls, and even loop-de-loops made of earth. He recalls running joyously across the island every day, relishing in life and making full, open use of his natural-born powers despite being told to keep them secret.The toddler Sonic rushes home to the treehouse where his doting surrogate mother, Longclaw the Owl is resting, and playfully bumps into her to wake her up. Longclaw warns Sonic that he might have been noticed because of his coveted powers, and sure enough, as Sonic affectionately presents a sunflower to her, they are ambushed by a tribe of echidna archers. Longclaw desperately flies away with Sonic, only for one of the echidnas to fire his arrow and successfully strike her, causing her to plummet to the ground with Sonic still clinging to her. Though injured, Longclaw reminds Sonic of the importance of keeping himself and his powers hidden, and uses a golden ring to open a portal to a world on the far side of the universe, called Earth. She gives the rest of the rings to Sonic in a small bag and tells him to flee to Earth, where he will be safe. The reluctant Sonic runs through the portal while Longclaw stays behind to hold off the approaching echidnas. Seeing her in danger, Sonic desperately runs back to try to save her, but the portal closes just before he can reach her, leaving Sonic heartbroken and alone.Ten years later, Sonic has adjusted to life on Earth. Tom Wachowski, the local sheriff of Green Hills, Montana, is sitting bored in the empty speed trap, waiting for cars, and Sonic playfully messes with him by zipping past his radar gun at ridiculous speeds. Tom discovers one of Sonic's blue quills lying in the long grass and brings it with him as he is called away by his deputy, Wade to address a minor issue. Sonic saves a turtle from being run over by an approaching car and takes the excited reptile for a wild ride before leaving it and zipping back to his hidden cave of a makeshift home. Sonic seems to love his life, since he has great fun with the discarded items he uses to occupy himself, and feels safe since he knows what to do if he is ever discovered. Should he ever be found, he'll escape to one of the worlds depicted on a map included in the bag of rings; an uninhabited world full of giant mushrooms. He hates the idea, but he is not worried, since Green Hills feels like a home to him. He frequents the town every day and secretly observes the people, his favorite of whom is Tom (or ""Donut Lord,"" as he calls him). He also likes Tom's veterinarian wife Maddie, whom he nicknames ""Pretzel Lady"" for her yoga flexibility. He also likes to mess with old, eccentric Crazy Carl, the only person in town who actually knows about him and who is constantly trying in vain to catch him. Having formed a strong bond with Tom and Maddie from afar, Sonic often hangs out around their house, especially on movie nights. But even with this fun place and all of these so-called ""friends"" of his, Sonic still feels very lonely in his self-imposed isolation.After coming home one night to find raccoons in his trash can, Tom receives from Maddie his long-awaited letter of acceptance into the San Francisco Police Department, and the two discuss the difficult decision to move away from Green Hills. The next day, as Tom recites his departure speech to a donut, Sonic observes the local youth baseball playoffs. That night, Sonic goes into the vacant baseball field and plays by himself, using his speed to assume the roles of all the players. He manages to make a perfect play and rejoices, but when he looks around and sees that no one is there to cheer him on, he realizes he is truly alone forever. In his despair, he tries to work off the pain by running desperately around the field, until the energy emitting from his body generates a massive electromagnetic pulse that knocks out power across the entire Pacific Northwest. With the entire town in the dark, the panicking Wade contacts Tom, who gives him instructions but ends the call prematurely when he sees the quill he discovered earlier glowing with electric, blue light.News of the event soon reaches the Pentagon, and the baffled Department of Defense enlists the help of brilliant roboticist and scientific genius, Dr. Robotnik to discover the cause. After Robotnik and his partner, Agent Stone take charge of the military detachment stationed at the baseball field, Robotnik's flying, high-tech, egg-shaped drones head into the forest and discover one of Sonic's footprints. Robotnik discovers that his computer can't find a single match in Earth's animal kingdom to identify the creature responsible for the print. As the military troops and the drones search the forest for Sonic, Sonic rushes back to his cave to collect his valuables and prepares to leave Earth forever. But just before he can use the rings, the troops and drones draw close to his cave and Sonic flees to avoid them, sentimentally bidding goodbye to his cave.Meanwhile, Tom is on the phone with Maddie, who has flown out to San Francisco to visit her sister, Rachel and niece, Jojo. As Tom tells Maddie about the blackout, he hears a disturbance and sees his trash can toppled over. Thinking the raccoons are back, Tom takes Maddie's tranquilizer gun and goes out to investigate the shed. Inside the shed, Sonic prepares to use his ring, but just before he can, Tom bursts into the shed and sees him. Both of them scream in terror at the sight of each other, and Tom fires a dart into Sonic's leg. The weakening Sonic sees a picture of San Francisco's Transamerica Pyramid on Tom's T-shirt, and as he drops his ring, it opens a portal above the actual building itself. Sonic accidentally drops the bag of rings into the portal, and it lands on the building's roof. The portal thusly closes as Sonic passes out, and Tom brings Sonic inside, placing him in a dog cage.Tom examines Sonic and realizes he is Crazy Carl's ""Blue Devil."" Sonic awakens and climbs out of the cage, and the two finally meet for real just as Robotnik's truck arrives. Sonic begs for Tom's help and Tom hides Sonic in the attic as he goes out to meet Robotnik, who dispatches his drones to search the house while the two talk outside. Sonic hides from the drones and curls up into a ball to hide among the various sports balls stored in the attic, but when the drones get too close, Sonic flees the attic and causes a noise. Robotnik barges into the house to find only a raccoon eating a cake that Maddie baked for Tom. As he turns to leave, however, he discovers the quill. As Robotnik threatens Tom to reveal where Sonic is, Sonic shows himself and begs Robotnik to spare Tom, eliciting a terrified scream from Robotnik. Seizing the opportunity, Tom punches Robotnik and knocks him out cold, and after a battle in the house with one of Robotnik's drones, Tom and Sonic escape the house. Agent Stone arrives to check on Robotnik, who berates Stone for not trying to stop the fugitives and tells him to bring the quill.With Tom and Sonic now on the run, Tom asks Sonic to explain himself, and Sonic says that he needs to get to San Francisco so he can get back his lost rings. At first, Tom tells Sonic to go himself, but Sonic doesn't know where San Francisco is, and following Tom's directions to simply head west only causes him to crash straight into the Pacific and run back to Tom wet, cold, covered in seaweed, and wearing a fish. Sonic blames Tom for his fate and insists he can't accomplish his goal alone. Reluctantly, Tom agrees to take Sonic with him to San Francisco.As the two begin their travels, Sonic treats the journey as a fun road trip, admiring the attractions along the way, such as the world's largest rubber band ball. That night, they stop in a certain section of town and Tom tells Sonic to stay in the car as he uses a nearby payphone to call Wade, who reveals that Robotnik and his agents are searching for Tom, and are with him in the station. Furious at having been punched in the face, Robotnik warns Tom that he is coming for him. Meanwhile, Sonic tries desperately to control his excitement over an extremely entertaining-looking biker bar, but eventually caves in. Tom comes back to his car with a purchased meal, only to find Sonic missing. He finds Sonic in the bar and Sonic persuades him to stay and have fun with him. Sonic compiles a ""bucket list"" of the things he'd like to do on Earth, but becomes sad when he realizes he might not be able to do them since he has to leave Earth soon. But Tom encourages Sonic to try to do as much as he can right where they are, and the two take a while to enjoy themselves with all the bar's activities. Unfortunately, a group of rough-looking punks come looking for trouble and Sonic aggravates their leader, starting a bar fight. The leader of the punks attacks Sonic, but Sonic speeds up his awareness and runs around the bar, saving Tom from attackers and setting up sassy pranks and traps to end the fight, all in the span of the single moment before the punk leader can reach him. The fight is ended abruptly by Sonic's devices and the punk leader crashes through the window wearing a wall-mounted bear head. Tom and Sonic flee the bar, outrunning the angry patrons, and spend the night in a local motel.After Sonic runs around the room enjoying himself with various activities, Tom asks him about this other planet to which he must go when he leaves Earth. Sonic reveals that it's a very unenviable place and wonders aloud about whether Longclaw might have been wrong. He ponders having a life on Earth and soon falls asleep. As Tom tucks him in, he sees that one of the items on Sonic's bucket list is to ""make a real friend."" At that moment, the news report features a warning about Tom, who has been declared a domestic terrorist because of his actions in protecting Sonic from Robotnik and the military.The next morning, Robotnik and Stone interrogate the bar patrons, including the punk leader, learning that Tom and Sonic are heading to San Francisco. Robotnik triangulates their location and gives chase. On the road, Sonic asks Tom about what he would have on his own bucket list. Tom reveals his intentions to leave Green Hills to become a San Francisco street cop and prove himself as a hero, but Sonic is baffled by the fact that Tom would want to leave such a perfect town and all the people he cares about. Robotnik finds them and sends out a battle machine called Mayhem. A battle on the road ensues, with Tom and Sonic defeating each of the machine's smaller phases, though the car is badly damaged in the fight. Eventually, Sonic finds himself with a bomb stuck to his hand, and they pull off the road to get rid of it. But just when Sonic manages to get it off, it explodes, knocking Sonic out cold.Tom is relieved to find that Sonic is alive, but Robotnik is enraged, and berates Stone for sympathizing with them. At that moment, however, Robotnik finds that the quill in Stone's pocket is glowing with blue, electric light.Finally reaching San Francisco, Tom rushes to Maddie's house, only to be greeted by a fiercely antagonistic Rachel, who has seen the news reports on him and refuses to let him in until Maddie intervenes. Jojo and Tom's dog, Ozzy come to greet him, and as Rachel and Maddie argue about Tom, Ozzy pulls away the towel in which Tom has wrapped Sonic, revealing him. Rachel faints at the sight and Maddie and Jojo just stare.Robotnik, meanwhile, analyzes the quill and the energy it contains whilst amusing himself by dancing to a tune, until he is startled half to death by the sudden appearance of Agent Stone, who has come to offer a latte. At that moment, the machine finishes analyzing the quill, revealing it to contain unlimited energy, which Robotnik believes can enable his machines to reach their full potential.Tom and Maddie tend to the injured Sonic, while Rachel sits bound in a chair. Maddie uses smelling salts to awaken Sonic, who zips around the room at breathtaking speed before frantically coming to grips with his surroundings and enthusiastically greeting Pretzel Lady. The terrified Maddie asks Tom who and what Sonic is, and Tom reveals the truth of their adventures together and Sonic's intent to reach the Transamerica Pyramid. Jojo brings Sonic a new pair of bright, red shoes, to which he takes an instant liking. Sonic also meets Ozzy, of whom he is jealous, but from whom he enjoys an affectionate face-licking.Tom and Maddie borrow the indignant Rachel's car and head with Sonic to the Transamerica Pyramid, where Tom uses the false pretense of saving a jumper to gain the needed clearance to travel to the roof. Tom and Maddie carry Sonic inside a bag, eliciting grave concern from onlookers who believe that the pair are carrying an abducted child. The three finally reach the roof, where Sonic at last finds and retrieves his bag of rings. After an emotional goodbye between Sonic and Tom, Sonic attempts to throw a ring to open the portal, but it bounces off of one of Robotnik's drones. Many more drones surround the three and Robotnik himself appears in his own flying craft to meet them. After a brief exchange between Robotnik and Tom, Sonic taunts Robotnik by calling him ""Eggman"" after his egg-shaped drones. Robotnik readies his drones to blow the three away, but Sonic pushes Tom and Maddie off the top of the building. Robotnik fires his missiles at Sonic, who speeds up his awareness to avoid them and casually pushes them aside. But Robotnik is able to press a button that charges his vehicle with energy from the quill, and achieves supersonic speed. He fires a blast which Sonic only narrowly avoids, and which knocks him into momentary delirium. Sonic awakes to find Tom and Maddie still falling. He grabs one of the rings falling with him and throws it, opening a portal beneath them that transports the two back to Green Hills. Tom and Maddie end up in a farmer's barn, while back in San Francisco, Sonic lands in a tree before crashing to the ground, along with the rest of the rings and Robotnik's destroyed drones. Meanwhile, the owner of the barn greets Tom and Maddie, asking for their help in aiding a cow's effort to give birth.Robotnik corners Sonic and taunts him, but Sonic gathers up his spilled rings and runs through the city as Robotnik gives chase in his vehicle. Narrating again, Sonic notes how this has brought the film full circle, and earnestly continues the story, wanting to know what happens next just as much as the audience. Robotnik chases Sonic through San Francisco, and Sonic is shocked by Robotnik's ability to keep up with him. Sonic opens a portal to France, with him and Robotnik disrupting a mime act being performed for a young girl as they rush past. Sonic's next ring portal brings him and Robotnik to China, where Robotnik chases Sonic along the Great Wall. Next, Sonic opens a portal to Egypt, where Robotnik destroys many centuries-old monuments in his zeal to catch Sonic. Sonic uses his speed to create a sand whirlwind that temporarily disrupts Robotnik's visual contact, but Robotnik sees Sonic running up the side of one of the Great Pyramids and follows him to the top, firing a blast just as Sonic manages to open another portal ring.The portal brings Sonic back to Green Hills, now at night, but the blast sends him hurtling through the ring and into the street, where he lays motionless. Robotnik's vehicle emerges through the portal and the terrified onlookers flee. Robotnik prepares to kill Sonic, but Tom engages him in physical combat inside the open cockpit of his vehicle. Unfortunately, Tom is knocked out of the cockpit and Robotnik questions why Tom would be willing to throw his life away for a ""silly little alien."" The locals come to defend Tom, but Sonic remains motionless and silent. Robotnik suggests putting the body on ice to keep it fresh and remarks that Sonic was just an alien who didn't belong. Tom responds by telling Robotnik that Sonic knew more about being human than he ever will, proclaiming him to have been his friend, which wakes Sonic up from his wounded daze. Fueled by passion, Sonic charges up with incredible energy and boldly proclaims to Robotnik that he will no longer run away, but use the power which is rightfully his to protect his friends. Robotnik pulls down his goggles and the two opponents prepare to meet in full-on battle. Robotnik fires his missiles, but Sonic avoids them and bounces off the buildings to strike Robotnik's vehicle with an increasingly rapid barrage of body-slams. With the vehicle severely damaged, but still afloat, Sonic calls for Tom to open a portal to the mushroom planet behind Robotnik. Then, at last, Sonic dashes straight at Robotnik's vehicle and strikes it with enough force to send it flying backwards through the portal to the mushroom planet just as the portal closes.Tom and Sonic reunite and Tom gives Sonic back his rings, as well as a high-five: a gift desired by Sonic ever since his having seen a young baseball batter high-five his teammates. Tom tells Maddie that he has decided not to leave Green Hills, feeling that he has already saved a life. As the crowd disperses, Sonic follows Tom and Maddie.The next day, as Tom and Maddie are repairing and repainting their house, one of the officials from the Pentagon comes to thank Tom for defeating Robotnik, and to inform him that his guilt has been erased, along with all records of Robotnik's existence. As a bonus, he presents Tom with an Olive Garden gift card and asks if Sonic might be willing to talk to the President, but Tom falsely claims that Sonic has left so as to spare him that. After the official leaves, Sonic asks if they'd like to see a movie, but Maddie tells him that it's time to go back to his cave. However, when Sonic tries to go, they tell him that they meant something else. Opening the attic door, Tom and Maddie show Sonic his new room, which he is astonished to find contains all of his belongings. Overcome with joy, Sonic runs around and relishes in having his things back. Tom and Maddie sit with Sonic on the bed and welcome him home, and Sonic gives them heartfelt thanks. As the view zooms out and away from the house, Ozzy comes to lick Sonic again, with Sonic still jealous but enjoying the licking.Meanwhile, on the mushroom planet, Robotnik has completely lost his sanity. As he finishes shaving himself totally bald, he gazes at his reflection in a pool of water, now with an extremely long, grown-out mustache that looks completely zany. Talking to a rock that he has carved to resemble Agent Stone, he throws it and tells it to perform ""rock-connaissance"" for him. He reflects on his situation and remarks that a lesser man would die in such a place. But then, he holds up a small container with the quill inside it, and says that he'll be home by Christmas. Pulling down his goggles, he walks like a robot until he finds the stone, which he throws again as he yells out ""rock-connaissance"" once more and laughs maniacally.A mid-credits scene shows forested hills, and on one hill, the leaves stir as a ring portal opens. From it emerges a young, orange fox with two tails, who uses a small handheld device to determine from the present levels of energy whether Sonic might be near. Finding the readings to be sufficient, the young fox hopes aloud that he is not too late to find him and uses his twin tails like helicopter blades to take off flying into the vast forest."
Birds of Prey,2020,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7713068/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"After splitting with the Joker, Harley Quinn joins superheroines Black Canary, Huntress, and Renee Montoya to save a young girl from an evil crime lord. A twisted tale told by Harley Quinn herself: When Gotham's most nefariously narcissistic villain Roman Sionis, and his zealous right-hand, Zsasz, put a target on a young girl named Cass, the city is turned upside-down looking for her. Harley, Huntress, Black Canary, and Renee Montoya's paths collide, and the unlikely foursome has no choice but to team up to take down Roman. After her painful breakup with Joker, shortly after the battle with the Enchantress inSuicide Squad (2016), the already unhinged and extremely volatile Harley Quinn finds herself all alone. But with her mentor out of the picture and a huge target on her back, Harley locks horns with Gotham City's ruthless crime lord Roman Sionis, who's trying to track down a precious diamond and the audacious pickpocket, Cassandra Cain. Now, on the hunt for the teen street hustler and the gemstone, Quinn crosses paths with singer Dinah Lance, Detective Renee Montoya, and a mysterious crossbow-wielding murderess who are all also after Cassandra, as Roman's top assassin, Victor Zsasz, is bent on getting her first. Can Harley take down the brutal super-villain known only as the Black Mask?—Nick Riganas In Gotham City, the Joker breaks up with Harley Quinn and without his protection, several criminals that have a beef with her hunt her down. When teenager Cassandra Cain pickpockets a diamond that has the account numbers of a fortune from the gangster Victor Zsasz, who is the right-hand of the powerful criminal Roman Sionis, he put a contract on her. Harley Quinn, Police Detective Renee Montoya, Helena ""The Huntress"" Bertinelli. and Dinah ""Black Canary"" Lance team up to protect Cassandra.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil The film starts with Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie) telling her story from the beginning through an animated intro. As a child, her deadbeat alcoholic dad tried to get rid of her multiple times until he finally dumped her at a Catholic girls school. Harley was always a troublemaker, but she got educated and earned a PhD, becoming a psychologist. That's where she met The Joker and fell in love, leading her to go from Harleen Quinzel to Harley Quinn. However, they have recently broken up since he helped her escape from prison (shown at the end of the previous film 'Suicide Squad'), and despite Harley saying she was fine, she does not take it well and ends up staying alone in a crummy apartment with a hyena she adopted and named Bruce (after Bruce Wayne).Harley goes to the Black Mask club where she gets plastered (drunk) and annoys a nearby thug who insults her. She ends up smashing his leg, and is told by the club's owner, Roman Sionis/Black Mask (Ewan McGregor), that that was his driver. He does nothing because Harley hasn't told anybody that she and Joker are broken up, since them being a couple gave her immunity from the wrath of Gotham's other thugs. Harley is out with other women whom she overhears saying that she's nothing without Joker and that she'll go running back to him soon enough. Harley decides to challenge this by driving a truck into Ace Chemicals where she and Joker used to stay, obliterating the plant into an explosion of fireworks.Moments before this, Detective Renee Montoya (Rosie Perez) is investigating what appears to be a mob hit at a restaurant. A flashback shows Helena Bertinelli/Huntress (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) killing the men inside with a crossbow, which has earned her the alias, ""The Crossbow Killer."" Montoya then hears the chemical plant explosion and goes to find Harley's J necklace, which is a clear sign to both cops and criminals that she and Joker are no more, meaning Harley has just declared open season on herself.Among the criminals that want Harley dead are Roman and his best friend/right hand man Victor Zsasz (Chris Messina), a psychopath who carves a tally on his body for every one of his victims. They are shown torturing the Keo family and cutting their faces off.Harley is getting her ""perfect egg sandwich"", but Montoya and a few other pissed off crooks find and go after her. Montoya tackles Harley and causes her to drop her sandwich into the street, which devastated Harley. When it seems like she's cornered, she throws a bag of garbage at Montoya, which blindsides one crook and causes him to shoot an incoming truck-driving crook, allowing Harley to get away. Unfortunately, she runs into a large thug that she and Joker face-tattooed, but before he can get her, he is killed by Helena on her motorcycle. Harley is then surrounded by Roman's thugs.Montoya returns to the police station where she is mocked by other officers. She meets with Captain Patrick Erickson (Steven Williams), who was her former partner that took credit for her hard work and got promoted, and District Attorney Ellen Yee (Ali Wong), who is also Montoya's ex. She is building a case against Roman but doesn't have much support from either of them. Montoya is then brought to Cassandra Cain (Ella Jay Basco), a young girl brought in for pick pocketing. Montoya then gets a call from Dinah Lance/Black Canary (Jurnee Smollett-Bell), saying that Cass has a diamond with her. Soon, Harley comes in and tries to go after Cass, but she realizes she is getting ahead of herself in the story.A week earlier at the club, Roman was telling Mr. Keo (Francois Chau) about the Bertinelli Diamond, which contains codes to their massive fortune and is now in Roman's possession. The diamond was also the reason Helena's whole family was slaughtered. Keo refused to work with Roman, which is what later leads to the demise of him and his family. Dinah works at the club as a singer, noted for her beautiful voice. She later talks to a drunken Harley, who admits to her that she and Joker broke up. Harley then drinks with another man who later tries to abduct her. Dinah sees this and beats up the man and his buddies. Roman observes this from his window and is impressed, and he has Zsasz bring Dinah up so he can hire her as his new driver. This leads Montoya to try and get info from Dinah on Roman, but she refuses to help.Dinah knows Cass because they live in the same building, and Dinah has a soft spot for Cass since she knows she lives with abusive foster parents. Later on, Cass picks Zsasz's pocket and steals the diamond, just before she is arrested for other stuff she stole.Just after Harley gets away from Montoya, Roman's guys capture her. She knows he had a long list of grievances against her (such as ""voting for Bernie, pronouncing it 'expresso', and calling him Romey""). Roman smacks Harley around, at which point she has a fantasy about herself as Marilyn Monroe in a ""Diamonds Are A Girl's Best Friend"" sequence. Before Roman can have Harley killed, he learns from Zsasz that the diamond is gone. Harley offers a chance to recover the diamond, which Roman agrees to. After she leaves, he orders a bounty on Cass.Cut to Harley attacking the police station with colored smoke and confetti bombs. She breaks Cass out but also lets loose other crooks who want to kill her. Harley fights them all on her own, with a little help from Cass, utilizing a baseball bat and lighter, among other things. More goons who want Cass and the diamond shows up, and after inhaling some coke, Harley kills them. She escapes the station with Cass in tow and takes her somewhere safe.Roman learns that Harley and Cass got away from his goons. He loses his shit and spots a woman, Erika (Bojana Novakovic), in his club laughing, and Zsasz convinces Roman that she is laughing at him. He orders Erika to dance on the table and to take off her dress, going as far as to order her friend to cut it off of her. This shows Dinah just how monstrous Roman is.Harley learns that Cass swallowed the diamond and goes to a supermarket to buy laxatives, warning her that anyone else will have no problem cutting it out of her. They rob their supplies and go back to Harley's apartment, which is above a Taiwanese restaurant run by Doc (Dana Lee), a kindly man who keeps Harley safe. After Harley and Cass go upstairs, Helena approaches Doc to ask for Harley. Harley then cuts to Helena's backstory: after her family was murdered by mob boss Stefano Galante (Roberto Catrini), one of Galante's goons saw that she survived but took her away to Sicily to stay with his brother and father. They trained Helena to become the killer that she is now. She killed Galante, and the mob guys from earlier were the firing squad that killed her family. Zsasz is the last name on her list.Back at the police station, Montoya finds out that Yee went behind her back and told Erickson that she stole evidence from a crime scene. Erickson suspends Montoya.Harley's apartment comes under attack by one of Roman's goons. The place gets blown up, and Bruce goes missing. Harley learns that Doc sold her out to Roman's goons because they paid him well. Harley then contacts Roman and offers to trade Cass in exchange for immunity. He agreed and has Dinah drive Zsasz to meet them, but Zsasz spots a text exchange between Dinah and Montoya to let her know where they are headed. He informs Roman, who becomes upset and puts on his Black Mask.Harley arranges to be met at an amusement park in a spot called the Booby Trap where she used to hide with Joker. Cass learns about the betrayal as Harley straps her to a toilet so she can pass the diamond. Montoya shows up first and fights Harley, nearly taking her in until Harley uncuffs herself and kicks Montoya out of the building. Dinah and Zsasz show up, but Zsasz hits Harley with a tranquilizer and prepares to kill her. Helena shows up and shoots Zsasz in the neck with an arrow, killing him. The ladies then confront each other until they see Roman show up outside with a whole army of thugs. Knowing that he has a bone to pick with all of them, Harley suggests they team up to fight them all. They reluctantly agree and grab a bunch of old weapons (mallet for Harley, bat for Dinah, brass knuckles for Montoya, etc) and head off to fight. They smash and bash their way through a bunch of goons before Roman manages to kidnap Cass. The ladies are cornered by armed goons until Dinah lets out a supersonic scream to take them down and allow Harley to go after Roman on roller blades.Harley chases Roman and gets knocked over by other goons. Helena rides by and gives Harley a pull, managing to kill those other goons before causing Roman's car to crash. He takes Cass to the pier and tries to taunt Harley, saying she needs him. She hits back that the criminals in Gotham should fear her, not him or Joker. Before Roman can hurt Cass, she reveals she planted a grenade on him and pulled the pin out. Harley throws Roman off the pier where he explodes into bloody chunks before hitting the water. The others join Harley and Cass, relieved that Roman is now gone.The next morning, the ladies gather for tacos and margaritas. Cass goes to pass the diamond, but she and Harley just steal Dinah's car and ride off.Later on, Erickson once again takes credit for Montoya's work in bringing down Roman and his empire. She quits the GCPD and joins Dinah and Helena to form the Birds of Prey using the money in the Bertinelli accounts.Harley and Cass pawn the diamond and ride away with Bruce (who turned up alive), with Harley taking Cass on as her apprentice. Harley says she may be a softie, but she dares anyone else to call her that.After the credits:Harley's voice can be heard getting ready to tell the audience a big secret about Batman... only for the audio to cut off."

The Call of the Wild,2020,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7504726/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A sled dog struggles for survival in the wilds of the Yukon. The Call of the Wild is a vibrant story of Buck, a big and kindhearted dog, a crossbreed between a St. Bernard and a Scotch shepherd whose carefree life of leisure was suddenly upset when he was stolen from his home in Santa Clara County, California and deported up north, to be sold in Skagway, Alaska, and taken further north, to Dawson City, Yukon, during the late 1890s Klondike Gold Rush, when strong sled dogs were in high demand. As a newcomer to the dog team delivery service - and not before long their front-runner - Buck, a dog like no other, who had been spoiled, and who had suffered, but he could not be broken, is having the time of his life. Forced to fight to survive, eventually taken by his last owner, John Thornton, to proximity of the Arctic Circle, somewhere between Yukon and Alaska, he progressively depends on his primal instincts, sheds the comforts of civilization and responds to ""the call of the wild"", as master of his own.—Davor Blazevic 1959 <davor.blazevic@yahoo.com> As the great Klondike Gold Rush is attracting both ambitious treasure hunters and bold adventurers to the unforgiving territories of Canada's late-1890s Yukon, Buck, a pampered St. Bernard-Scotch Collie dog, finds himself without a master in a frozen new world. But, there, in the corner of the Earth, the gentle canine ends up as the newest member of kindly mail carrier Perrault's seasoned team of sled dogs, and after a succession of owners, Buck crosses paths with the grizzled recluse, John Thornton. Now, the adventure of a lifetime commences, as man and beast alike embark on an exciting journey of redemption and freedom into Yukon's uncharted subarctic wilderness. Will Buck answer the call of the wild and finally find his place in the world?—Nick Riganas Jack London's classic story from 1903 about Buck, a dog kidnapped from his home in California and taken to the Yukon where he is mistreated until a prospector discovers him and relates to his situation. Although the two are bonded, Buck yearns to run free with the wild dogs in the wilderness.—andrewpdresden Buck is a big-hearted dog whose blissful domestic life gets turned upside down when he is suddenly uprooted from his California home and transplanted to the exotic wilds of the Alaskan Yukon in the 1890s. As the newest rookie on a mail-delivery dog sled team, Buck experiences the adventure of a lifetime as he ultimately finds his true place in the world.—yusufpiskin During the late 19th century Gold Rush, Buck, a large, gentle St. Bernard/Scotch Collie, lives contentedly with his master, Judge Miller (Bradley Whitford) in Santa Clara, California. One night, Buck is abducted (to be sold into slavery) and shipped to the Yukon (Alaska) aboard a freighter. During the voyage, a crew member ill-treats him (by beating and starving him). After arriving, Buck returns a dropped harmonica to a man named John Thornton (Harrison Ford), moments before being sold to Perrault (Omar Sy) and his assistant, Francoise (Cara Gee). They use a dog sled to deliver mail across the Yukon. Perrault hopes to make the long trek to the mail depot before the deadline. Buck is introduced to the other dogs, including the vicious pack leader, a Husky named Spitz.Throughout their travels, Buck gains the loyalty and trust of Francoise (by saving her life when she falls through an ice sheet) and the other sled dogs, antagonizing Spitz. Buck begins experiencing ancestral spiritual visions: a black wolf that acts as his guide throughout their travels. One night, Buck catches & then releases a rabbit. Spitz kills it, then attacks Buck to assert his dominance. Buck pins him down, displacing Spitz as pack leader, who disappears into the wild. Perrault grudgingly makes Buck the lead when no other dog assumes the position. Buck's speed and strength allow the sled to arrive to deposit the mail on time. There, Thornton hands over a letter he has written to his former wife expressing his feeling about their dead son. When Perrault returns, he learns the mail route is being replaced by the telegraph, forcing him to sell the dogs. Hal (Dan Stevens), a corrupt wealthy man, buys the pack, working them to exhaustion carrying a heavy load in weather unsuitable for sledding.The exhausted dogs stop to rest before Hal can force them to cross an unstable frozen lake. When Buck refuses to move, Hal threatens to shoot him. Thornton appears and rescues Buck while Hal forces the other sled dogs to cross the lake. Under Thornton's care, Buck recovers. Later, at a bar, Thornton is attacked by Hal, who reveals the dogs abandoned him. Witnessing the scene, Buck attacks Hal. Buck and Thornton then travel beyond the Yukon map where they can freely live in the wild. They come across an abandoned cabin in an open valley and settle in. Meanwhile, Hal relentlessly hunts them, believing Thornton is hiding gold.In the open wilderness, Thornton and Buck bond over their daily activities, primarily fishing and gold panning. Throughout their time together, Buck is drawn to a female white wolf. Going back and forth between Thornton and the white wolf, Buck is conflicted by his domesticated life with Thornton and his place with the wolf pack that the female belongs to. Thornton believes it is time to return home and tells Buck he is leaving in the morning, and to come and say good-bye. Buck heads into the forest and sleeps beside the white wolf, clearly conflicted. Hal subsequently finds and mortally shoots Thornton. Buck returns and kills Hal, pushing him into the cabin, which has caught on fire. Thornton, dying, wants Buck to live for himself. He embraces him and reassures him with his final words: ""It's okay, boy. You're home.""
The next morning, Buck returns to the wilderness. There, he mates and has offspring with the white wolf and becomes the pack leader, fully embracing the call of the wild."

Now, Ian and his older metalhead brother, Barley, can finally bring their dad back to life, and spend an entire day together; however, after a botched attempt to harness the power of the magical artefact, the Lightfoot brothers will have to embark on a peril-laden quest behind their mother's back. But, time is running out, and in a world that has forgotten how to use magic, this is easier said than done. Will Ian find his calling, and make his dream come true?—Nick Riganas In a world inhabited by mythic creatures, magic was commonplace several millennia ago, though difficult to master. After technological advances over the centuries, magic became obsolete and was largely discarded.In the modern day, two elf brothers, Ian and Barley Lightfoot, live in the city of New Mushroomton. Ian, the younger, is a high-school student struggling with self-confidence, and Barley, the older, is an enthusiastic and impulsive history and role-playing game fanatic. Their father Wilden died of a severe illness shortly before Ian was born, and their mother Laurel has a new boyfriend, centaur police officer Colt Bronco, whom Ian and Barley dislike.On Ian's sixteenth birthday, Laurel gives her sons a gift from Wilden: a magical staff, a rare Phoenix gem, and a letter describing a ""visitation spell"" that can resurrect their father for a single day. Ian accidentally succeeds in casting the spell, but only the lower half of Wilden's body is reformed before the gem disintegrates. The brothers embark on a quest to acquire another gem and complete the spell, taking Barley's beloved van ""Guinevere"". Finding the boys gone, Laurel leaves to look for them.Ian and Barley visit the Manticore's Tavern, named for a monster possessing a map to the gem. The tavern has become a family restaurant managed by the Manticore (""Corey"" for short). While arguing with Ian over the map, Corey realizes how boring her life has become and drives the customers away in a fit of insanity, accidentally setting fire to the restaurant and the map. The brothers' only clue to the gem is a children's menu suggesting ""Raven's Point"", a nearby mountain. Laurel later arrives at the scene and befriends Corey, who agrees to help her. Corey warns Laurel that the brothers' journey may awaken a curse that can only be defeated by her sword, which she and Laurel steal from a pawn shop.Traveling to the mountains, Ian and Barley narrowly escape the police and a motorcycle gang of pixies,[7] relying on Ian's newly awakened spell-casting abilities and Barley's RPG instincts. ""Raven's Point"" leads them on a trail indicated by a series of raven statues, but Colt follows them, calling in reinforcements. After coming to a dead end, Barley sacrifices Guinevere to cause a landslide, blocking their pursuers. Following the statues, the brothers descend through a cave and avoid a series of traps and deadly creatures, during which Barley reveals to Ian that he was unable to emotionally bring himself to say goodbye to Wilden when he was dying in the hospital. The final obstacle sends them back to the surface, where they find themselves in front of Ian's high school. Infuriated at Barley's advice, Ian lashes out at him for leading them on a wild goose chase and walks away with Wilden.Rereading his list of things he always wished to do with Wilden, Ian realizes that Barley has been a father figure throughout his entire life, and returns to make amends. Barley discovers the needed gem inside a historic fountain across the street from high school and retrieves it, unwittingly triggering the curse Corey spoke of, which creates a dragon-shaped golem out of pieces of the school and other nearby objects, bent on claiming the gem. Ian's staff is knocked into the ocean during a battle with the golem, but he reforms it from a splinter embedded in his hand and continues the fight. Corey flies in carrying Laurel, who plunges the magic sword into the golem's heart, buying Ian time to cast the visitation spell and fully reform Wilden's body. Ian sends Barley ahead to finally give his proper goodbye to Wilden, and holds off the golem long enough for Laurel to destroy it. After Wilden dissipates, Barley tells Ian that their father is proud of him, and the brothers share a hug.Some time later, Ian's confidence and spell-casting have improved and he surprises Barley by painting his new van, christened ""Guinevere The Second"". Corey reopens her tavern in its original spirit, drawing in customers with tales of past adventures. She and Laurel become friends, and Ian and Barley develop a better relationship with Colt, who was inspired to start galloping with his own feet. As the world begins to rediscover the magical arts of the past, the brothers set off on a new quest."
The Croods: A New Age,2020,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2850386/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The prehistoric family the Croods are challenged by a rival family the Bettermans, who claim to be better and more evolved. Still searching for a place to settle down after the cataclysmic events ofThe Croods (2013), the overprotective prehistoric patriarch, Grug, leads his family to the great unknown. Hoping for the best in an increasingly dangerous world, while trying to come to terms with Eep and Guy's budding romance, Grug stumbles upon a secluded Eden of plenty, containing everything that they have been seeking. However, there is a catch. This verdant heaven on Earth is already occupied by the significantly more evolved Bettermans: Phil, Hope, and their daughter, Dawn. Now, as tensions boil over between the antagonistic clans, a new menace threatens the future of both families. Can the Croods and the Bettermans put aside their differences to fight the common enemy, and live to tell the tale?—Nick Riganas Set in prehistoric times, a family do everything that they can do in order to survive with the help of another family. Together, they set off on an adventure to find a great place to live and grow. Along the way, they face the challenges of the prehistoric world.—RECB3 A flashback shows the death of Guy's parents when he was a kid. As they drown in tar, they tell him to find somewhere called 'tomorrow'. He goes on a long journey to find it and in the process, meets a young Belt before taking him along for the ride.Some time after the events of the first movie, the Croods (along with Guy and their pets Chunky and Douglas) are still searching for a place to settle down at all while surviving many dangerous creatures along the way. Grug is repeatedly annoyed at Eep and Guy's blossoming romance and it gets worse when he overhears them thinking about settling down together somewhere else away from the Croods. As Grug walks off in anger, he soon comes across a giant wall and leads the whole pack to them. When they bust inside, they see that the wall covers a huge land full of fruits and streams and they believe they have finally found a place to call their home. They are soon caught in a net and are released by the owners of the land, a couple called the Bettermans, Phil and Hope. When the Bettermans meet Guy, they reveal that they know each other from Guy's late parents.The Bettermans welcome the Croods to their giant tree-home as house guests, where they meet their daughter and Guy's old friend, Dawn, who immediately befriends Eep. Life with the Bettermans becomes degrading for Grug due to their evolved lifestyle rubbing off on his family like Thunk getting hooked on watching stuff from their window (similar to a television) and them sleeping in separate beds rather than together and the Bettermans soon reveal themselves to be biased against the cave family because of how destructive they are, believing that Guy is better off with them and hatch a scheme to get Guy to leave the Croods. Phil eventually takes Grug to his secret man-cave (a sauna-like place behind some waterfalls) where he manipulates him into believing Guy should leave their pack. Also, Hope gets on Ugga's bad-side by passive-aggressively saying they should leave while Guy remains with them.Eep and Dawn soon take use Chunky to escape the land and jump their wall for a joyride that ends with a bee stinging Dawn and having her hand swell up. When Eep takes her back home, Guy, upon finding out, chides her for her recklessness, ending with him insensitively calling her a 'cave-girl'. At dinner, tensions rise between the parents, Guy and Eep, especially when Dawn's swelling is revealed. Having enough, the Croods decide to leave in the morning, but Guy decides to stay after he and Eep have a falling out. Soon, the land is attacked by 'Punch-Monkeys' (monkeys with human-like strength) on account of Grug and Ugga eating a bunch of bananas the Bettermans hoard around their land and have forbidden Grug from eating. Phil reveals he sends the Punch-Monkeys the bananas every day so that they leave the Bettermans alone and since Grug and Ugga ate them, the Punch-Monkeys get upset and kidnap Grug, Phil, and Guy and take them to their homeland.As the men are taken, Thunk, Ugga, Eep, Gran, Sandy, Belt, Sash (Dawn's pet sloth), Hope, and Dawn go to rescue them, but eventually get marooned on an island full of Dog-Spiders. During their time together, Hope soon grows to accept the Croods and eventually form a team called the Thundersisters (which was an old girl-group Gran was in when she was younger) to mount a rescue and in the process, Gran revealed that her hair was just a furry bat. At the Punch-Monkey home, Grug, Guy and Phil soon discover that Phil unintentionally deprived the Punch-Monkeys of their water resource and that the Punch-Monkeys need the bananas not only to eat, but to offer to a giant Punch-Monkey in hopes of appeasing it. Since the bananas are gone, they need a substitute. The monkeys make Grug and Phil fight gladiator-style to see who will be the sacrifice and when they wear each other out, they exchange their bitter feelings with each other, making Guy regret what he said during his and Eep's fallout.Soon, the monkeys dress all 3 men as bananas to sacrifice to the giant Punch-Monkey. Grug and Phil apologize for their poor behavior and for putting pressure on Guy, but just as they are about to be eaten, the Thundersisters show and to rescue them. A long and perilous battle soon ends with Guy and Eep on a giant skull-chandelier where they reconcile and soon use it to defeat the giant Punch-Monkey by using fire to cut the ropes and send it falling into the abyss below when it catches Eep's 'peanut toe' (which she uses as a prosthetic limb) and pulls it off, allowing the families to escape.With their differences finally settled, the Bettermans allow the Croods to live in their land as neighbors, with Guy realizing that Eep is his 'tomorrow' and he and Eep soon move into one of the Betterman's bedrooms together and Grug finally accepts his daughter leaving with Guy."
Tenet,2020,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6723592/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Armed with only one word, Tenet, and fighting for the survival of the entire world, a Protagonist journeys through a twilight world of international espionage on a mission that will unfold in something beyond real time. In a twilight world of international espionage, an unnamed CIA operative, known as The Protagonist, is recruited by a mysterious organization called Tenet to participate in a global assignment that unfolds beyond real time. The mission: prevent Andrei Sator, a renegade Russian oligarch with precognitive abilities, from starting World War III. The Protagonist will soon master the art of ""time inversion"" as a way of countering the threat that is to come.—jesusblack-91294 After having a near-death experience, an unnamed CIA operative, known as the Protagonist, is selected to join the ranks of the shadowy government organization called Tenet: a group tasked with ensuring the survival of the human race. Entrusted with coming to grips with a terrifying, cutting-edge technology, and an imminent attack from the future, the Protagonist teams up with his cryptic new partner, Neil, following a faint trail of clues that lead to the villainous Russian oligarch, Sator. However, this is a race against time, and as the suffocating stranglehold of the invisible threat tightens, more and more, the future of our world is hanging by a thread. Can two agents working alone avert the impending Armageddon?—Nick Riganas In Kiev, Ukraine, an unnamed operative, The Protagonist (John David Washington), assists in a CIA assignment to foil an opera siege and retrieve a stolen cache of plutonium. His mission also seems to be to rescue a man, which he does so with the help of a team with whom he blends in with SWAT teams. During the operation, the plutonium is found to be fake. Furthermore, The Protagonist realizes that the opera was being bombed and so he collects the bombs to save the people. The Protagonist is at gunpoint by one SWAT member but is saved by a masked gunman with a red string on his back. The masked man appeared to be using a time-reversed gun. The Protagonist throws the bag of bombs away and the people are saved. He is then abducted and tortured until he bites on an apparent suicide pill before revealing any information.Upon waking, the Protagonist learns the pill was a test of his loyalty. He also is told that his team didn't get clear. He is recruited into a secret organization, given only the information that the word ""Tenet"" and a cross-fingered gesture will ""open many doors"" for him. The Protagonist infiltrates a facility where he learns that in the future, technology has been developed that allows objects to have their entropy reversed and move backward through time. To demonstrate this, a scientist presents him with bullets that fire in reverse. The scientist believes that there is a war coming as objects are being streamed back in time from the future.Tracking the metal from which the reversed bullets are made, the Protagonist infiltrates the compound of an Indian billionaire in Mumbai with the aid of Neil (Robert Pattinson), a British intelligence agent. He learns that it is in fact the billionaire's wife, Priya (Dimple Kapadia), who knows what is happening. Priya tells the Protagonist that the time-reversing technology is under the control of a Russian arms dealer, Andrei Sator (Kenneth Branagh), who is in communication with the future.The Protagonist meets Sir Michael Crosby (Michael Caine) who tells him that an explosion went off in a now-abandoned city in Russia known as Stalsk-12. The Protagonist learns from him that in order to get to Sator, he needs to approach his ""practically estranged"" wife Kat (Elizabeth Debecki). The Protagonist meets Kat and they talk at a restaurant. Kat tells the Protagonist that Sator has her under his control due to a forged painting that she gave to him. She also mentions that she tried to love him again to see if he would let her go free but Sator gave her the option to stay or leave and never see her son again. She says she saw a woman dive off their yacht in Vietnam when they were on holiday. Sator's men arrive at the restaurant soon. The Protagonist manages to fight his way and escape but one of them drives away with Kat just as the Protagonist finishes the last henchman.The Protagonist later tries to win Kat's trust by retrieving the painting from a freeport at Oslo Airport. Neil goes first to inspect the situation and they plan to crash a cargo plane to start a fire to activate the lockdown procedure, allowing them to steal the painting. They take the help of Mahir (Himesh Patel), who crashes the aircraft and drops gold bars on the road as a distraction. During the operation, however, the Protagonist and Neil are attacked by two masked men, one inverted and one forward who emerged from a temporal stile in the pentagon. Both antagonists escape before the Protagonist and Neil are able to find out who they are. The Protagonist meets Priya who tells him that the two antagonists were the same person.The Protagonist returns to Kat, asking for her help in meeting Sator. Kat arranges for the Protagonist to attend a dinner party, hosted by Sator, but the oligarch does not trust the Protagonist until he mentions ""opera"". The Protagonist, Kat, and Sator go sailing where Sator and the Protagonist are discussing about plutonium when Kat pushes Sator out of the boat. The Protagonist saves him and Kat is mad at him for that. Sator says he is in debt so he funds the Protagonist who offers to steal weapons-grade plutonium for him.The Protagonist and Neil plan a heist on a highway and they succeed in stealing the plutonium, which is in an orange case, from an armored vehicle but they are interrupted by an inverted car. The car chases them until they see an inverted Sator holding a forward Kat at gunpoint in it. A crashed Saab on the road flips back and drives backward in between them. Sator signals the Protagonist to hand over the plutonium but the Protagonist hands over an empty orange case and throws the plutonium into the Saab. The Protagonist uncovers Sator and his gang's plot: they are operating a ""temporal pincer movement"" in which they move both forwards and backward in time, by means of entering a ""temporal stile"" following the operation and then moving backward through time.At the ""temporal junction"", Sator shoots Kat and leaves with her before Neil calls for reinforcements and they arrive to secure the temporal stile. The Protagonist suspects them, questioning Neil about who these people are. Neil tells him they are Priya's men, a team led by Ives (Aaron Taylor Johnson). The Protagonist follows Sator back through the temporal stile despite being warned not to, where he turns out to be the driver of the Saab. He puts a radio device on an empty orange casing on the road and waits for it to go back into a car. He follows it and it turns out Sator saw the plutonium flying from the Saab back into forward Protagonist's hands. He hears from the device that Sator had assembled the algorithm (the fake plutonium pieces) which are being taken to the hypocentre. In the chase, the Saab crashes with the inverted Protagonist inside it. Sator burns the car which turns into ice and manages to get hold of the algorithm piece off-screen. The Protagonist is rescued by Ives' team.Sator is revealed to be dying from inoperable pancreatic cancer and has turned omnicidal, believing that if he is to die, he would prefer to spread death to all humanity. Sator is not looking for plutonium, but some future algorithm (9 pieces of the fake plutonium) that can cause the entropy ""time direction"" of the world to reverse. The algorithm will be created in the future by a future scientist as a way to turn back time since their future Earth is ruined by decisions made by present-day humans. Sator plans to use the algorithm as a doomsday device that will reverse entropy for the entire Earth, killing everything on it. He plans to return to a point in time when he was happy with Kat and then set off the device, which is connected to a dead man's switch linked to his heartbeat.The Protagonist, Neil, and Kat follow Sator backward in time, travelling in a cargo ship container back to Oslo. The trio infiltrates the freeport art storage facility once again where they enter the temporal stile that allows Kat to move forwards through time again and have her gunshot wound healed. The Protagonist soon discovers he was, in fact, the unknown antagonist during their first operation at the freeport and hence has to fight his past self to go through.The Protagonist meets Priya to ask her to warn his past self about how dangerous Sator is. However, she says she won't change what is about to happen. The Protagonist wants her word that Kat will be safe. This is because she has seen too much of what they are trying to keep secret - a loose end. Priya gives him her word. She also reveals to him that Tenet will be founded in the future. She says Ives has a team ready for the mission.They travel further back in time, where a military operation is launched whereby the Protagonist and Neil attempt to retrieve the doomsday device from Sator's men from the future in Stalsk-12, while Kat is with her husband on his yacht, aiming to prevent him from killing himself before the doomsday device is retrieved. They operate in a temporal pincer movement where the red team moves forward covering the blue team's extraction and the blue team moves backward covering the red team's extraction. The Protagonist and Ives are on the red team while Neil is on the blue team.Neil uses a temporal stile there to invert back to forward, halfway through the operation, to warn the Protagonist and Ives about a trap that he witnessed planted by Volkov - one of Sator's men. However, Neil's efforts are in vain. The Protagonist and Ives enter the tunnel and get stuck in there. They go deeper and find the place where the doomsday device is monitored by Volkov who is behind a gate that is locked. They also see a member of the blue team dead beside Volkov with a red string attached to his bag. The Protagonist recognizes this unknown person from the opera siege. Sator talks to the Protagonist from the boat about his plan through a communication device in the tunnel. Sator explains that since that future is dying so they have no other option than to turn back to the past. Sator then orders Volkov to shoot the Protagonist in the head when the dead body emerges, takes the shot and the gate unlocks. The Protagonist and Ives kill Volkov and retrieve the doomsday device. The blue team member closes the gate and goes back to the entrance.Time is running out. Neil who has switched halfway throws a rope through the hole on top of the tunnel and the Protagonist and Ives hold on as they are pulled up. Kat kills Sator on the boat. The explosion goes off but the world is saved. Kat realizes that she was the woman her past self had seen on the boat and dives into the water.Ives breaks the algorithm into 3 pieces and divides it between himself, the Protagonist, and Neil. Ives emphasizes that they should keep it secret. Neil passes his piece to the Protagonist as he intends to go back in. It was then that the Protagonist notices that Neil has a red string on his back. He deduces that Neil was therefore the masked man who saved him during the opera siege and the blue team member who gets killed by Volkov inside the tunnel. The Protagonist sheds tears as he knows his friend's destiny now. Neil reveals that he was hired into this operation in past by the future Protagonist and thus has known him for years. Neil tells the Protagonist that he'll see him at the beginning and goes back into the operation with the blue team.The Protagonist then saves Kat from being killed by Priya after all of the film's events, revealing that it is his job to tie up loose ends and that he has been the leader of Tenet operations for two years in the past."

However, even though the exceptional team of traumatised inmates believes that they're being treated and cared for, before long, they all start to experience horrifying hallucinations. But, this institution was supposed to be a safe place. Are they patients or prisoners?—Nick Riganas The film starts with Dani Moonstar (Blu Hunt) mentioning how her father used to tell her that inside everyone were two bears - the good one made up of compassion and kindness, and the evil one made up of fears and aggression. Cut to Dani waking up as her father William (Adam Beach) waking her up, as their reservation appears to be hit by a tornado. As the residents flee, William hides Dani behind a tree as he goes to help the others. Moments later, William is thrown back in front of Dani, dead. She tries to run for it as a a growling entity approaches her, but she tumbles down a hill.Dani wakes up in a facility. She meets Dr. Cecilia Reyes (Alice Braga), who tells her that she is in a kind of hospital for people with abilities like hers, and that she is the sole survivor of the incident on the reservation. Reyes tells Dani that she is a mutant, but Dani is not aware of any powers she may has.Reyes holds a session with the other members of the facility - Rahne Sinclair (Maisie Williams), who has the power to turn into a wolf and suffered trauma from when the priest of her church tried to kill her; Illyana Rasputin (Anya Taylor-Joy), who carries a purple dragon hand puppet that she calls Lockheed; Roberto da Costa (Henry Zaga), who comes from a wealthy family from Brazil; and Sam Guthrie (Charlie Heaton), who appears with a black eye and broken arm. As Reyes tries to counsel the teens, Dani joins them. She is greeted with smarmy remarks from Roberto and Illyana. Reyes has Ilyana show Dani around the campus, but Illyana couldn't care less and just sprays graffiti on a nearby fountain. When Dani tries to run away, she ends up running into a force field. Illyana laughs at her, but when Dani tries to attack her, Illyana just disappears in a flash.Dani contemplates jumping from the clock tower, but Rahne comes up to talk her out of it and convince her to stick around. After helping her back in, Rahne shows Dani around the facility a little more. She shows Dani that Sam's superpower is flying at super speed, which he practices by hooking himself up to a large weight, and it causes him to hurt himself since he doesn't know how to fully control it. Roberto won't say what his power is, and the girls agree that Illyana is the worst.Dani returns to her room to sleep, while Reyes monitors her and the other teens. Dani dreams about the incident at her reservation, and Reyes notices readings of psionic energy coming from Dani.Sam and Roberto are in the laundry room until Roberto leaves. Sam hears a banging coming from one of the washing machines. He approaches it and sees a hand pressed against it. It takes him to a mine he used to work in back in Kentucky. He walks past other miners until he reaches his father (Thomas Kee), who appears undead. Sam is then blasted against the wall by the force in the machine.Later, the teens are in the recreation room, when Illyana makes more derogatory comments to Dani (""Pocahontas"", ""Standing Rock""). Dani doesn't take the abuse any longer and calls out Illyana's behavior, which leads to them fighting. After Dani punches her, Illyana's right arm produces the Soulsword, which she almost uses against Dani until Reyes comes in and uses her force field to stop the fight, then put the girls in solitary confinement. Dani overhears Illyana whispering to herself in her room. She is shown having a flashback to her childhood where a tall, gaunt man in a smiley mask loomed over her. Dani later has a nightmare where she finds herself in the snowy woods close to where she lost her home and father, and a monstrous entity tries to attack her. Reyes finds her covered in something wet, and she proceeds to take more tests from Dani.Rahne goes to the chapel for confession. She hears what sounds like a voice telling her she is inhuman and will go to Hell. Rahne runs out of the chapel to avoid what she thinks is a demon.After Reyes falls asleep, Sam and Roberto invite Dani and Rahne to join them (and Illyana) up in the attic since it's the one place that is apparently not monitored. They mention Reyes's superior that she keeps alluding to, stating that after their time there, they may go to the facility for special mutants. The guys think she is talking about Professor Xavier and his Mutant Academy. Illyana then has them do lie detector tests, wherein it is revealed that she killed 18 men in her old town. She asks Dani about her bear necklace, which was given to her by her father.It turns out Reyes was monitoring the attic as well and tries to admonish the teens for disobeying her. Later, Illyana spikes her tea to get her to pass out, and the teens proceed to have fun. Dani and Rahne dance together, Illyana makes fun of Reyes, and Sam and Roberto spend time together. Sam tells Roberto that he accidentally killed his father and half the miners when he lost control of his powers. Roberto refuses to say what happened that got him into the facility. Dani and Rahne go outside where Rahne shows Dani the night sky under the force field, which looks lovely. The two then share their first kiss. Meanwhile, Roberto finds Illyana in the pool. They start to hook up, but he reveals that he burned his girlfriend to death with his powers. Illyana says he cannot hurt her, but moments later, she appears to vanish. A demonic creature appearing as Roberto's girlfriend on fire then tries to attack him. He rages out and his fire powers are activated. The others come in to help him, and Reyes pushes him into the pool. Illyana appears and says she was never in the pool.Reyes punishes Illyana for drugging her by confining her to her room. Rahne takes a shower and sees the demonic image of her priest (Happy Anderson), whom she killed, approaching her with a W branding iron similar to one he used on her back years earlier. The priest brands Rahne's neck, and the others try to calm her down. Illyana somehow gets out of her room and tells the others that all of this is happening because of Dani. She tries to attack her again with the Soulsword and transports her briefly to a hellish landscape before Dani snaps her out by manifesting one of the creepy smiley masks to scare Illyana. Reyes runs more tests on Dani, and Dani starts seeing visions of mutant children being tortured at the Transigen facility (from ""Logan""), making her realize that they are not going to be sent to the Mutant Academy. Reyes reports to her real employers, the Essex Corporation, who determine that Dani's power makes her a threat, and that she must be killed.Dani goes to Illyana's room to try and talk to her. She gives her back Lockheed since she dropped him, and Dani asks her where she transported her to. Illyana says it's Limbo. She explains that her powers manifested when she was kept as a prisoner by the men in masks (Smiley Men).Reyes takes Dani away for what is supposedly one last test. Rahne follows as she knows something is not right. Reyes tries to put Dani to sleep before injecting her IV with poison. Rahne uses her wolf powers to sneak through the vents and attack Reyes, clawing at her until she flees, and Rahne saves Dani. Meanwhile, Illyana and Roberto are attacked by the Smiley Men, who remove their masks to reveal their hideous blind faces. After using the Soulsword and Sam's speed to kill the Smiley Men, the teens go into Reyes's office to find files on them. Illyana was the most viable candidate for Essex since she is classified as a killer, but they learn that Dani's power was going to have her killed. They figure that, in order to leave the facility, they have to find Reyes and kill her.Rahne sniffs out Reyes's trail, but she traps the teens in her own force fields. She tells them that Dani's power is to bring out your greatest fears and traumas to use against you. Before she can kill Dani, the facility comes under attack by the Demon Bear, the entity that destroyed Dani's home. The Demon Bear mauls Reyes to death, which breaks the force fields, but the Demon Bear proceeds to attack the teens. Illyana goes into Limbo with the Soulsword and brings Lockheed to life to fight the monster. They take the fight to the chapel, where Dani is unconscious as she feels she is not strong enough to fight it. Sam and Roberto unleash their own powers to fight back, while Rahne wolfs out to claw at the creature's face. As the others are getting demolished even with their powers, Dani sees a vision of her father encouraging her to fight back. Just before the Demon Bear can devour Rahne, Dani wakes up and talks to it calmly, bringing it to a non-monstrous form that goes to rest and no longer harm them.The sun rises on the new day. The teens discover that the force field barrier has gone down, meaning they are free. Dani thanks the others for saving her, but Rahne says she saved them. They all then decide to head into the nearest town as they start new lives."

Underwater,2020,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5774060/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A crew of oceanic researchers working for a deep sea drilling company try to get to safety after a mysterious earthquake devastates their deepwater research and drilling facility located at the bottom of the Mariana Trench. An unknown, massive earthquake happens in a drilling station in the bottom of the Marianna Trench. A scientific crew must find their way across the ocean floor into another station under the threats of deep pressure, dark water, dangerous deep-sea creatures, and a constant lack of oxygen.—joel The film begins with images of the Mariana Trench and describing Tian Industries' intention to drill seven miles to the bottom for resources. Norah Price (Kristen Stewart), a mechanical engineer at the Keppler 822 Station, is brushing her teeth when the ceiling starts to trickle water. A large earthquake hits, and the Keppler starts to suffer catastrophic breach from the pressure. Price tries to wake everyone up but only she and another worker named Rodrigo (Mamoudou Athie) are able to escape the area and close it off, preventing further damage to the Keppler. Trying to find a way off the Keppler via escape pods, they encounter Paul (T.J. Miller) under the rubble and crawl through an access point to reach the escape pod bay. All of the escape pods have already been deployed, with Captain Lucien (Vincent Cassel) being the only person in the area when the three arrive.The surviving crew reaches a control base and find biologist Emily Haversham (Jessica Henwick) and engineer Liam Smith (John Gallagher Jr.). Trying to reach out via radio, they are unsuccessful in making contact with the surface. Lucien then recommends that they put on pressurized suits and walk one mile across the ocean floor to the Roebuck Station 641. They start to emerge from the station into a cargo elevator, but Rodrigo's helmet is faulty and cracks from the pressure, killing him instantly. The surviving crew see a distress beacon from one of the escape pods below, and Smith and Paul go outside to investigate. As Smith and Paul arrive at the location, the pod has been ripped open and a body lies in the rubble. Paul inspects the body, only for a hatchling creature to emerge from it and attack him. Smith is able to shoot and kill it with a bolt gun, and they bring it inside. Studying the creature's body, Haversham realizes it is a part of a previously undiscovered species. The five begin to set out towards the Roebuck Station, but as they are walking, the Keppler explodes, causing debris to fly towards them. Smith is hit by the debris, but Price and Lucien manage to save him and bring him inside. They are able to make it to the meet-point station by taking an access tunnel, allowing them to charge and clean their suits, but find that Smith's oxygen source is badly damaged from the debris. As they make their way through the access tunnel, Paul is attacked by a creature and is dragged underwater before being ripped out of his suit and killed.Before leaving the access tunnel, the team discover that Smith's damaged oxygen pod will cause him to have to breathe in toxic fumes from the explosion. Unwilling to leave another crew member behind, Price, Lucien and Haversham agree to help him walk, dragging him if they have to. The remaining four crew members press on and start their walk across the ocean floor, but another creature appears, dragging Smith into a cave. Lucien manages to pull Smith out, but then tries to go for Smith's bolt gun, allowing the creature an opportunity to drag Lucien up through the water and away from the other three. Price follows the creature and Lucien and is able to free him, but Lucien sacrifices himself so that Price may escape the increasing change in pressure. Price ends up at the abandoned Sheppard Station and finds that Lucien worked there beforehand, causing suspicion as to what Lucien really knew about these creatures and their involvement with the drilling stations. Price tries to make contact with Smith and Haversham, but to no avail. She then gets a new pressurized suit and leaves the Sheppard, continuing toward the Roebuck. Walking along the ocean floor, Price reunites with Haversham, dragging Smith towards the Roebuck Station, and proceeds to help. As they enter the station, they notice that there is a nest of creatures hanging from the ceiling and try to sneak by, but Haversham's suit, low on oxygen, begins to make noise, causing one of them to wake up and attack Price. Price is partially swallowed by the creature, but is able to kill it and break free, allowing them to continue their way into the Roebuck.The three are able to reach the escape pod bay, but Price discovers that only two work, with a third being damaged and unusable. Price and Haversham manage to get an ailing but still alive Smith into one of the pods, and Price eventually convinces Haversham to take the last one. As this is happening, a gigantic version of the creature that attacked them emerges from around the Roebuck, surrounded by even more creatures. The creatures start to follow the two escape pods, while the gigantic one begins to attack the Roebuck. Price, knowing she is already going to die, raises the energy levels of the core engines so that they may explode, killing all the creatures in the vicinity and allowing the escape pods to reach the surface safely. The film ends with images of newspaper articles depicting Tian Industries and their attempts to cover up the incident, silencing Haversham and Smith. The company goes on to say that they intend to expand their drilling efforts."

Jack is introduced to assistant coach and algebra teacher Dan, as well as members of the team. Bishop Hayes has only won one game, and has not gone to the playoffs since Jack was a student. As a result, student interest in basketball has dropped greatly, leaving the team with just six varsity players. Among these players are Brandon, the team's introverted point guard and most talented player, and Marcus, the team's center, who aggravates his teammates and Jack with his attitude.Angela meets with Jack and reveals that she is seeing someone new.

But their master plan is about to be derailed when one of the hunted, Crystal, turns the tables on her pursuers.—krmanirethnam A group of strangers, for those of them who end up counting they numbering twelve, wake up with locked gags around their mouths in a wooded area surrounding a field, their exact locale unknown, and they not knowing what's going on. They find both the master key to unlock the gags, and a crate in the middle of the field containing a live dressed up pig and a cache of weapons. Believing they will need the weapons perhaps for their survival, they end up arming themselves which is when they begin to be attacked from afar, some to their deaths. A large number of them begin to believe that they are involved in Manorgate, a story that went viral on the Internet: a group of elitists in Vermont who hunt man for sport, and the weapons provided to them are just to give them a sense of a fighting chance. Some of the group are able to escape what they believe is the game area, but they still have to determine what/who is friend or foe among those and the situations they encounter ""outside"". But it is one, who may be the outlyer among the twelve, that may have the best chance of survival in assessing the situation as it happens as opposed to fitting the situation into the Manorgate story. As such, she may actually come to discover what is going on and that the twelve were specifically chosen for this exercise.—Huggo In a group text, Athena Stone anticipates an upcoming hunt of ""deplorables"" at a manor. Later, on her private jet, she kills a man who staggers out from the cargo hold.Eleven captives wake up gagged, in a forest, for the hunt.

The station's owners, an elderly couple consisting of Miranda ""Ma"" and Julius ""Pop"", identify their location as a point on Route 31 near Elaine, Arkansas. The three escapees, each kidnapped from a different part of the United States, realize their situation's similarity to the ""Manorgate"" conspiracy theory. One of the three eats a poisoned donuts and collapses, while Ma and Pop (who are among the captors' ranks) kill the rest with poison gas. They then clean up the station for the next person to come in.A fourth captive, Crystal Creasey, arrives.

Dale. Athena calls out to Don via radio, asking if he killed Crystal. When Don refuses to disarm, Crystal kills him. Crystal tortures the wounded Sgt. Dale to get Athena's location and then kills him.A flashback reveals that Athena's group text exchange was a joke. However, it was leaked on the internet, creating furor over ""Manorgate"". Subsequently, the group text's participants, whose careers were ruined, decide to make Manorgate come true. They abducted people who shared and produced internet materials relating to Manorgate. Athena is personally offended by a social media post Crystal had made about her, and insists on her inclusion, nicknaming her ""Snowball"".When Crystal confronts Athena, Athena mocks Crystal's personal history. Crystal tells Athena that she's confused her with another Crystal from her hometown, but her middle name is spelled May, rather than Mae. Crystal and Athena get into a drawn out fight, eventually impaling one another on the two blades of a food processor; Athena dies, but Crystal gets a second wind upon seeing a jackrabbit appear near Athena's body.

Cap sends Joel some berries, which he recognizes as poisonous. Realizing Cap is not to be trusted, he rushes to warn Aimee but is knocked unconscious.Joel, Aimee, and the rest of her colony are tied up on the beach.

Boy returns and saves Aimee, who steals a hand cannon from one of the pirates.

Frank and Ava,2020,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5963314/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Before he was chairman of the board. He was just a man, desperate for a woman, clinging to a dream. The story of Sinatra as never told before and Ava Gardner, the woman who saved him, by breaking him. Based on true stories. The steel line of sex and tension is palpable throughout this harrowing and heart-stirring Hollywood romance between Frank Sinatra and Ava Gardner. It's 1949 and Sinatra, the former king of swoon who once enchanted millions of ""bobby soxers"", is at the downturn of his career as the once golden ""Voice"" is now compromised by a hemorrhage to his vocal cords while his reputation is lambasted by the press who parade his alleged Mafia connections, liberal sympathies, and extramarital affairs. In the midst of his despair, he falls hard and fast for Gardner, MGM's sultry starlet with whom he shares proclivities for passion, whiskey, obstinacy, and sexual infidelities. Equal to his desire to maintain the interest of the mercurial Gardner, is his almost sacred infatuation aimed at attaining the role of Private Angelo Maggio in Columbia Picture's From Here to Eternity, the sole ray of hope in salvaging his career. An acknowledged long shot due to his questionable acting chops and heretofore box office bombs, Sinatra actively campaigns for the role while divorcing his wife, Nancy, and entering a sexually charged, but suspicion-filled marriage with Gardner that is marked by infidelities, Ava's abortions and Frank's suicide attempts as their hapless romance is parodied by the press who play them off each other. Acclaimed director, Michael Oblowitz, impeccably stylized the film, using locations in Rome, Italy, Hollywood, CA and Sinatra's Palm Springs home to bring Frank and Ava to life. In addition to introducing Rico Simonini and Emily Elicia Low in the title roles, the film also features Eric Roberts, Lukas Haas, Richard Portnow, Domenick Lombardozzi, Neil Sandilands, Jonathan Silverman, Terry Moore and the legendary Harry Dean Stanton; in his last feature film appearance.—Rico Simonini In 1949, a downcast Frank, the former king of swoon who once enchanted millions of ""bobby soxers"", finds his career on the wane because of a faltering voice, a failing marriage, and a tarnished off screen reputation. He falls in love with rising star, Ava Gardner, by consensus, the most beautiful woman in Hollywood and the romance was instantly incandescent! Despite this they were hapless as a couple; often pursued by reporters such as Hedda Hopper who played them off against each other in the tabloids; casting Frank as an adulterer and Ava as a home wrecker while Frank's wife, Nancy, initially refused to grant him a divorce. Once married in 1951 the tabloids then paraded their sorted affairs whenever their careers separated them. (Often it was Ava who went off to Europe or Africa to make a movie, leaving Frank behind). In the meantime, Frank, career hanging by a thread, is desperately trying to land the acting job that he believes will turn his fortunes, the role of Private Angelo Maggio in upcoming Columbia Pictures film, From Here to Eternity. Although Frank pulls all stops to land the ""Maggio"" role while trying to keep tight reigns on Ava it becomes apparent that these are both long-shots. Frank is not highly regarded as an actor, having starred in recent ""flops"" and the couple appear doomed as both are hard drinking, profane, independent mirror images of each other who readily blur the lines of monogamy. Their fights are wild and savage, as they exchange insults and even blows with Ava often walking off leaving a desperate Sinatra alone to repeated suicide attempts upon on hearing of each of Ava's various paramours. Eventually they separate, with Ava remaining in Spain where she filmed The Barefoot Contessa and took up with famous matador, Luis Miguel Dominion. Eventually, whether through the persuasion of Ava, the mob, or his persistence, Frank does land the Maggio role and From Here to Eternity becomes an ultimate success and extricates Frank from obscurity with his Academy Award win for Best Supporting Actor, capping one of the greatest comebacks in Hollywood history. The podium, however, is bittersweet as it is a Pyrrhic victory as the broken-heart Frank celebrates alone. ""Frank and Ava"" also features interviews with various ""witnesses"", including Academy Award winner, Shirley Jones to give docudrama accounts of the events portrayed in the film."

Promising Young Woman,2020,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9620292/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A young woman, traumatized by a tragic event in her past, seeks out vengeance against those who crossed her path. Pushing thirty, and defined by a hideous crime involving her bosom friend, Nina, emotionally scarred medical school dropout, Cassie, knows firsthand that some wounds never heal. Leading an uneventful existence, still living with her parents, waiting tables at a cheap coffee shop to earn a living, Cassie has found the perfect way to deal with the painful past. Dressed to kill, at night, Cassie frequents the local bars and nightclubs, pretending to be dead-drunk, utterly helpless and vulnerable. And, every week, lethally beautiful Cassie is on the prowl for all sorts of nocturnal predators and other wolves in sheep's clothing, who are unaware that, sometimes, the hunter can become the prey. Then, Ryan, a kindly and caring old classmate who is the bee's knees, enters the picture, and just like that, Cassie wants out. However, everybody knows that breaking bad habits is easier said than done. Could Ryan be the one?—Nick Riganas Nothing in Cassie's life is what it appears to be -- she's wickedly smart, tantalizingly cunning, and she's living a secret double life by night. Now, an unexpected encounter is about to give Cassie a chance to right the wrongs from the past. The film starts in a nightclub where friends Jerry (Adam Brody), Paul (Sam Richardson), and Jim (Ray Nicholson) are having drinks. They notice a young woman, Cassandra ""Cassie"" Thomas (Carey Mulligan), appearing too drunk to pick herself up. Paul and Jim make misogynistic comments toward her, but Jerry goes to approach her and try to get her home. Jerry brings her back to his apartment where he starts to kiss her. When Cassie says she needs to lie down, Jerry brings her to bed and starts trying to take her panties off. Cassie then drops the drunk act to sit upright and look Jerry dead in the eyes to ask him what he's doing. Jerry looks terrified.Cassie walks home the next morning with red stains on her clothes... but it's just the jelly dripping from the doughnut she is eating. A trio of construction workers then start catcalling her, but she bothers them when she just stares at them blankly.It is shown that Cassie is around age 30 and still lives with her parents Stanley (Clancy Brown) and Susan (Jennifer Coolidge). She also works a dead-end job as a waitress at a coffee shop with her only friend Gail (Laverne Cox) where she behaves with apathy toward customers. A former med school classmate, Ryan Cooper (Bo Burnham), now a pediatrician, enters the shop and recognizes Cassie. After some banter, Cassie spits in Ryan's coffee, but he still drinks it anyway and asks to take her out. She gives him a fake phone number.Later, Cassie is picked up by another sleazy guy named Neil (Christopher Mintz-Plasse), who is trying to pitch her his sexist novel idea while trying to get Cassie to snort cocaine with him. When Cassie says she wants to go home, Neil tries to get her to go to bed with him. She then reveals her sobriety to Neil and immediately freaks him out. Cassie gets closer to him as she calls him out for trying to take advantage of a seemingly drunk girl, and she leaves his apartment after nearly making him soil himself.Stanley and Susan give Cassie a pink briefcase as a gift for her birthday, which they were surprised to see she forgot. She takes it as an obvious hint that they want her to move out, as Stanley and Susan have frequently expressed concerns over Cassie's lack of ambitions.Ryan returns to the coffee shop after realizing Cassie gave him a fake number, and she finally relents and decides to go out with him. Although Ryan appears nice enough, Cassie doesn't let him get too close to her. She eventually apologizes and continues to date him. While hanging out at the coffee shop, Ryan mentions an old colleague, Alexander ""Al"" Monroe (Chris Lowell), who is getting married. The thought of it disturbs Cassie to her core, because when she was in med school, her childhood best friend Nina Fisher was raped by Al during a frat party while she was too drunk to stand. Although Cassie and Nina reported it to many people, few believed them and gave Al the benefit of the doubt, which led to Nina's suicide and Cassie dropping out of school.Cassie looks on social media to find many old peers congratulating Al on his engagement. Among them is a woman named Madison McPhee (Alison Brie). Cassie contacts Madison and arranges a lunch date with her. Cassie gets Madison very drunk before bringing up the case against Al with Nina. Madison acts aloof about it, stating that it was a long time ago and that someone with a reputation for always being very drunk was bound to end up in a situation like that. When Cassie sees that Madison is too drunk to know what's going on, she leaves after paying and is then seen speaking to another man while looking at Madison.Cassie later goes to a high school where she picks up a young girl named Amber (Francisca Estevez) by pretending that she is going to a diner to work for a popular boy band. Afterward, Cassie goes to see Dean Elizabeth Walker (Connie Britton) at her former med school. Cassie brings up how she and Nina reported Nina's assault to Walker, but she had taken Al's side in the ordeal and seems to not even remember Nina. Cassie then tells Walker that she picked up Amber and brought her to the same room where Nina was raped and left her with several older boys. Walker becomes terrified and tries to call Amber's phone, only to see that Cassie has it. After Walker admits she was wrong in not believing Nina, Cassie admits that she only left Amber at the diner where she is still waiting for the boy band, and she tells Walker where she can find her.Cassie's next target is a former lawyer, Jordan Greene (Alfred Molina). Like the rest of the names in Cassie's list, he was complicit in letting Al get off scot-free for what he did to Nina because he essentially forced her to drop the case. However, Greene knows he was wrong and is extremely remorseful for what happened with Nina. He cries next to Cassie, who forgives him. When she leaves, she speaks to an apparent hitman and tells him he is no longer needed.Cassie pays a visit to Nina's mother (Molly Shannon), where they reminisce about Nina, but Mrs. Fisher thinks Cassie's obsession with the ordeal is unhealthy and that she needs to move on.Cassie attempts another drunk-baiting trick, this time with Paul. As they are leaving together, Ryan is entering the same club and sees Cassie. She tries to explain herself to Ryan, but he is uninterested in what she has to say. When she finds him later, she tries to explain herself, and he ends up forgiving her, and they kiss.Madison sits on Cassie's front porch waiting for her after days of calling and leaving messages because she was worried something happened with the guy that Cassie had spoken to. Cassie admits that nothing happened and that the man only took her to bed, and he didn't touch her otherwise. Madison is relieved, but then she speaks to Cassie privately and admits that she was wrong for not believing Nina, and she reveals that a video of Al raping her had circulated, which she kept on an old phone. Madison gives Cassie the phone and asks her never to contact her again. Although a bit reluctant, Cassie watches the video. Apart from her horror at seeing Nina raped, she is most horrified when she sees that Ryan was there watching the event unfold.Cassie goes to Ryan's job to confront him about the video and him being there. She threatens to send it to everybody in his contacts, including the parents of his patients unless he tells her where Al is holding his bachelor party. Ryan becomes scared at the implications of what Cassie is planning to do, but he gives her the address. They part in anger, with Ryan disappointing Cassie by defending himself instead of apologizing and calls her a failure. She addresses him with contempt and warns him not to let any of the guys know she is coming.On the night of the bachelor party, Cassie dresses as a stripper and goes to the cabin where the party is being held. After getting the other guys drunk and drugged, Cassie takes Al up to the bedroom after telling him that's the only way she'll get paid. She handcuffs him to the bedpost before bringing up what he did to Nina. Al becomes panicky and emotional when she reveals there's a video of the rape which his loser friend Joe created, realizing he can't deny what happened any longer. He starts trying to get free and uses standard excuses (""We were kids"", ""Everyone was drunk"", etc) to defend his actions, but Cassie doesn't want to hear it. She grabs a scalpel and attempts to carve Nina's name into Al's stomach, but he breaks one hand free from the cuffs and smothers Cassie with a pillow. He spends a few minutes simply telling her to stop moving, then when he realizes she's dead, he sinks down next to her and is overcome with fear and emotion.The next morning, Al's friend Joe (Max Greenfield), comes upstairs to find Al crying with Cassie's dead body next to him. Joe tries to tell Al it wasn't his fault, while Al weepily says it was and that he fears losing his fiancé and everything else. Joe resolves to help Al get rid of the body and convinces him to go along with that, so that the other guys will not know what happened. They take Cassie and bury her under a pile of logs that they then set on fire. Joe calmly watches this while Al is sick to his stomach.Days later, Cassie's parents file a missing persons report. The lead detective visits Ryan's office since he knows they were romantically involved. After he learns Cassie disappeared, Ryan tries to save his skin by suggesting she may have done something to herself that he was unaware of.It is the day of Al's wedding. After the ceremony, we see Greene receiving an envelope from Cassie, along with a message in the event of her disappearance. Suddenly, Ryan and everyone else at the party receives the video of Al raping Nina. Ryan receives pre-written texts from Cassie saying ""You didn't think this was the end, did you? It is now. Enjoy the wedding!"" Police arrive, and after surveying the area, they find Cassie's remains, which contains the Nina half of her friendship heart necklace (Gail was given the Cassie half). Al is arrested in front of the crowd while Joe tries to sneak away. Ryan continues reading the messages, which end with ""Love, Cassie and Nina ;)"""

The Butcher comes to the high-school and attacks Millie, stabbing her shoulder with La Dola, but Char arrives and saves her sister. On the next morning, Millie and The Butcher learn that they have swapped bodies. Millie meets Nyla and Josh and their research show that she has twenty-four hours to stab The Butcher and swap bodies again; otherwise, she will be trapped forever in his body.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil On Wednesday the 11th, four teenagers are brutally murdered by a serial killer known as the Blissfield Butcher (Vince Vaughn), who was previously thought only to be an urban legend. During his murder spree, the Butcher steals a dagger known as EL DOLO (actual name unconfirmed) from a collection of ancient artifacts kept in the teenager's house where the murders took place.The next day, high school student Millie Kessler (Kathryn Newton) suffers bullying from various students, including cheerleader Ryler (Melissa Collazo), and teacher, Mr. Fletcher (Alan Ruck). Millie finds solace in her friends, Nyla (Celeste O'Connor) and Josh (Misha Osherovich), who is gay, and her crush, Booker (Uriah Shelton). Josh tries to convince Millie that she's ""a piece,"" while Nyla fears that Millie is so concerned with taking care of her mother that she fails to take care of herself. Millie lives with her older sister, police office Charlene ""Char"" Kessler (Dana Drori), and alcoholic mother, Paula Kessler (Katie Finneran). Her father died one year ago.Despite the emergency alert of the butchered teenagers, Blissfield Valley High School maintains its plans to host a homecoming dance on Friday the 13th. Against the protests of Nyla and Josh, Millie plans to skip the homecoming dance and spend the night at a theater play with her mother instead.That night, the night of Thursday the 12th, Millie works as the high school mascot, a beaver, for the homecoming football game. She declines a ride home from Nyla and Josh and instead waits for her mother to pick her up. Unbeknownst to Millie, her mother has suffered another alcoholic fit and is passed out on the couch. Night comes and the high school crowd disperses, leaving Millie alone, still waiting for her mother. As she waits, she spots the Blissfield Butcher across the street. As the Butcher begins to approach, Millie runs underneath the stands of the football stadium to hide. As she attempts to escape, she is tackled by the Butcher. The Butcher stabs Millie in the left shoulder with EL DOLO, causing an identical wound to appear on his left shoulder. Charlene arrives and shoots her gun in the air to scare off the Butcher. The police keep EL DOLO as evidence.The next day, Friday the 13th, the Butcher awakes in the body of Millie in her bedroom. Meanwhile, Millie awakes in the body of the Butcher on a filthy mattress in an abandoned shack. In Millie's body, the Butcher attempts to stab an oblivious Charlene in the back with a kitchen knife but is intervened by Millie's oblivious mother. ""Millie's"" strange behavior is attributed to shock from her attack. The Butcher decides to go to school in Millie's body to find more teenagers to kill.The Butcher gives Millie's body an updated appearance, wearing a high ponytail and red lipstick and borrowing a red leather jacket from Charlene. This new appearance gives ""Millie"" attention from her previous bullies, including the football team. While at school, the Butcher ignores Nyla and Josh. He kills Ryler by locking her in a cryo-tank. As he exits the murder scene, he is at first shocked by the appearance of two police officers walking down the hall but quickly realizes that they do not suspect him since he is in the body of a teenage girl.The real Millie, trapped in the Butcher's body, sneaks into school to try to find her friends. Sketch drawings of the Butcher is all over the news, so Millie must keep a low profile to avoid being recognized. She also struggles to adjust to her new body's newfound strength and size. Millie finds Nyla and Josh, who recognize her as the Butcher, and begins chasing them in an attempt to explain her situation. After a mild scuffle in the kitchen of the high school, Millie is able to disarm her friends long enough for her to do the school mascot's dance routine and their friendship handshake, proving that she is Millie after all. Nyla and Josh ask their Spanish teacher to translate an article about EL DOLO, which reveals that Millie has until midnight to stab the Butcher with EL DOLO or else the body switch will be permanent.Millie, Nyla, and Josh realize that the Butcher is ""a wolf in sheep's clothing"" and set out to find him. When they find the Butcher in the school hallways, he cries out for help, drawing the attention of police officers, students, and teachers in the school. Millie, Nyla, and Josh escape in Josh's car. They are chased by Charlene, who is on duty. They escape to the Discount Bonanza store, where Millie's mother works. Millie hides in a changing room, where she and her mother have a meaningful conversation through the changing room door. The exchange ends with Paula asking ""the Butcher"" on a date, to which Millie declines politely and says ""he"" is a married man. The Butcher kills Mr. Fletcher.Nyla and Josh find an Aaron Rodgers mask for Millie to don to avoid being recognized. As they leave the store, Josh discovers that the Butcher is at an arcade with a few members of the football team. The Butcher lures Booker into a laser tag arena. Millie, Nyla, and Josh arrive to save Booker. Millie knocks the Butcher and Booker unconscious.At Josh's house, Millie ties the Butcher to a chair. She and Nyla try to explain the situation to Booker, but he remains unconvinced until Millie recites a love poem that she anonymously slipped into his locker a few weeks earlier. Josh stays at his house with the Butcher while Millie, Nyla, and Booker go to the police station to obtain EL DOLO.Nyla enters the police station and tricks Charlene, the only police officer at the station, to look for the Butcher outside. While Charlene is outside, Nyla steals her keys and obtains EL DOLO from the evidence locker. Millie and Booker wait in the car and have a meaningful conversation in which Booker reveals he's liked Millie ""from day one."" Millie confides to him the newfound strength she feels being in the Butcher's body and not being bullied, but Booker tells her that strength is in your heart and your mind, not your size, and that Millie is really a lot stronger than she thinks she is.Josh's mother arrives home early to find ""Millie"" tied up in their kitchen. Josh attempts to convince his mother that he is actually straight and this is just part of sexual role playing. However, the Butcher slips out of the ropes tied around his wrists and chases Josh and his mother down the hallway with a kitchen knife.At the police station, Charlene catches Nyla stealing EL DOLO. Millie sees the Butcher run into the police station and follows in after him. Charlene attempts to put Millie in a jail cell, but Millie overpowers her and apologetically locks her in the cell instead. The Butcher escapes in a police car and almost runs over Josh.At the homecoming dance, the Butcher kills four football players. Millie, Nyla, Josh, and Booker drive back to the homecoming dance in search of the Butcher. Booker sets an alarm on Millie's Apple watch for midnight. They find the Butcher, and Nyla and Josh tackle him and hold him down while Booker staves off the police. As Millie prepares to stab him, her alarm beeps, indicating that it's too late and the curse is permanent. However, Josh notices that the bell hasn't rung yet, and Millie remembers when Booker gave her advice to set her clock five minutes late to prevent being late to classes. Millie realizes it is actually 11:55 PM and stabs the Butcher. They switch bodies just as the police discover the Butcher (now in his own body) and shoot him down.While in an ambulance, the Butcher removes his fingertip pulse oximeter to fake his death. Meanwhile, Charlene and Paula go to sleep. Millie discovers the back door open and is attacked by the Butcher. The Butcher torments her. He says that after being in her body, he understands why she's so anxious and weak. Charlene appears and orders the Butcher to freeze. She attempts to fire her gun, but the Butcher reveals he removed all its bullets. Suddenly, Paula smashes a wine bottle the Butcher's head. He quickly overpowers all three women, throwing Charlene into the TV, punching Paula in the face, and head-butting Millie. Millie admits that she also learned something from being in his body-that ""having balls sucks."" She kicks the Butcher in the balls and stabs him in the chest with a wooden post. She looks down at the dying Butcher and utters, ""I am a f---ing piece."""

Saju Rav (Randeep Hooda), a former Para (SF) operator and Ovi's protector, visits Ovi's father in prison. Unwilling to pay the ransom as it will hurt his prestige, Ovi Mahajan Sr. (Pankaj Tripathi) orders Saju to retrieve his son, threatening Saju's own family.Tyler Rake (Chris Hemsworth), a black-market mercenary and former SASR operator, is recruited by fellow mercenary Nik Khan (Golshifteh Farahani) to rescue Ovi from Dhaka, Bangladesh. Rake and Khan's team prepare to extract Ovi, with his father's men set to pay them once Ovi is recovered. Rake rescues Ovi, kills his captors, and takes him to the extraction point, but his father's men intentionally fail to transfer the funds. Instead, Saju kills Rake's teammates to bring Ovi back himself to avoid any payment to the mercenary group. Learning of Ovi's escape, Asif orders an immediate lockdown of Dhaka, securing all bridges out of the city.Khan arranges for a helicopter to extract Rake outside the city and tells him to abandon Ovi as they will not get paid for Ovi's extraction contract. He refuses, haunted by memories of his own son, who died at a young age from lymphoma when he left. After escaping Saju and the corrupt police and tactical units, Rake fights off a gang of boys led by Farhad, a young criminal determined to impress Asif. Rake calls his friend Gaspar (David Harbour), a retired squad-mate living in Dhaka, and he and Ovi lay low at Gaspar's home. Gaspar reveals Asif has placed a $10 million bounty on Ovi, which he offers to share if Rake allows him to kill Ovi. Rake refuses and fights Gaspar, who gains the upper hand but is fatally shot by Ovi.Rake calls Saju and asks for his help, forcing them to team up to escape Dhaka. Rake draws attention away from a disguised Saju and Ovi as the two make their way through a bridge checkpoint, then follows to cover their escape. Khan and her remaining mercenaries approach from the opposite side of the bridge, as Asif watches from afar with binoculars. In the ensuing firefight, Saju is sniped by Asif's colonel Rashid, who is in turn sniped by Khan. Wounded, Rake instructs Ovi to run to Khan's waiting helicopter. As Rake follows, he is shot in the neck by Farhad and, seeing Ovi is safe, falls into the river. Ovi, Khan, and the extraction team escape to Mumbai.Eight months later, Khan kills Asif in a men's restroom. Ovi jumps into his school's swimming pool and surfaces to see a man watching him."
Another Round,2020,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10288566/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Four high-school teachers consume alcohol on a daily basis to see how it affects their social and professional lives. There is a theory that man is born with half a per mille too little, that alcohol in the blood opens the mind to the outside world, problems seem smaller, and creativity increases. We know it well: after the first glass of wine, the conversation lifts, the possibilities open up. Martin is a high-school teacher who feels old and tired. His students and their parents want him terminated to increase their average. Encouraged by the per mille theory, Martin and his three colleagues throw themselves into an experiment to maintain a constant alcohol impact in everyday life. If Churchill won World War II in a dense fog of spirits, what could the strong drops do for them and their students? The result is positive in the beginning. Martin's class is in a different way now, and the project is being promoted to a real academic study with the collection of results. Slowly but surely, the alcohol makes the four friends and their surroundings loosen up. The results are rising, and they really begin to feel life. As the objects go inboard, the experiment progresses for some and goes off track for others. It becomes clearer and clearer that alcohol can generate great results in world history, but that all daring can also have consequences. The film is described as a fun, touching and thought-provoking drama about friendship, freedom--and alcohol.—Kenneth Kjær Four teachers embark on an experiment where they each sustain a certain level of alcohol intoxication during their everyday life, believing that all people in general would benefit from a bit higher Blood Alcohol Content. As a result, their working experiences are turned upside-down.—William Pilgaard-Jensen Amid an ongoing midlife crisis, Martin, Tommy, Nikolaj, and Peter--a close-knit group of friends, colleagues, and high school teachers--find themselves faced with stale careers, failing marriages, and the cruel certainty of lost youth. Then, after a long, booze-fueled night in town, the companions hit on the idea to keep themselves constantly semi-inebriated, inspired by an untried scientific theory claiming that when people maintain a golden 0.05% Blood Alcohol Concentration at all times, they are more relaxed, poised, and self-confident. Without delay, the grizzled friends set rules and start observing the effects of sustaining that perfect, low-level buzz, one glass at a time. However, are they prepared for the dangers and the negative psychological impact of the intoxicating social experiment?—Nick Riganas Teachers Martin, Tommy, Peter and Nikolaj are colleagues and friends at a gymnasium in Copenhagen. All four struggle with unmotivated students and feel that their lives have become boring and stale. At a dinner celebrating Nikolaj's 40th birthday, the group begins to discuss psychiatrist Finn Skårderud, who has theorized that having a blood alcohol content (BAC) of 0.0005 (0.5 per thousand) makes you more creative and relaxed. While the group dismisses the theory, Martin, who is depressed due to troubles in his marriage, is inspired and starts to drink at work. The rest of the group eventually decides to join in, considering the ordeal an experiment to test Skårderud's theory. They agree to a set of rules: their BAC should never be below 0.0005 and that they should not drink after 8:00pm.Within a short period of time, all four members of the group find both their work and private lives more enjoyable. Martin, in particular, is delighted as he finally manages to reconnect with his wife and children. Agreeing that the experiment should be taken further, the group increases the daily BAC limit to 0.001 (1/1000 or 1 per thousand). Still finding their lives improved, the group decides to attempt binge drinking to observe how their bodies and minds respond. The group has a fun night, but after coming home drunk, both Martin and Nikolaj are confronted by their families. Martin's family express their worries that he is descending into alcoholism, revealing that he has been visibly drunk for weeks. After a heated argument, during which Martin's wife admits to infidelity, Martin leaves her. The group abandons the experiment.Months later, all the members of the group have stopped drinking during the day with the exception of Tommy, who has become an alcoholic. A few days after arriving to work drunk, Tommy boards his boat with his dog and sails out on the ocean and dies. The three remaining members of the group go out to dinner after Tommy's funeral and appear reluctant to drink the alcohol which is served. While dining, Martin receives a message from his wife who states that she is willing to give their marriage a new chance while the recently graduated students drive by. Martin, Peter and Nikolaj join them in celebrating and drinking at the harbour. Martin, a former jazz ballet dancer, dances with the rest of the partygoers, which he had refused up to this point in the film despite his colleagues' repeated instigations. His dance becomes increasingly frenetic and the story ends as he jumps in the ocean head first, the frame freezed while Martin is in the air."

Enola Holmes,2020,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7846844/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"When Enola Holmes (Sherlock's teen sister) discovers her mother is missing, she endeavours to find her, becoming a super-sleuth in her own right as she outwits her famous brother and unravels a dangerous conspiracy. England, 1884 - a world on the brink of change. On the morning of her 16th birthday, Enola Holmes (Millie Bobby Brown) wakes to find that her mother (Helena Bonham Carter) has disappeared, leaving behind an odd assortment of gifts but no apparent clue as to where she's gone or why. After a free-spirited childhood, Enola suddenly finds herself under the care of her brothers Sherlock (Henry Cavill) and Mycroft (Sam Claflin), both set on sending her away to a finishing school for ""proper"" young ladies. Refusing to follow their wishes, Enola escapes to search for her mother in London. But when her journey finds her entangled in a mystery surrounding a young runaway Lord (Louis Partridge), Enola becomes a super-sleuth in her own right, outwitting her famous brother as she unravels a conspiracy that threatens to set back the course of history.—Netflix On the dawn of her 16th birthday, Sherlock Holmes' little sister Enola Holmes finds out that her beloved mother has mysteriously disappeared without telling her. While traveling to London for further answers, Enola not only must locate her missing mother, but she must work to uncover the mystery that involves the runaway of a wealthy family. Little does Enola know is that her older brothers--Sherlock and Mycroft are hot on her tail and have intentions to send her back to school.—Blazer346 As the film opens, Enola Holmes rides her bicycle and narrates to the audience. She explains that her mother Eudoria, keen on word games, insisted on naming her Enola (a reverse of the word Alone) after her birth, and that following the early death of her father and subsequent departure of her elder brothers, Mycroft and Sherlock, her mother raised and educated her in their country home of Ferndell Hall. Eudoria raised Enola on many books, sciences, and sports, and encouraged a free and playful lifestyle, unlike the stuffy and traditional schools and expectations of Victorian England. Despite this usual closeness, Enola once accidentally interrupted a secret meeting between her mother and a group of other women, who hid their intentions from her. She goes on to explain that on the morning of her sixteenth birthday, Enola awoke to find her mother missing, leaving only a wooden gift box with a booklet on flowers, cards, and pencils as a birthday present passed on to her by their housekeeper, Mrs. Lane. Back in the present, Enola tells the audience that a week has passed since Eudoria's disappearance, and she is on the way to the train station to receive Mycroft, now a rich aristocrat working for the government, and Sherlock, now the famous detective. Upon their arrival, her brothers fail to recognize her at first, having not seen her since she was small. Mycroft is horrified that Enola is out in public without a hat or gloves, and dirty from having fallen off her bike on the way to the station. He is further annoyed to find that Enola has not brought the carriage he has been paying for, confusing Enola as they do not own a carriage. Sherlock hires one to take them to Ferndell, and upon their arrival, Mycroft balks at the state of the house. He tells Sherlock that he has been sending a great deal of money to Eudoria, who sent letters to him detailing the costs of the household, including rooms, members of household staff, and teachers for Enola, which do not exist. Sherlock investigates, and surmises that although Eudoria's absence is not foul play, she does not intend to return. Mycroft and Sherlock discuss what to do with their younger sister now that Eudoria is gone. Mycroft feels that Eudoria has robbed him, and saddled him with Enola. Sherlock thinks Enola should be allowed to stay at Ferndell, as Eudoria educated her on virtually every subject herself, and she seems to be very clever. However, Mycroft insists on sending her away to a strict boarding school so she may be turned into a proper lady, citing that she is his ward now, and Sherlock has shown little interest in the family. Mycroft sends for Miss Harrison of Miss Harrison's Finishing School for Young Ladies, and Enola's free spirit and defiant attitude gains her a slap from the headmistress. Enola begs not to be sent away, but Mycroft is adamant, and Sherlock refuses to help. That evening, Sherlock finds Enola sketching and recounts the only memories he has of her, including a pine cone wrapped in wool she called Dash, after one of Queen Victoria's dogs. Enola chastises Sherlock for never visiting or writing home, telling him she has followed every one of his cases. Sherlock sees Eudoria's vanishing as an interesting mystery to be solved, and tells Enola to look for what's already in front of her. That night, Enola finds a secret coded message from her mother in the gift box she left. She decodes it and follows the clues in her booklet to a hidden envelope filled with money addressed to her, with the only note saying: ""Our future is up to us.""
Enola decides to run away to search for her mother, dressing as a boy and boarding a train bound for London. A rich family is at the station, frantically looking for someone. Enola notices a latecomer on the train wearing a brown bowler hat who gives a signal to someone on the platform. The train leaves and is well on it's way when a boy Enola's age pops out of a large travel bag in her compartment. Enola deduces that this is the boy the family at the station was looking for, and he introduces himself has the Viscount Tewkesbury, Marquis of Basilweather, and says that he is running away. Enola tells him of the man in the bowler hat who she has also deduced has been sent to look for him. Sure enough, the Bowler Hat man is approaching their carriage, and Enola leaves, not wanting to get involved, as the man passes her and finds Tewkesbury. She hears the boy scream, and returns to find the man holding him outside the train door, about to smash him into a tunnel wall. Enola attacks the man, Linthorn, and saves Tewkesbury, jumping off the train just before a bridge to strand the attempted murderer.Sherlock and Mycroft discover Enola has run off, angering Mycroft. Mrs. Lane tells Sherlock that Enola knows nothing of the outside world in practicality, and asks him not to abandon her a second time.
Enola and Tewkesbury begin to walk across the countryside toward London, stopping to rest at dark, where Tewkesbury reveals his vast knowledge of plants, flowers, and edible fungi to forage for food. Enola cuts his long hair short to help him not be recognized, as he explains that, after narrowly avoiding being crushed by a falling tree branch, he realized that he didn't want to join the army like his uncle as his family wants him to, or take his seat in the House of Lords like his deceased father. Enola tells him in turn of her decision to run away rather than be sent to Miss Harrison's. Tewkesbury proposes they stick together in London, but Enola refuses, and they go their separate ways upon reaching the city. Using the money Eudoria left for her, Enola disguises herself as a well-bred lady, and finds a boarding house to stay at. Meanwhile, Sherlock and Mycroft return to London. Mycroft has the police on the lookout for Enola, and Sherlock has turned down the Tewkesbury case in favor of searching for her and Eudoria himself. Mycroft is insistent that their name be kept out of it, not wanting to be embarrassed by Enola, and complains about an upcoming vote to reform voter rights by the House of Lords, which is at a deadlock.
Enola leaves a coded message in various newspapers for her mother, finding that the Viscount Tewkesbury's disappearance has gotten a lot of press. She then tracks down the correspondent her mother often wrote to, Ethel, who runs Jiu-Jitsu classes for women above her tea shop and used to teach Enola self defense. She tells Enola that Eudoria does not want to be found and has secret work to do in London, and Enola remembers her as one of the women at Eudoria's secret meeting. Enola finds fireworks in Ethel's office after she returns to her students, and recalls hearing coded words in their conversation at the meeting. Decoding them as locations, she surmises that they are hiding something at the docks, and goes to investigate. Once there, Enola finds a warehouse bearing a purple ribbon, the same ribbon as was on her birthday gift from her mother. Sneaking in, she finds great quantities of fireworks, gunpowder, and other explosives. She also finds posters for suffragette rallies, and is horrified to find full fledged bombs hidden away. She questions weather she should continue her attempts to find her mother, as it seems she is involved in dangerous activities. As she goes to leave the docks, Enola is ambushed by Linthorn, who interrogates her about Tewkesbury's location and attempts to drown her in a water trough. She outsmarts him, momentarily getting away, and explains to the audience how he mother taught her various subjects, including physical combat. An intense fight between her and Linthorn ensues, with Enola eventually being overpowered by Linthorn's superior strength. He throws her through the warehouse door and attempts to finish the job and stab her, though she is protected by her whalebone corset. She sets off the gunpowder in the room and escapes Linthorn.
While nursing her wounds, Enola tells the audience of how she once almost died trying to save a sheep, and her mother's advice not to risk her life to help others. However, Enola decides she cannot leave Tewkesbury to his fate, and resolves to find and help him.Enola once again disguises herself, this time as a widow named May Beatrice Poesy, in order to gain a meeting with Lady Tewkesbury, the marquis' mother, at Basilweather Hall. Tewkesbury's Mother, Uncle, and Grandmother are all skeptical of Enola's claim of being a lady detective, until she says she works for Sherlock Holmes as an advance investigator. This piques their interest, though Inspector Lestrade of Scotland Yard enters and says that Sherlock always works alone. Tewkesbury's Uncle, Sir Whimbrel, sends them both away, stating that they do not need more help. Enola and Lestrade test each other on their knowledge of Sherlock, finding themselves equal. Lestrade leaves, confused by 'May'. Enola pays a gardener for his uniform, and is pointed towards the woods as the place where Tewkesbury spent most of his time.
Lestrade meets with Mycroft and tells him of 'May Beatrice Poesy' who matches the description of Enola. Mycroft confirms she is his sister, and tells Lestrade to find her.
In the forest, Enola finds the tree branch that almost killed Tewkesbury, and discovers saw marks on it's base. She also investigates his hidden tree house, where he laid his plans, and indicated fake locations on a map of London so as to send his pursuers in the wrong direction, including (coincidentally), the docks where Linthorn jumped Enola. She finds flower pressings in a travel book, and theorizes where the marquis is actually hiding. She is surprised by Tewkesbury's grandmother, the Dowager, who speaks with 'May' regarding the boy's disappearance, and tells her about his father. She says he was a ""new thinker"", and young Tewkesbury is likely the same. She tells 'May' to send her love to her grandson should she see him before she does, and lets her leave without trouble for snooping.Sherlock follows clues from Ferndell to Edith's tea shop, and asks to speak with her, bargaining for her time with the leverage of her banned books she lets her customers read. He inquires as to Eudoria's whereabouts, saying she needs to return to take care of Enola. Edith tells him Eudoria is doing good work to change the world, and Enola seems to be taking care of herself. Edith also tells him of the ""useless boy"" Enola ran into, and that she is also looking for Eudoria. She admits she is pleased that Sherlock is at least taking an interest, as Eudoria figured he would always ignore his younger sister. She says that Enola needs Sherlock, and advises him to find and help her.
Later, Enola arrives at Covent Garden Market, where she tracks down Tewkesbury selling flowers among the crowded stalls. He is pleased, if surprised, to see her again, and asks why she went through the trouble of finding him, thinking she might turn him in for the reward money being offered. She tells him that she is actually there because his life is still in danger, and they both confess to having missed each other since their departure. Enola takes him back to her lodgings house, where Tewkesbury finds a pile of newspapers. Enola explains how her mother left her, and she is waiting for a response to the message she sent her. They bond over both having lost their fathers, and how the rest of the people in their lives don't seem to want them. Enola tells Tewkesbury that despite his family being wealthy enough to send a detective to find him, someone in his family sent a murderer instead. Enola says that she is sure his father was actually murdered, and that whoever did it must want him dead for the same reason. She also informs him of her findings at Basilweather, and that the branch that nearly killed him had been intentionally cut. Lestrade ambushes them, but Enola notices him and counters. They manage to make it to Enola's room, but struggle to keep the door closed. Enola tells Tewkesbury to go out the window and disappear, as his life will be in jeopardy if he is caught, and there is not enough time for them both to escape. Tewkesbury argues, but Enola orders him to go, holding the door just long enough for him to get away, and is caught by Lestrade . She is turned over to Mycroft, who confiscates the money her mother gave her, and takes her to Miss Harrison's Finishing School for Young Ladies. She is kept locked in her room in between lessons, and tries to remain defiant of the headmistress, though her spirits begin to dwindle.
Later, Enola is told that her brother has come to visit her, and she is relieved to see that it is Sherlock. She checks his newspaper for a possible message, and is angry about her situation. Sherlock encourages her to take the lessons to heart, as they may come in handy in future cases. She asks him about Eudoria, and he says he has tracked her trail (albeit by following separate clues) and found the docks one step behind Enola's confrontation with Linthorn, and they discuss the bombs found there. She accuses him of helping Mycroft catch her, and seeing her only as a case, which he denies, and admits that he came because he cares about her. He asks her about the Tewkesbury case, having deduced that she was with the boy on the train. He is impressed with her detective work, he asks if she has solved the mystery yet. He gives her some advice, detective to detective, and also gives her Dash, the pine cone dog, having found it among Eudoria's things, telling Enola that he and Eudoria both find her extraordinary.
After Sherlock leaves, Enola looks through the paper, and finds that the Reform Bill is still tied in the House of Lords, and another article about the still missing marquis. Just then a large basket is delivered to Enola, supposedly from Mycroft, but is revealed to be Tewkesbury, having smuggled himself in. Enola is overjoyed to see him, and is relieved that he is alright. He intends to get her out the same way he came in, but Enola alters the plan to get around Miss Harrison's watchful eye. Tewkesbury delivers the basket with Enola inside to Miss Harrison, telling her it's from Mycroft (who she is sweet on), and Enola escapes while Miss Harrison sends the lad away. They steal her motorcar, and Enola tells Tewkesbury that he is being targeted to prevent him from taking his seat in the House of Lords and voting yes on the Reform Bill, and that his uncle (who would inherit the seat and vote no) has the most to gain by killing both his father and him.
Inspired by Sherlock's advice, Enola decides to go to Basilweather and confront Sir Whimbrel. They enter, but find the house dark and deserted, and are trapped inside by Linthorn, who was waiting for them and is wielding a shotgun. Enola and the marquis hide in the shadows, and narrowly avoid being shot. Enola jumps the gunman, but is rendered unconscious. Before Linthorn can kill her, Tewkesbury attacks him, knocking his gun away, but is also subdued. Linthorn begins to strangle Tewkesbury as Enola struggles to regain consciousness. She manages to grapple Linthorn, knocking him headfirst into a sharp fixture, killing him. The Dowager enters, and Tewkesbury is heartbroken to discover that it was she who hired Linthorn to kill him and his father. She picks up the shotgun, telling her grandson that she had to prevent him from voting on the Reform Bill. She tells him that she sent his mother and uncle back to London to look for him, and explains that the future of the country depends on his death. She shoots Tewkesbury in the chest in cold blood, seemingly killing him. Enola disarms the Dowager, and mourns over Tewkesbury. However, Tewkesbury wakes up, having only been knocked out from the impact, and reveals that he hid a steel chest plate from one of the suits of armor under his jacket, protecting him from the shot. He rises and tells the Dowager her time is over.Sherlock arrives at Scotland Yard and tells Lestrade to arrest the Dowager, as she is trying to kill the marquis, and had his father murdered. He explains that Sir Whimbrel was away at war and couldn't have done it, but that the Dowager wanted him to stand against the Reform Bill and any other such changes, as the Viscount and his father before him would have voted in favor. Lestrade reveals that Enola has actually solved the case first, impressing Sherlock. Tewkesbury reunites with his mother and uncle, and takes his seat in the House of Lords. Enola sees him off at the gate. They share an emotional farewell, but promise to see each other again soon, and Tewkesbury prepares himself for the final Reform Bill vote.
Enola discovers a coded message for her in the paper asking to rendezvous, but upon decoding it, surmises that Sherlock, not Eudoria, has sent it. She disguises herself and goes anyway. Sherlock is indeed waiting for her, but Mycroft says she's outsmarted him. Sherlock offers to take Enola in as his ward once they find her, which Mycroft agrees to, annoyed that with Tewkesbury's vote, the Reform Bill has passed. As they leave, Sherlock notices Dash, but doesn't see Enola, and we see her watch them as they go. She returns to her new boarding house to find her mother waiting for her. Eudoria explains that she wanted to tell Enola where she went, but that it isn't safe and she can't stay too long. She is proud of Enola for saving the marquis, and they briefly reunite before Eudoria leaves again, telling Enola to send her a message if she ever needs help.
Enola tells the audience she will have to follow her own path, and that it's time she found her place in the world as a detective, saying that ""Our future is up to us""."

They endeavour desperately to get on a last-minute flight to a possible safe haven.—youssefsaiid John Garrity is a Scottish structural engineer living in Atlanta, Georgia, with his estranged wife, Allison, and their diabetic son, Nathan. He returns home from work to reconcile with his family and prepare to host a party with their neighbors to watch the passing of a recently-discovered interstellar comet, named Clarke.Arriving at a grocery store, John and Nathan notice a fleet of military cargo transport jets flying north in formation, much to their bewilderment. In the store, John receives a strange automated phone call, informing him that he and his family have been pre-selected for emergency sheltering. Worried by this, John rushes home to the party, just as a comet fragment enters the atmosphere on live television. A shock wave rattles the area and blows out windows as the fragment, previously anticipated to land near Bermuda, vaporizes Tampa, Florida, and most of the state around it. John once again receives an automated call, which also displays on the television in front of his family and neighbors with instructions to be at Robins Air Force Base to make an evacuation flight. Terrified, their neighbors storm out of the house to be close with their families while the Garritys rush to pack up and leave. Before they can, their neighbor, Ed, warns them that Clarke is actually a giant cluster of objects that are expected to bombard Earth over the next two days, with the biggest fragment expected to cause an extinction level event. Debra, another one of their neighbors, desperately begs to leave their daughter Ellie with the Garritys to be saved, but John speeds off, knowing she would be turned away.At Robins, a line of traffic prevents the family from reaching the gate and forces them to continue on foot, with Nathan accidentally leaving his insulin in the car. They are allowed in with the QR code on John's phone and their wristbands. When forced to consolidate their belongings into one bag, they also discover that Nathan's insulin is missing. John hurries back to the car to find it while Allison and Nathan wait to board the plane, who are escorted away once a soldier learns of Nathan's ailment. Allison begs for them to be let on the plane, but is unsuccessful, and the two are escorted off the base. Oblivious to this, John makes it back to the plane in time, where another passenger confronts him about the medicine and learns that his family was turned away, too. John demands to be let off the plane just as the base is breached by an angry mob wanting to be saved. A gunfight breaks out, inadvertently blowing up many of the evacuation planes and killing dozens while John narrowly escapes.Upon returning to their car, he finds a note left by Allison that she and Nathan are heading to her father's house in Lexington, Kentucky. After narrowly escaping a store being looted, Allison and Nathan are picked up by couple Ralph and Judy Vento, who are also headed that way. Ralph tells them they will take them as far as Knoxville, Tennessee. Meanwhile, John is walking on foot through a small city, where looting is taking place in masses as worldwide panic ensues as an approaching Clarke looms ominously in the night sky. He comes across a rooftop party and attempts to call Allison. He briefly gets through to her before the call is dropped.Through conversation, Ralph and Judy find out that Allison and Nathan were selected for evacuation but denied entry. Ralph pulls over to kick Allison out, as well as take her wristband and kidnap Nathan, much to Judy's protest. John manages to hitch a ride on a truck with other survivors, where he learns through a young man named Colin that the military is flying to bunkers in Greenland for refuge. Another survivor, noticing John's wristband and believing only American-born citizens should have been selected, attempts to fight him for it. The ensuing chaos results in the truck nearly crashing, which kills Colin, and the hostile man is gruesomely killed by John. Meanwhile, Ralph, Judy, and a frightened Nathan later arrive at a FEMA camp where they attempt to pass as Nathan's parents to guarantee their safety as well, but they are detained when Nathan tells a soldier that he was kidnapped. Allison eventually ends up at the same camp, where a man helps her look for Nathan, and the two are reunited.The following day, John wanders through an empty neighborhood and breaks into a house to find food and water. He turns on a TV to see various news channels reporting the worldwide destruction and a countdown to the final impact. He steals a car and finally reaches the home of his father-in-law, Dale, but realizes that his family is not there. Allison and Nathan soon get off at a small shop nearby and call the house, and are picked up by John and Dale. They return to his house, defeated and accepting their fate to die in the impact in less than a day. However, recalling some information from Colin, John realizes they might have enough time to make a last-minute flight in Canada to reach the bunkers. The family agrees to leave, saying goodbye to Dale before continuing in his truck.They reach Upstate New York when an emergency alert warns them of molten debris threatening the region. Small fireballs rain from the sky, destroying cars, people, and downing a helicopter as people scramble to escape. John manages to drive them to an underpass for refuge, and after some time, the meteor shower ceases, leaving much of the area on fire, but allowing the family to continue to Canada as it is revealed that Clarke's largest fragment will make impact somewhere in Western Europe. John drives onto the runway as the plane is about to take off, and an angered pilot confronts the family. He argues that the plane is full and cannot take any more passengers but later agrees to take only Nathan and Allison, with the latter eventually convincing the pilot to take all of them.The plane approaches Greenland, however, another fragment strikes off the coast, and the subsequent shock wave causes the plane to crash land into a valley, killing the pilots. After John leads his family and the survivors to the nearby airbase, the group embrace as Clarke enters the atmosphere and impacts. Nine months later, the Greenland base attempts to make radio contact with other potential survivors as various cities (Sydney, Paris, Mexico City, and Chicago) are shown in total ruin. The bunker doors open, allowing the Garritys and other survivors to step outside for the first time to see a radically changed landscape. The crowds cheer with joy upon seeing a pair of birds flying around as they exit the base. An orbital view reveals a massive crater where Clarke impacted and several smaller craters dotting the planet's surface reminiscent of the Moon as Greenland finally makes contact with other stations around the globe, who each are relieved to hear each other and report that the atmosphere is finally clearing."

Greyhound,2020,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6048922/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Several months after the U.S. entry into World War II, an inexperienced U.S. Navy commander must lead an Allied convoy being stalked by a German submarine wolf pack. Based upon the novel ""The Good Shepherd"" by C S Forester, this is the thrilling story of an Allied convoy crossing the North Atlantic in 1942 as it faces relentless attack by a German submarine wolf pack. The leader of the convoy's destroyer screen is a US Navy commander making his first Atlantic crossing. The story focuses on his command responsibility as he fights the cold, the relentless night, the brutal sea, and his deep fatigue as he chases down the attacking submarines in the deadly game of cat and mouse. The exciting story, a thrilling ride-along with the beleaguered captain, so deeply portrays the elements of battle command that for a long period of time the book was used as a text at the US Naval Academy.—Nlappos A first-time captain leads the escort contingent of a convoy of Allied ships carrying thousands of soldiers and tons of supplies across the treacherous waters of the ""Black Pit"" to Great Britain. With no air cover protection for four days, the commander and his convoy must battle the surrounding enemy submarines in order to help the Allies win the war.—yusufpiskin February 1942. The destroyer USS Greyhound, captained by Commander Krause, is the leader of the escort of a large Atlantic convoy. For 50 hours they will have no air cover, making them vulnerable to U-Boat attack. A few hours in their worst fears are realised: the convoy has been targeted by a U-Boat wolfpack.—grantss During the early days of U.S. involvement in World War II, an international convoy of 37 multinational Allied merchant ships, crammed with goods and provisions, crossed the freezing waters of the Atlantic Ocean while being chased by stealthy German U-boats. Commander-in-Chief Ernest Krause, a career officer and captain of the Fletcher-class destroyer USS Keeling, code-named Greyhound, is assigned to lead the vulnerable Allied convoy across the dangerous Mid-Atlantic gap known as the ""Black Pit"". But, to bring the ships to safe waters, Krause, making his first Atlantic crossing, will have to face his inner demons and doubts in what would come to be known as the most prolonged and most complex military campaign in the Naval history of World War II: The Battle of the Atlantic.—Nick Riganas During the Battle of the Atlantic, convoy HX-25, consisting of 37 Allied ships, is making its way to Liverpool. The convoy's escort consists of the Fletcher-class destroyer USS Keeling, radio call sign ""Greyhound"", captained by Commander Ernest Krause (Tom Hanks) of the United States Navy; the British Tribal-class destroyer HMS James, call sign ""Harry""; the Polish Grom-class destroyer ORP Viktor (with a Royal Navy liaison officer on the radio), call sign ""Eagle""; and the Canadian Flower-class corvette, HMCS Dodge, call sign ""Dicky"". Krause is serving as overall commander of the escort ships, but despite his seniority and extensive naval education, it is his first wartime command.The convoy enters the ""Black Pit"" - the Mid-Atlantic gap where they will be out of range of protective air cover. While they are still three days away from the resumption of air cover, high-frequency direction finding from the convoy flagship results in the interception of several German transmissions, indicating the presence of U-boats. Greyhound's radar operator identifies a surfaced sub heading towards the convoy. Greyhound moves away from the convoy to intercept it based on its bearing and gets the U-boat within firing range, but the heavy seas allow the U-boat to dive before Greyhound can get a visual. After sonar contact is re-established, the submarine tries to slip under Greyhound, but Krause maneuvers his ship above the U-boat and fires a full pattern of depth charges, resulting in his first kill.The crew's jubilation is cut short as they soon receive reports of distress rockets at the rear of the convoy. A Greek merchant ship was attacked by another U-boat and is quickly sinking. Krause moves Greyhound to assist, evading torpedoes fired at his ship with careful maneuvering. The surviving Greek sailors are rescued, and Greyhound returns to the convoy just as the bridge receives multiple messages from the other escorts: a wolf-pack consisting of six U-boats is staying just out of firing range of the convoy; Krause suspects they are waiting for nightfall, when the escorts will have no visibility. The attack commences that evening with five merchant ships being torpedoed and sunk. One U-boat torpedoes an oil tanker and escapes Greyhound by using an underwater decoy, tricking the crew into wasting most of their remaining depth charges. Krause chooses to rescue survivors from the burning oil tanker rather than go to the aid of the other ships first, a decision he comes to regret.The next day, the wolf pack targets Greyhound. The captain of the lead submarine, call-sign ""Grey Wolf"", taunts the convoy and its escorts via radio transmission, threatening to sink them all. Krause learns that Greyhound is down to six depth charges, leaving it with no effective response to an underwater attack. The U-boats launch multiple torpedo runs, which Greyhound is barely able to evade. Greyhound and Dicky combine to sink one of the U-boats in an exchange of surface broadsides. Dicky receives minor damage due to the close range of the engagement and Greyhound is hit on the port side by one of the U-boat's deck guns, which kills Krause's mess attendant, George Cleveland, and two sailors. During the funeral service, Eagle is attacked and eventually sinks. Krause, aware that doing so might expose the shoddy state of the escort fleet, elects to break radio silence by transmitting a single word, ""help"", to the Admiralty.With the convoy close to reaching air cover, the remaining U-boats mount an all-out assault on the destroyers. One of the torpedoes glances off the side of Greyhound, and the other barely makes contact. After heavy fighting, Greyhound sinks Grey Wolf with a full broadside. To everyone's relief, they spot air support deployed from British RAF Coastal Command and use their guns to mark the last visible U-boat, allowing a PBY Catalina bomber to line up a depth charge attack and sink the sub. The rest of the pack quickly flees before they can be discovered.While assessing damage, Krause receives radio contact from the head of the relief escorts, HMS Diamond, that his relief has arrived and Greyhound is due for repair and refitting in Derry alongside his two surviving companion vessels. The crew receives a ""job well done"" on their four U-boat kills. As Krause turns over command to a junior officer, all present on the bridge gaze at their Captain with new-found respect. While setting the new course, passengers and crew of the remaining convoy ships cheer and send up flares to salute Greyhound's crew for their valor and victory at sea while Krause finally prays and rests."

Discovering that the gun Owen used to kill himself is gone, Claire rushes out to the dock with Mel where they find Beth floating out in the boat with the gun.

The Old Guard,2020,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7556122/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A covert team of immortal mercenaries is suddenly exposed and must now fight to keep their identity a secret just as an unexpected new member is discovered. Led by a warrior named Andy (Charlize Theron), a covert group of tight-knit mercenaries with a mysterious inability to die have fought to protect the mortal world for centuries. But when the team is recruited to take on an emergency mission and their extraordinary abilities are suddenly exposed, it's up to Andy and Nile (Kiki Layne), the newest soldier to join the ranks, to help the group eliminate the threat of those who seek to replicate and monetize their power by any means necessary.—Netflix Andromache of Scythia (""Andy"") (Charlize Theron), Booker (Matthias Schoenaerts), Joe (Marwan Kenzari), and Nicky (Luca Marinelli) are centuries-old warriors with unexplained regenerative healing abilities who use their vast experience to work as mercenaries, taking missions that help people. Breaking their rule of never working for the same employers twice, they accept a job from former CIA operative James Copley (Chiwetel Ejiofor) to rescue a group of kidnapped girls in South Sudan. Copley convinces Andy and Booker that the girls will be moved quickly by the kidnappers, and if they are they will never be found again.During the mission, which proves to be a ruse (as there were no hostages), they are ambushed and killed. After quickly recovering and killing their attackers, they realize that Copley set them up and remotely filmed their regeneration. Andy is now worried that the CIA knows about her team's regenerative abilities. She decides to kill Copley.Meanwhile, in Afghanistan, U.S. Marine Nile Freeman (KiKi Layne) has her throat slit while taking down a military target during a house search, only to recover without a scratch. Later, she shares a disturbing dream with the other immortals, who are then alerted to her existence, as they experience dreams of any new immortals until found. Andy is also perplexed as this is the first immortal find in over 200 years. Andy goes to extract Nile, while her team goes to a safe-house in France to track down Copley.Andy tracks down a confused Nile and extracts her from Afghanistan before military personnel can transfer her for further testing.
Copley shows the video of the ambush to pharmaceutical executive Steven Merrick (Harry Melling), who sends operatives (led by Keane (Joey Ansah)) to capture the team. Dr Meta Kozak (Anamaria Marinca) is Merrick's head of research and wants to get her hands on a DNA sample to figure out how the immortals work.Andy brings Nile to a safe house in France (after Nile makes several attempts to escape, but finally accepts that Andy means no harm to her), where she meets the rest of their team. The group shares some of their past and reveal that they are not truly immortal: their ability to heal eventually stops, without warning, which happened to a previous immortal, Lykon. She is also told about the female immortal Quynh (Ngô Thanh Vân), the first of Andy's comrades, who was captured, accused of witchcraft, and lost to them when cast somewhere into the sea in an iron maiden, and has been continually drowning ever since for over 500 yrs now. The group searched for Quynh, but could never find her location.The group is ambushed by Merrick's forces; Joe and Nicky are captured (and taken by Copley to Merrick in a private jet) while a seemingly deceased Booker is left behind. While Booker regenerates, Andy kills all of their assailants but is wounded and realizes she is not healing.
Booker locates Copley and Andy mounts an attack, while Nile separates from the group to reunite with her family (she says that she never had a choice in joining the immortals and cannot identify with them. Plus she wants to spend time with her family before they pass on).
Andy and Booker confront Copley, only for Booker to betray Andy and shoot her, arguing that Merrick might find a way to end the immortality they have both grown weary of. As they are captured, however, Booker realizes that Andy is not healing. Copley has a change of heart when he sees that Merrick is willing to torture the immortals indefinitely to study them. Plus Merrick wants exclusivity on immortal DNA and thus will never release them back into the world.
Nile, having realized Booker sold out the group (when she checks her gun, it was without any bullets and she knows that the guns were handed by Booker), arrives too late to intervene, but she convinces Copley to assist her in a rescue mission. Copley says that he sold the immortals out due to her own wife's demise due to cancer. He thought he was giving a gift to the world by ending suffering.She storms Merrick's London office and after she frees the rest of the immortals, they fight their way out through the rest of Merrick's security (the whole team protects Andy and doesn't let any bullet get to her), with Nile saving Andy from Merrick by grabbing him and jumping out of a window, killing him.
As punishment for his betrayal, the group sentence Booker to loneliness - forbidding Booker from contacting them for 100 years. The rest of the group meets with Copley, who explains how his research revealed their past missions had a greater effect than they ever knew, with the descendants of people they had rescued going on to help the world in many different ways. With renewed faith in their existence, the group tasks Copley with maintaining their secret and finding missions where they can have an effect.
Six months later in Paris, a depressed and drunken Booker is astonished to find Quynh in his apartment."

While stuck at a wedding in Palm Springs, Nyles (Andy Samberg) meets Sarah (Cristin Milioti), the maid of honor and family black sheep. After he rescues her from a disastrous toast, Sarah becomes drawn to Nyles and his offbeat nihilism. But when their impromptu tryst is thwarted by a surreal interruption, Sarah must join Nyles in embracing the idea that nothing really matters, and they begin wreaking spirited havoc on the wedding celebration. Trapped in a perpetual time loop, Nyles has been living the same day over and over again for a very long time. Against the backdrop of sunny Palm Springs, Nyles must wake up with a woman he doesn't much like, relive the wedding day of Tala and Abe, and prevent gloomy Sarah, the bride's chronically bored sister, from making a humbling, booze-addled mistake. However, how do you spend eternity reliving a day you would rather forget?—Nick Riganas On November 9, Nyles wakes up next to his girlfriend Misty on the wedding day of Tala and Abe. At the reception, he delivers a seemingly impromptu speech, to the relief of Tala's sister, the drunk and unprepared maid-of-honor Sarah. Nyles and Sarah bond and, after discovering Misty cheating on Nyles, are about to have sex when Nyles is abruptly shot in the shoulder with an arrow by an older man named Roy. Wounded, he crawls toward a mysterious amber light in a nearby cave, warning Sarah not to follow. Sarah, curious, is sucked into a vortex in the cave.Sarah wakes up, again, on November 9. After she confronts Nyles, he explains that she has become stuck in the same time loop as him. Sarah unsuccessfully attempts many escape methods, such as driving back to her hometown or suicide. Nyles and Sarah spend many days together, often relaxing in the pool of a nearby home whose occupants are away on vacation. Nyles reveals that Roy is a family man who lives in Irvine, whom Nyles also trapped in the time loop.

The next day, it is revealed that Sarah has been waking up in Abe's room having spent the nights of November 8 with him, and he advises her to leave before she's seen. A guilt-ridden Sarah refuses to talk to Nyles about their previous night, expressing that everything they do is meaningless. They are pulled over by a police officer, who turns out to be Roy.

I'm Thinking of Ending Things,2020,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7939766/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Full of misgivings, a young woman travels with her new boyfriend to his parents' secluded farm. Upon arriving, she comes to question everything she thought she knew about him, and herself. Despite second thoughts about their relationship, a young woman (Jessie Buckley) takes a road trip with her new boyfriend (Jesse Plemons) to his family farm. Trapped at the farm during a snowstorm with Jake's mother (Toni Collette) and father (David Thewlis), the young woman begins to question the nature of everything she knew or understood about her boyfriend, herself, and the world. An exploration of regret, longing and the fragility of the human spirit, I'M THINKING OF ENDING THINGS is directed and written by Academy Award® winner Charlie Kaufman (Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind). Inspired by Iain Reid's bestselling namesake novel.—Netflix The film opens with an inner monologue from a young woman. She anxiously explains how she is thinking of ending things, although she can't say long she has been thinking this or how the idea formed. She has been in a relationship with Jake for a month now, although she says it feels like it has been much longer.It is the middle of winter and Jake is taking her on a road trip out to a rural area for her to meet Jake's parents. As she waits on a street corner for Jake to pick her up, she expresses how she regrets not breaking things off before agreeing to this trip.During the car trip the young woman keeps finding herself drifting off into her own head in lengthy inner monologues as Jake tries to make small talk. They pass by a demolished house with a swing set in the front yard. The woman remarks how bizarre it is that a torn down home would have a brand new swing set in the front yard.As the trip progresses, the snowfall grows much heavier. The couple's conversations occasionally become deep and philosophical. Both characters seem very analytical and well educated about a wide variety of topics.There is a moment where Jake calls the young woman ""Lucy"". (She is called by several different names throughout the film.)Jake turns on the radio and sings along to a song from the musical ""Oklahoma!"". The young woman is surprised to discover he is a fan of musical theater.At one point the young woman reads a lengthy poem about the comfort of going home, and the existential terror of actually arriving. The poem features themes of loneliness, regret, and the fear of growing old. Jake remarks he feels as if the poem was written specifically about him.Occasionally the film cuts away to the daily routine of an elderly janitor. His backyard has the same swing set from the house. He is shown going to work at a high school. His life and job seem lonely and mundane. He watches students as they rehearse for a school production of ""Oklahoma!"".Eventually the couple arrives at Jake's parents' farmhouse. Jake refuses to go inside at first and instead insists that he first show her the stable. As they enter they find several dead sheep lying in the entrance. Jake avoids explaining how they died. He instead tells the story of a pig that died in the stable years ago. His father had neglected to check on the pigs for a few days and eventually found one of them was being eaten alive by maggots.They go inside and can't find either of Jake's parents at first. Eventually they are discovered to both still be upstairs getting ready.Jake gives the young woman a tour of the house. She mentions how the house reminds her of her own childhood home. She also finds a baby photo of Jake on the wall she seems to believe is a photo of her. Jake shows her the door to the basement which is covered in scratches and has been taped shut. Jake tells her it's unsafe to go down there and the scratches are all probably from the family dog.The parents soon come downstairs and they all sit down for dinner. The parents are friendly and welcoming, but exhibit some peculiar behavior. The young woman shows off some of her artwork to the parents who don't know what to make of any of it. She also tells the story of how she and Jake met at a trivia night, a story which features several inconsistencies. The father seems to take everything completely at face value and doesn't understand anything beyond its literal meaning. The mother has a habit of mispronouncing words and laughing hysterically until she seems to be in pain.During dinner, the young woman receives a voice mail from someone with the caller ID ""Lucy"". The caller delivers a cryptic message: ""There's only one question to resolve. I'm scared. I feel a little crazy. I'm not lucid. The assumptions are right. I can feel my fear growing. Now is the time for the answer. Just one question. One question to answer."" She doesn't seem to react to the message and casually carries on with the dinner conversation.Over dessert, the young woman talks about studying Gerontology and how she has always been fascinated by the aging process and upset with how society treats the elderly. Mid-conversation, Jake's mother is briefly overcome by a buzzing in her ears caused by tinnitus. She fearfully wonders aloud if the buzzing is someone trying to communicate with her to share the secrets of the universe.As the night goes on, more bizarre and unexplained things begin to happen. Jake's parents begin to rapidly age and de-age between scenes. The young woman goes up to Jake's childhood bedroom and finds it seemingly untouched from when he was a child. She finds a journal which somehow contains her own poem that she recited in the car earlier.Jake's father, who is at this point elderly and suffering from some form of dementia seems to misunderstand that Jake's girlfriend is there to stay the night. Despite her repeated attempts to explain she needs to be home tonight, the father offers her Jake's childhood bed to sleep in and the mother's old nightgown which has a large stain on it.Jake's mother asks young woman to go down to the basement to throw her stained nightgown in the wash. She goes to the basement and gets another mysterious call repeating the same message. She opens the running washing machine and finds inside an entire load of identical shirts. Down there, she also finds several paintings signed by Jake which seem to resemble her own.The young woman eventually convinces Jake to leave and they head back on the road. By this point the snowfall has become a blizzard. There's a moment where Jake calls the young woman Amy. She seems no longer able to remember much of what happened at the house after dinner.The conversation turns to the John Cassavetes film ""A Woman Under the Influence."" The young woman gives a lengthy, eloquent, and condescending critique of the film. She even seems to conjure a lit cigarette out of thin air to punctuate her suddenly very smug attitude. Jake says he connected with the film emotionally although he seems too ashamed now to try to articulate why.Jake suddenly suggests they pull over for ice cream. They stop at a place called ""Tulsey Town."" Two of the employees seem to recognize Jake, who is clearly embarrassed, refusing to make eye contact. The young woman seems to recognize the third employee, but can't recall from where. The girl, who has some sort of rash on her arms, cryptically tells Amy she doesn't have to go forward.Back on the road moments later, Jake decides he has had enough of his ice cream after barely touching it. The young woman suddenly decides she doesn't want any more either. Jake tries to search for somewhere to dispose of the ice cream before it melts inside the car.Jake pulls over at his old high school nearby. He disappears for a moment to throw the cups away and soon returns. They are about to leave when Jake spots the janitor watching them from inside. Jake gets out again and disappears into the building. The young woman waits for what seems to be a very long time, and Jake never returns. She gets out of the car and accidentally locks herself out.She goes into the school looking for Jake. She encounters the janitor and tries to hide from him at first. He soon finds her and she talks to him. She tells him that nothing ever happened between her and Jake that trivia night, and that she can't even remember what he looks like.The young woman and Jake soon find one another. Two dancers appear, dressed the same as them and a lengthy dream-like ballet sequence follows. The dance concludes with a third dancer, dressed as the janitor, appearing. A dance fight ensues which ends with the janitor killing Jake with a knife.The janitor finishes his shift. He goes out to his truck and is about to turn it on, but hesitates. He sits out in the cold and appears to suffer a mental breakdown. He hallucinates characters from a ""Tulsey Town"" commercial outside. He undresses and follows an animated pig back into the school. The pig resembles the one from Jake's story, with its underside infested with maggots.In the high school auditorium, a version of Jake, wearing stage makeup to look older, receives a Nobel Prize and delivers a speech about his journey through the metaphysical. Lucy/Amy is watching from the audience. She as well as most of the audience are made up to look older. Jake finishes his speech by singing the song ""Lonely Room"" from ""Oklahoma!"", a song about walking away from isolation and an imaginary girl, becoming stronger, and taking charge of your life.The film ends with a shot of the school parking lot the next morning. The snow storm has stopped and the janitor's truck is covered with snow. At the very end of the credits a sound of an engine beginning to turn over is heard. Perhaps suggesting Jake has changed his mind about ending things."

After Barb destroys his DJ station with her guitar's power, King Trollex is forced to surrender the string that powers Techno music.Poppy, still becoming adjusted to her new leadership as queen, receives a message from Barb that invites all Trolls to a party to unite their music. Her father reveals that there are different kinds of Trolls scattered through their land, each represented by a different style of music that is powered by a magical string kept by the leader of each tribe. Having split into their different forms of music following discord and disagreement over which was the best. Poppy wants to help Barb unite the different forms of music, but both her father and Branch warn her not to trust Barb's intentions and to accept that the other Trolls are different. Poppy does not listen, and sends a cheerful reply to Barb via Debbie, Barb's pet bat.Meanwhile, Barb gloats over her victory of snatching the Techno string, revealing her plan to string an enchanted guitar with all six strings, and play a power cord strong enough to destroy all other music, replacing it with rock.Wanting to prove herself as a good queen, Poppy travels via air balloon to recruit the other groups of Trolls, Branch joining her in an attempt to express his feelings towards her. Biggie accidentally stows aboard the balloon, and joins them. Meanwhile, Cooper, who feels like the black sheep among the Pop trolls, goes on a journey himself to find Trolls who look like him.The balloon ends up in the land of Classical Trolls, which, to Poppy's horror, has been decimated by Barb's armada, who captured all the citizens. A single small flute named Pennywhistle tells Poppy the truth about what happened, and Poppy decides to now unite the other Trolls to stop Barb. Branch and Biggie both urge her to return home to protect the Pop string, but Poppy reveals it hidden in her hair. They then travel to the Country Trolls' land, but after introducing themselves with a loud medley of pop songs, are jailed by an offended Delta Dawn. A Country Troll named Hickory, who claims he is moved by Poppy's motives, breaks them out, leading to a chase to a ravine, where the group falls into a river. Branch does not trust Hickory, even when the Troll builds a raft to take the group downstream. The conversation is interrupted by Chaz, a Smooth Jazz Troll who was hired as a bounty hunter to catch Poppy for Barb, who was incredibly offended by Poppy's reply letter. Hickory incapacitates Chaz, but Biggie, disillusioned by Poppy's poor leadership, decides to return home. Shortly after, the group is abducted by a space ship wielding magical soap bubbles.Inside the spaceship, the group meets the Funk Trolls, and meets up with Cooper, who is revealed to have been a long lost identical twin prince of Funk all along. Cooper tells Poppy he finds comfort in identifying with both Pop and Funk, and his parents, King Quincy and Queen Essence, reveal to Poppy that long ago the original Pop Trolls had attempted to steal the strings and remix the other five music styles into Pop, forcing the other Trolls to each take one string and divide their tribes to save their music. Quincy explains to Poppy that differences are not bad, and trying to make all Trolls the same does not help the problem.After the Rock Trolls hi-jack the Funk Trolls' ship, Cooper ejects the group in bubbles, accidentally separating Hickory from the two. Branch and Poppy fight when Poppy refuses to return home to their friends, and Branch admonishes her insisting she cannot be a good queen if she is a poor listener, and the two go their separate ways, heartbroken. Branch is soon captured by both K-Pop and Reggaeton bounty hunters. However, he eventually convinces them to so stop capturing and fighting and save Poppy and all music.Poppy reunites with Hickory, showing him the Pop string. Hickory tries to urge her to return home, but suddenly is revealed to have been a Yodel Troll all along. He and another Yodel Troll, Dickory, had been hired to capture her for Barb, but Hickory had a change of heart. Before she can escape, Poppy is then captured personally by Barb, who takes possession of the sixth and final string.Biggie returns home and seeing it in shambles, feels remorse over abandoning Poppy. He gathers together their remaining friends to go rescue her and Branch, entering the land of the Rock Trolls.Barb has Poppy imprisoned over a large concert stage where all the captured Trolls are the audience, and admits she empathizes with Poppy's attempts to be a good queen, as she is trying to make rock supreme to prove her own leadership. Barb uses her enchanted guitar during the concert to turn Branch, and the leaders of the other lands into rock zombies. Poppy seemingly is transformed into a rock zombie when she falls onto the stage, but upon grabbing Barb's guitar, it is revealed to have been wearing gumdrop earplugs. She admonishes Barb for being a poor queen by not taking time to listen to her people, and smashes the guitar. While it snaps the possessed trolls out of their rock zombie state, it destroys the strings, ending music, and causing all the trolls to lose their colors, much to Barb's anguish.Cooper hears his heartbeat over a microphone, and creates a rhythmic beat with it, other trolls joining in with clapping, stomping, and other forms of sound making, reviving the power of their music, and Poppy encourages everyone to sing together as their colors are restored. Realizing how important other forms of music are, and encouraged by her father, Barb joins in, regaining her colors, and eagerly accepts Poppy's offer of friendship.Branch is finally able to profess his love to Poppy who reciprocates his feelings, and everyone performs together, all Trolls finally reunited while celebrating their differences.In a mid-credits scene, Bridget and King Gristle arrive to the Pop Troll village, unaware of the events of the film, and worried they have missed the party."

His family gathers to mourn, and soon a darkness grows, marked by waking nightmares and a growing sense that something evil is taking over the family. The Dark and The Wicked follows two siblings who are summoned back to the family farm to await the inevitability of their father's death. What initially appears to be a timeless ritual of loss and remembrance turns out to be something very different.—Anonymous Louise and Michael are siblings who are brought back to their family farm in Texas when their father's illness, which keeps him bedridden and uncommunicative, cared for by his wife and a nurse, worsens. Their mother seems disturbed and expresses a desire for the children to leave. At night, she hangs herself in the barn after cutting off her own fingers in the kitchen.As time goes on, Louise and Michael start to understand what happened to their mother. The nurse confides in them that she heard her whispering to the father, but it seemed as if she was speaking not to him, but some other presence. Michael finds their mother's diary, which describes her fears of an unnamed and possibly demonic presence preying on her husband.At their mother's burial, Louise and Michael meet Father Thorne, a priest who claims to have known their mother. Later that night, Father Thorne appears at the farm, beckoning them from outside, before vanishing before their eyes. Meanwhile, Charlie, a ranch hand who lives on a nearby plot of land in his RV, witnesses a vision of what appears to be Louise, speaking indistinctly and cutting herself repeatedly with a kitchen knife. The entity drives a distraught Charlie to shoot himself in the head with his shotgun.Louise is subsequently unable to reach Charlie by phone, unaware that he is dead.

Tasya Vos is a corporate agent who uses brain-implant technology to inhabit other people's bodies, driving them to commit assassinations for the benefit of the company. While she has a special gift for the work, her experiences on these jobs have caused a dramatic change in her, and in her own life she struggles to suppress violent memories and urges. As her mental strain intensifies, she begins to lose control, and soon she finds herself trapped in the mind of a man whose identity threatens to destroy her own. In an alternate 2008, Tasya Vos is an assassin who takes control of others' bodies to carry out her hits. Through an implant installed in the unwitting host's brain, Vos can use a special machine to insert her consciousness into their minds. She returns to her own body by forcing the host to commit suicide at the end of each job.Due to the amount of time she spends imitating other people, Vos struggles with increasing detachment from her own identity and cannot fully separate her work from her interactions with her husband, Michael, and son, Ira. She ""practices"" assuming her normal persona the same way she practices impersonating her hosts. Thoughts of violence haunt her during ordinary domestic life such as when putting Ira to bed and having sex with Michael.Vos's handler, retired assassin Girder, is critical of her desire to remain connected to her family and expresses the belief that Vos would be a better killer without personal attachments.

He kills Reeta while struggling with dissociative memories of the hit on Parse and Ava.Eddie, another employee from Vos's company, arrives at the apartment to help her regain control and complete Tate's suicide. The attempt fails. Vos is still unable to make Tate kill himself.Instead, Tate becomes aware of her presence inside his body; his consciousness overpowers hers in a psychic confrontation, giving him access to memories of her husband, child and home. He kills Eddie during their internal battle.Tate then goes to Vos's home and holds her husband at gunpoint, demanding to know what she did to him. When Michael knocks the gun from Tate's hand, Tate kills him with a meat cleaver.Moments later, Ira stabs Tate in the throat, finally killing him. Tate uses his last moments to fatally shoot Ira.Vos returns to her own body and discovers Girder had taken control of Ira to end her struggle with Tate. With Ira and Michael both dead, she is now free of all human attachments, just like Girder wanted.In another debriefing, Vos sorts through the same personal objects from the beginning of the film.

Yearning to own a small patch of land and be more than a chicken sexer, the ambitious paterfamilias, Jacob Yi, relocates his Korean-American family: sceptical wife, Monica, and their children, David and Anne, from California to 1980s rural Arkansas, to start afresh and capture the elusive American Dream. However, new beginnings are always challenging, and to find out what is best for the family, let alone start a 50-acre farm to grow and sell Korean fruits and vegetables, is easier said than done. But, amid sincere promises, cultural unease, fleeting hopes, and the ever-present threat of financial disaster, Jacob is convinced that he has found their own slice of Eden in the rich, dark soil of Arkansas. Can grandma Soonja's humble but resilient minari help the Yi family figure out their place in the world?—Nick Riganas A Korean American family moves to an Arkansas farm in search of its own American dream. Amidst the challenges of this new life in the strange and rugged Ozarks, they discover the undeniable resilience of family and what really makes a home. It's the early 1980s. Married Korean-Americans Jacob and Monica Yi have moved their young family, which includes their two children Anne and David Yi, from urban California to rural Arkansas in pursuit of Jacob's dream to make a success of himself for the family. Like they did in California, Jacob and Monica will work in a factory separating baby chicks by sex for processing, in California making just enough money in such work for Jacob, as the oldest son, to send money home to his family in Korea, but also to make this move. That dream is the fifty acres of land he purchased to start a farm growing Korean vegetables for what he sees as the untapped and burgeoning market of the growing Korean-American population. But this move is not Monica's dream, especially living in the three-bedroom trailer propped on cinder blocks that is on the property as their home, the property itself which is undeveloped and largely unserviced in its isolation. One of Monica's major concerns is exactly that isolation in David having a heart defect and she wanting to be in a city to be closer to doctors and a hospital, especially important if something negative happens unexpectedly and quickly with David. That isolation also means that beyond anything she develops with people at the factory, Monica will have no social network. After some heated arguments, Jacob and Monica come to the compromise that they will stay for Jacob to try and make a go of a farm, and that they will bring Monica's long widowed mother from Korea to act as a caregiver for the children while they're at work. Grandmother's arrival into the already cramped trailer adds its own complications in the family dynamic as David has never met his maternal grandmother, who is not what he envisions an American grandmother should be.—Huggo In 1983, the Korean immigrant Yi family moves from California to their new plot of land in rural Arkansas, where father Jacob hopes to grow Korean produce to sell to vendors in Dallas.

While Jacob is optimistic about the life ahead, his wife Monica is disappointed and worries about their son David's heart condition; due to this he is frequently told not to run. Jacob and Monica work sexing chicks at the nearby hatchery and argue constantly while David and his sister Anne eavesdrop.To help watch the children during the day, they arrange for Monica's mother Soon-ja to travel from South Korea. David, who is forced to share a room with her, avoids her because she does not conform to his idea of how a grandmother should be. Still, Soon-ja attempts to adjust to life in the States and bond with the children.The well that Jacob dug runs dry. Jacob is reluctant to pay for county water, but eventually is forced to do so. He runs into additional difficulties, such as the vendor in Dallas canceling their order at the last minute. Even so, he perseveres despite Monica's vocal desire to return to California. This strains their marriage closer to breaking point.Meanwhile, Soon-ja takes the children to plant minari seeds by the creek. She tells them how resilient and useful the plant is, and predicts plentiful growth. David finally begins to warm to his grandmother after she teaches him card games, bandages his wounds, and soothes him to sleep. Soon-ja also encourages him to do more physical activity, something his parents discourage, saying that he is stronger than they think.Soon-ja suddenly suffers a stroke overnight. She survives with medical treatment, but is left with impaired movement and speech.Jacob, Monica, Anne and David head to Oklahoma City for David's heart appointment and to meet a vendor to sell Jacob's produce. Although they learn that David's heart condition has dramatically improved and Jacob makes a deal to sell vegetables to a Korean grocer, Jacob also indirectly admits to Monica that the success of his crops is more important to him than the stability of their family. Following an emotional argument, the two tacitly agree to separate.However, Soon-ja accidentally sets the barn containing the produce on fire in their absence. Upon arriving home, Jacob rushes in to save the crops, and Monica soon follows. Eventually, the fire grows out of control, and they decide to save each other while leaving the barn to burn.

Above them, Soon-ja is awake, in a chair, watching them sleep with a subdued expression on her face.Some time later, Jacob and Monica are with the water diviner who finds a spot for a well.

His House,2020,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8508734/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A refugee couple makes a harrowing escape from war-torn South Sudan, but then they struggle to adjust to their new life in an English town that has an evil lurking beneath the surface. Bol (Sope Dirisu) and Rial (Wunmi Mosaku) are refugees fleeing with their daughter Nyagak from war-torn South Sudan. To cross the Mediterranean, they brave stormy waters on an overcrowded motorboat, along with fellow refugees traversing the dangerous open sea in search of a better life in Europe. Although they survive the treacherous crossing, their daughter and many others do not. When they are finally granted probational asylum in Britain three months later, the government assigns them a shabby house with peeling walls and dismal furnishings on the outskirts of London. They are given strict restrictions or they may face deportation. They experience racism and hatred from their tenement neighbors. They are met by their case worker Mark (Matt Smith), who tells them he hopes they are two of ""the good ones"".Bol tries to assimilate: he sings football songs, asks Rial to use utensils rather than her hands when they eat, and even changes how he dresses. Bol wants to prove to the government that he and Rial belong in the UK. Rial, however, clings to their culture. She retains their daughter's necklace, dresses in colorful clothes, and rather than using a table, sits on the floor to eat. Both Bol and Rial soon experience strange and disturbing phenomena in their new home, and see visions of Nyagak and a mysterious man, who both escape into the walls.Rial doesn't take long to work out what the evil in their house is: an apeth or ""night witch"". She tells Bol the story of a poor man in her village who accidentally stole from an apeth by the river. When the thief built his home, the apeth moved in with him and haunted him. Rial believes that an apeth has followed them and if they repay their debt, the apeth will bring Nyagak back to them. However it is not immediately clear what the ""debt"" is that they need to repay. Bol burns everything they brought with them, but the apeth continues to torment him and things deteriorate between the couple. He goes to Mark and requests new accommodation under the guise that their unit is infested with rats, but is unable to convince him. Bol tears apart the house looking for the apeth, which threatens the couple's chances of staying in the UK when Mark discovers the damage. However, this is fine with Rial, who tells Bol that she wants to leave. Bol locks Rial in the house before he summons the apeth himself, who calls him a thief and claiming that Bol has stolen a life that was not his to take. The apeth offers Bol a deal: his life for Nyagak's, but he outright refuses this offer, resulting in Bol being forced into a state of momentary catatonia out of anger.Rial manages to escape the house but finds herself inexplicably back in South Sudan in a familiar class room. She is reunited with old friends, who are revealed in a further flashback, to be victims of a horrendous massacre. Rial was able to survive by hiding. Bol finds her and the couple make their escape as violence grips the region, but find that a bus they need to board would only let people with children on. Desperate, Bol sees Nyagak in the crowd and abducts her, falsely claiming that she is their daughter. The couple get on the bus and escape, leaving Nyagak's real mother running behind the bus, as gunfire erupts. Later, many Africans are crossing a rough sea, when Nyagak and others fall overboard. Neither Bol nor Rial could reach her in time. Having accepted what they did, Bol decides to repay the debt to the apeth and tells Rial. Bol starts to let the apeth into his skin and Nyagak enters the room and returns to Rial. Rial chooses to save Bol instead of accepting this alternate reality, by slitting the apeth's throat.Later, Mark comes to inspect the house to find it repaired.

Mank,2020,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10618286/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"1930s Hollywood is re-evaluated through the eyes of scathing social critic and alcoholic screenwriterHerman J. Mankiewiczas he races to finish the screenplay ofCitizen Kane (1941). In 1940, film studio RKO 1940 hires 24-year-old wunderkind Orson Welles under a contract that gives him full creative control of his movies. For his first film, he calls in washed-up alcoholic Herman J. Mankiewicz to write the screenplay. That film is ""Citizen Kane,"" and this is the story of how it was written.—grantss Holed up in the secluded North Verde Ranch in the middle of the Mojave Desert, bedridden American screenwriterHerman J. Mankiewiczhas 60 short days to turn in the first draft of theCitizen Kane (1941)screenplay. Grappling with alcohol addiction,Herman J. Mankiewiczcollaborates withOrson Welles, Hollywood's 24-year-old golden boy, and gets to work. As RKO had already givenOrson Wellescarte blanche,Herman J. Mankiewiczdecides to draw inspiration from his days working for MGM, his friendship with newspaper magnateWilliam Randolph Hearst, and Hearst's 20-year-old girlfriend, actressMarion Daviesof the Ziegfeld Follies.—Nick Riganas Mank captures the life of Mankiewicz between essentially 1933 and 1940, when America
was in the midst of the Depression and watching uneasily, but from far, the gathering
clouds of World War II. There is another presence that Fincher does well to focus on
in his telling of the making of Citizen Kane, the candidacy of Left-leaning Upton Sinclair
for the governorship of California, which sees the tinsel town gang up against him. As
Sinclair is portrayed as promoting ""anti-American"" values, with MGM lending its might
to a campaign that would now be described as fake news, Mank is forced to confront his
own compromises and little lies.In a marvelous scene, Dance's Hearst recounts Oldman's Mank the ""parable of the organ
grinder's monkey"", just after the latter has humiliated himself and Hearst in a drunken
rant about the sold idealism of the newspaper baron. While the monkey thinks it is him
running the show, Hearst reminds Mank, he has to ""dance"", ""every time"", the music plays.That realization is a glimpse of the bitterness that would eventually lead Mank to finding
himself jobless in Hollywood, particularly after his decision to take on Hearst with Welles'
backing. It would also lead him to Citizen Kane - while on the bed with a broken leg, away
from friends and family and fighting for a drink despite alcohol slowly claiming him - as well
as his only Oscar.As Mank explains it to a friend, ""We have got a huge responsibility, to people in the dark willingly checking their disbelief at the door."""

The Wrong Missy,2020,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9619798/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Tim thinks he's invited the woman of his dreams on a work retreat to Hawaii, realizing too late he mistakenly texted someone from a nightmare blind date. Tim (David Spade) has a blind date with Melissa (Lauren Lapkus), nicknamed Missy. Missy is extremely strange, and her odd behavior turns out to be disastrous for Tim. Missy texts Tim as he enters the bar saying that she is a woman in a blue dress, with a meat-head (Joe ""Roman Reigns"" Anoai) hitting on her. Tim interjects and tries to save the woman, who is pregnant. But turns out that the woman in the blue dress was actually the wife and Missy was using this antic as an ice breaker with Tim.
She calls Tim old, and calls out his blonde wig. Tim doesn't drink and Missy is a bit of an alcoholic. She was set up by Tim's grandmother. Missy picks a loud fight with the husband of the woman in the blue dress, claiming he was staring at her (ogling her).. She flashes him a huge knife and is asked to leave the restaurant.
Her wild antics result in Tim sneaking out of the restaurant through a window and subsequently dislocating his ankle.Three months later, Tim's company (Credit Of America) is going through a merger and roles are being re-assigned. Julia (Sarah Chalke) is Tim's ex-fiance is dating Rich (Chris Witaske), who is Tim's colleague. So, as a significant other, she is invited to the company retreat in a few days. Nate (Nick Swardson) is the head of HR and has hacked all of TIm's passwords and knows everything about Tim's personal life.Tim meets a beautiful woman, also named Melissa (Molly Sims), at an airport. They connect with much in common and seem to be perfect for each other (They read the same books, they both don't drink). She ends up giving him her number. He begins texting her (including dick pics) and eventually invites her to his work retreat in Hawaii. However, on the plane, Missy shows up, and Tim realizes he had been texting the wrong Melissa. She says that she was about to jump off a bridge when Tim texted her (Tim assumes she was going to commit suicide, but Missy was just about to go bungee jumping). Missy drugs Tim, forcibly giving him a tranquilizer and he awakens later on the plane to her sexual assaulting him by giving him a hand-job.At the hotel, Missy picks up a fight with kids about riding sea turtles. Tim tells Nate about his messed up by texting the whole Melissa this entire time.
In Hawaii, Jack Winstone (Geoff Pierson), the new CEO, welcomes everyone. Nate has already bragged to Winstone about the 2nd Melissa who is apparently Miss Maryland and a total hottie. Winstone is eager to meet her, while Tim is anxious not to reveal the truth to Winstone. Tim tells Missy about the brags and asks her to cooperate.
Missy is awkward and wild (she give fortuneteller readings to the entire company) and always seems to end up leaving Tim in embarrassing situations (she dances awkwardly on stage in front of everyone, dry humps Tim, bites him, throws food around) in front of his boss and colleagues. Missy gets super drunk and attempts to jump off a cliff, only to mistime her jump and tumbling her way down and landing face first on the beach.
At the hotel, he awakens to her on top of him, sexually assaulting him in his sleep. She often becomes reckless and intoxicated and her behavior results in humiliation for Tim.Winstone takes the team for a shark tank dive off the coast with guide Komante (Rob Schneider), who has lost 3 fingers to shark bite. Missy forces her way onto the boat by jumping out, while Tim wanted the boat to leave without her. Once out in the ocean, she forces Tim to enter the cage with Winstone, even though Tim tried hard not to participate by saying he needed to take care of a sick Missy. Then Missy chops up some fish bits and throws them in the water to attract the sharks. A great white comes swimming and attacks the cage really hard. The cage breaks and the shark gets in. In the panic Tim breaks Winstone's nose. Komante punches the shark in the nose to make it go away. Missy administers CPR to Winstone to revive him after he swallows too much water in his lungs.Back at the room, TIm asks Missy to not venture out. Missy decides to spend time with Barbara (Arlene Newman) (staying in the room next door), who heard Tim & Missy have sex the night before. Barbara told her that her husband didn't make those noises since their honeymoon 30 yrs ago. Missy decides to go to a spa with Barbara. When Tim narrates this to Nate, he is horrified, since Barbara is Winstone's wife. TIm rushes back only to find that Missy had advised Barbara to break up with Winstone.
Winstone finds out that Missy meddled in his marriage and in his rage he trips over and hurts his neck. Missy snaps his neck back into position and tells Winstone that he is responsible for the marriage falling apart.As time goes on, she starts to help Tim do well at his work retreat and also wins Winstone's favor towards Tim by hypnotizing him (she spent the whole night with Barbara and Winstone and used that opportunity to Hynotize him). At the talent show Tim's team puts in a really lousy performance but Winstone applauds Tim and keeps saying ""I Love that guy"". Tim asks Missy and she admits that she hypnotized him.
Tim eventually begins to fall for her. Throughout Janice can see how much fun Missy is having and the laughs she shares with Tim. Janice reaches out to Missy, who convinces her to have a threesome with her and Tim
Tim's workplace competitor, Jess (Jackie Sandler) ('The Barracuda'), is not pleased with Winstone giving a job to Tim instead of her. So Jess reveals to Missy that she was invited there by accident and wasn't the one Tim wanted to invite. Missy checks Tim's phone and finds out the truth. Saddened and devastated, she leaves Hawaii.Meanwhile, the actual Melissa arrives in Hawaii, having been invited by Jess. At lunch, Tim begins acting much like Missy did on their first date, taking multiple shots and performing a handstand in the diner. Tim lets her know that he has feelings for someone else and leaves Hawaii for Portland. Tim also removes the hypnotism Missy put on Winstone, and Tim ends up quitting his job.
Tim meets with Missy and he apologizes and tells her all the things that he likes about her and that he wants to be more like her. She forgives him, and they kiss."

The Trial of the Chicago 7,2020,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1070874/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The story of 7 people on trial stemming from various charges surrounding the uprising at the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago, Illinois. In Chicago 1968, the Democratic Party Convention was met with protests from activists like the moderate Students for a Democratic Society led by Tom Hayden and the militant Yippies led by Abbie Hoffman and Jerry Rubin, which led to violent confrontations with the local authorities. As a result, seven of the accused ringleaders are arraigned on charges like Conspiracy by the hostile Nixon administration, including Bobby Seale of the Black Panthers who was not involved in the incident. What follows is an unfair trial presided by the belligerent Judge Hoffman (No relation) and prosecuted by a reluctant but duty-bound Richard Schultz. As their pro bono lawyers face such odds, Hayden and his fellows are frustrated by the Yippies' outrageous antics undermining their defense in defiance of the system even while Seale is denied a chance to defend himself his way. Along the way, the Chicago 7 clash in their political philosophies even as they learn they need each other in this fight.—Kenneth Chisholm (kchishol1970@gmail.com) What was intended to be a peaceful protest at the 1968 Democratic National Convention turned into a violent clash with police and the National Guard. The organizers of the protest--including Abbie Hoffman, Jerry Rubin, Tom Hayden, and Bobby Seale--were charged with conspiracy to incite a riot. The trial that followed was one of the most notorious in history.—yusufpiskin 1969. With the newRichard Nixonadministration in the White House, US Attorney GeneralJohn Mitchellproceeds to lay charges againstTom HaydenandRennie Davis, leaders of Students for Democratic Society,Abbie HoffmanandJerry Rubin, leaders of the Youth International Parties (Yippies or Young Hippies),David Dellinger, leader of Mobilization to End the War in Vietnam (The Mobe), individualsLee WeinerandJohn Froines, andBobby Seale, National Chair of the Black Panthers, under the never used Rap Brown Law: for ""conspiracy to cross state lines in order to incite violence"" for their roles in the protest outside the National Democratic Convention (DNC) in Chicago the summer previous, the protest which turned violent. The protest was against the United States' escalating participation in the Vietnam War, the DNC chosen for then PresidentLyndon B. Johnson's doubling of troops almost overnight and the presumptive Democratic nominee for President,Hubert H. Humphrey, continuing such if elected. In part as they are using the same legal team ofWilliam KunstlerandLeonard Weinglass, the first seven are deemed the Chicago 7, with Seale the outsider for many reasons, including he being the only one of the eight a person of color. If convicted, they could serve a maximum penalty of ten years in prison. While the eight are aware of each other, some had never met before the protest and rarely collaborated. As such, the lead prosecutor, Richard Schultz, as does everyone else involved in this case, is aware that the charges and thus the trial are politically motivated rather than a matter of justice under the law, with each of the eight of the eight hundred or so protesters chosen for very specific political reasons, and as former Attorney General under Johnson,Ramsey Clark, had no intention of laying charges after the Justice Department's review.—Huggo In the wake of the bloody events before and after the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago, where unarmed protesters were pitted against armed-to-the-teeth police officers in Lincoln Park, Attorney GeneralJohn Mitchell, appoints prosecutors, Richard Schultz andTom Foran, to bring eight men to trial for inciting violence. In 1969, underRichard Nixon's presidency, eight alleged ringleaders faced charges of conspiracy and promoting riot. They were the Conspiracy Eight:Tom HaydenandRennie Davis, enthusiastic and silver-tongued leaders of the Students for a Democratic Society; Yippies,Abbie HoffmanandJerry Rubin, who ran the Youth International Party; radical pacifist and conscientious objector,David Dellinger; anti-war activist,John Froines; teaching assistant,Lee Weiner, and co-founder of the Black Panther Party,Bobby Seale, whose case was eventually declared a mistrial. Apart fromBobby Seale, all the defendants were represented byWilliam KunstlerandLeonard Weinglass, who were convinced that the charges are politically motivated. The judge was bigoted Julius Hoffman who refused to let the progressive, former U.S. Attorney General,Ramsey Clark, testify in front of the jury. But, who started the riots? Was it the protesters or the police?—Nick Riganas During the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago, there were massive demonstrations against the Vietnam War, which was reaching its peak. When a curfew was finally instated, this led to even further protests, eventually leading to a police riot. Following this, seven of the demonstrators (Abbie Hoffman, Jerry Rubin, Bobby Seale, John Froines, Tom Hayden, Lee Weiner, and David Dellinger) were tried for conspiracy. This is the story of the trial that followed."

Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga,2020,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8580274/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"When aspiring musicians Lars and Sigrit are given the opportunity to represent their country at the world's biggest song competition, they finally have a chance to prove that any dream worth having is a dream worth fighting for. In the small town of Húsavík, Iceland, Lars Ericksson and Sigrit Ericksdóttir, best friends since childhood, make music together as the band Fire Saga, much to the dismay of Lars' widowed father, Erick (""Volcano Man""). Lars has one dream: to win the Eurovision Song Contest. But at the local bar where they perform, the only song the audience wants to hear is the suggestive nonsense song ""Ja Ja Ding Dong"". Sigrit's mother Helga also disapproves of their partnership, saying that Lars is holding Sigrit back, and that she will never hit the ""Speorg note""-a note that can only be sung when being your truest self-when singing with him. The pair apply and are selected to take part in Söngvakeppnin, the Icelandic pre-selection for Eurovision, without the committee looking at their audition tape. Lars is so ecstatic about their participation that he rings the church belltower, resulting in him being arrested by a policeman for falsely signalling an emergency. Lars says that the town is near death and that Fire Saga's participation in the contest is the only chance their town has to be alive. Sigrit convinces the police officers to free him. Sigrit, who believes in the old Icelandic tradition of elves, asks the elves for help to get them into the contest in the hope that if Fire Saga wins, Lars will return Sigrit's romantic feelings for him.Fire Saga's performance at Söngvakeppnin goes wrong due to technical problems (""Double Trouble""). A dejected Lars declines to attend the boat party thrown for all the finalists and sits on the dock as Sigrit tries to console him. Suddenly, the boat explodes, killing everyone on board and leaving Fire Saga as the only surviving contestants and thus final winners by default, much to the disappointment of the participation committee. Lars and Sigrit arrive in Edinburgh, Scotland, where Eurovision is being held (""Amar pelos dois""). Once there, Lars rebuffs Sigrit's attempts to kiss him, reiterating that they need to focus on the competition, not their relationship. They struggle with a new remix of their song and Lars' elaborate staging plans, and meet Alexander Lemtov, the Russian representative who is a favorite to win the contest (""Lion of Love"").Alexander invites Lars and Sigrit to a party at his house, attended by numerous real-life former Eurovision contestants, where he introduces them both to multiple other contestants, including the Greek contestant Mita Xenakis. They join the other contestants in a ""Song-a-Long"" (a mashup of ""Believe"", ""Ray of Light"", ""Ne partez pas sans moi"", ""Waterloo"" and ""I Gotta Feeling""). Alexander and Sigrit spend the night together, as do Lars and Mita, although neither pair becomes intimate. At their rehearsal, Sigrit expresses her hate for the new clothing and remix and asks Lars to go back to the way things originally were, which Lars does. Later, back at the hotel, Lars overhears Sigrit working on a new song and presumes that it is a love song made for Alexander and that they are pursuing a romantic relationship.Their semi-final performance of ""Double Trouble"" initially runs well, but is botched by an accident involving Sigrit's scarf getting caught in a hamster wheel prop, which rolls off the stage and into the audience. The two recover and finish the song, but are met with deafening silence and scattered laughter. Believing Fire Saga has become a laughing stock, they exit the stage, unaware that the crowd has erupted with applause for their persistence in finishing the performance. An angry Lars prepares to return to Iceland. Sigrit pleads with Lars to stay, but Lars angrily refuses, telling Sigrit to go sing her love song for Alexander, upon which she reveals that she wrote it for Lars. Lars returns to Iceland to become a fisherman with his father, unaware that Fire Saga has qualified for the final.Out at sea, Lars confesses his love for Sigrit to his father Erick, who convinces him to go back and fight for his love, expressing admiration for finishing his semi-final performance despite the mishap. Upon learning that Iceland is in the final, Lars dives off the boat and leaves for Edinburgh. Meanwhile, Alexander sees an opportunity to establish a partnership with Sigrit, but she declines. Sigrit realizes that Alexander is gay but can't come out because of homophobia in Russia. Lars hitches a ride with Victor Karlosson (governor of the Central Bank of Iceland, and one of the Icelandic organizational team members), who attempts to murder Lars and reveals that he blew up the boat at Söngvakeppnin, for fear that Iceland would not be able to host Eurovision the following year if they win due to bankruptcy. Unseen elves save Lars by killing Victor with a thrown knife in the back, allowing Lars to make it back to the final in time. Interrupting their performance, he encourages Sigrit to ditch their official entry and perform the song she has written for him (""Húsavík""). Lars starts playing the song on the piano, and Sigrit sings her song, culminating with a Speorg note, touching the audience and the people of Húsavík. Realising that they are in love with each other, Lars and Sigrit kiss on stage to a standing ovation in the audience. Backstage, Alexander is happy for them and accepts Mita's invitation to come to Greece with her in order to find his own happiness.Fire Saga is disqualified for changing their song during the contest, but both Lars and Sigrit have lost interest in winning the competition, realizing that their relationship is more important. Back in Húsavík, Lars and Sigrit awake on the bus to a huge cheering crowd of locals. Some time later, Fire Saga is back to performing in the local bar, this time at the wedding reception of Lars' father and Sigrit's mother. Bringing their newborn baby along, they ask if anyone wants to hear their Eurovision song, but the crowd once again demands ""Ja Ja Ding Dong"""

They discover that the bullets used in the crime were Remingtons while Luke only owned Winchesters, indicating that the killer used different ammunition to what the family owned.Falk interviews Scott Whitlam, the principal of the local school and Karen's boss, who explains that although she was struggling to gather funding for the school, she didn't seem to have any troubles. Falk and Raco discover that McMurdo was spotted upon CCTV footage. Falk discovers the word 'grant?' on the back of the library receipt, leading Falk to suspect that Ellie's brother, Grant Dow, wants to purchase the family's farm once it goes on the market due to Luke's parents being unable to keep it. Dow denies this, although he and his father are still vile towards Falk.When Falk visits Gretchen, another childhood friend and Karen's co-worker, she explains some documents on her table are applications for school funding. While reminiscing over an old photo album, Falk discovers that Luke is the father of Gretchen's only child Lachlan. Falk takes some of the funding applications and realizes that Karen's writing of 'grant?' referred to funds being granted, not Dow, now suspecting Whitlam of embezzlement.Falk and Raco go to question Whitlam at the school, only to find he has fled to the bush. Whitlam admits to his gambling addiction and stealing money from the school to pay back his debts, and that he murdered the family to cover up his fraud. Whitlam drenches himself in oil and lights himself on fire to kill himself. Falk and Raco tackle the burning Whitlam to the ground and put out the fire themselves, stopping it from spreading to the trees and sparking a bush-fire. Raco is burnt and hospitalized, but the investigation is closed, clearing Luke's innocence.Leaving town, Falk visits the rocky area that he and Ellie used to frequent, only to find her old backpack, which contains a journal noting that her father was abusing her. Flashbacks indicate that her father drowned and killed her himself. Falk walks back with the backpack along the riverbed, now completely dry."

When William's girlfriend Claire, reminds him that Eugene needs to settle his tab, the boys get lucky when a tourist couple comes to the Stoker pub because they want to track the places Bram Stoker has been to.Eugene and his friends immediately agree to take them to see the cairn where Bram got his inspiration for Dracula. The price? A couple of beers.The couple instantly agrees and set about on the hike up to the place where a cairn is which is to be left undisturbed.The boys narrate the tale of the Abhartach before scaring them which pisses off the tourists who leave. The Boys wonder if the couple will now break up because the guy scared too easily.Eugene later funds bones in the basement of his mother's house and immediately thinks of calling archaeologists and earning some extra cash so he can get out of this little town, but when his father Francie learns of his son's plan he reprimands him and forbids him from ruining his mother's house.Upset and drunk, Eugene hangs out with William late at night, near the cairn when suddenly William is attacked by something that looks like a boar.William dies and in the next scene, everyone is already at the funeral, paying respects.Francie runs a construction company and is given the assignment to make a bypass road in the area which means the cairn has to be taken down.The crew workers are reluctant to do that but Eugene takes it upon himself to topple the cairn just to show his father how responsible he is towards his work.He does exactly that with a bulldozer and later, leaves the area under another crewman's supervision, Charlie.But Charlie is attacked and the next day, he cannot be found anywhere.

After seeing his wife's grief, George had dug up his son and used a rock from the cairn to bring him back to life. This causes Pauline to go into shock as William wakes up. But he isn't human anymore and has to be kept locked up.Eugene convinces George that the guy he has locked up isn't his son anymore and definitely isn't the sort of person who would willingly buy a pint for his friends considering he's a vampire and all.George agrees to kill his monster son but the plan backfires when Pauline awakens from her catatonic state and shoots her husband in the arm.William isn't too pleased with that kind of domestic violence and slits Pauline's throat before feeding on her.Eugene and his friends and father run out of the house and try to get into the car but it won't start.George comes out again and states that while he can't shoot his son, he will kill himself but as luck would have it, he is out of shells and William attacks his father.Meanwhile, the sheriff awakens in the middle of the night to pee and is shocked to see blood but not overly so.As viewers, we have been told that people start oozing blood whenever Abhartach is nearby. The creature doesn't need to attack and feed. He simply has to be near a person and they would start leaking blood and a trail forms right up to him.Eugene, Francie, Claire and SP come up with a plan to contain William in a coffin but he is too strong and attacks everyone before being stuffed into a coffin.Eugene goes in search of SP, knowing he was hurt and finds the fridge open, and his friend in front of the TV with a beer in his hand.He declares this was the way he always wanted to go and dies.The remaining three decide they need to find a way to defeat Abhartach but when Claire learns her parents are leaking blood too, stays with them.After all, the movie is called Boys from County Hell and there is no place for her in the climax.Eugene decides that Abhartach must be buried again and must be hiding in his mother's house because of the bones he had found earlier.Father and son head out there and are promptly attacked by Abhartach.Francie has his leg almost ripped out and Eugene learns that everything he knew about vampires was wrong, including them disintegrating in sunlight.So Francie encourages his son to stake the creature and bury him under rocks.In the chaos, Eugene is unable to find a suitable weapon and Francie offers his leg.As Abhartach approaches, Eugene stabs the monster with it and then buries him under rocks.The town is safe for now and all the citizens awaken.Three months later, Claire is going away while Eugene is now officially part of his father's roadworks company.His main concern is to make sure there are enough rocks atop Abhartach.

Revolutionary businessmen Bernard Garrett (Anthony Mackie) and Joe Morris (Samuel L. Jackson) devise an audacious and risky plan to take on the racist establishment of the 1960s by helping other African Americans pursue the American dream. Along with Garrett's wife Eunice (Nia Long), they train a working class white man, Matt Steiner (Nicholas Hoult), to pose as the rich and privileged face of their burgeoning real estate and banking empire - while Garrett and Morris pose as a janitor and a chauffeur. Their success ultimately draws the attention of the federal government, which threatens everything the four have built.Bernard learned banking in 1939 by shining shoes outside a bank and hearing customers and bankers talk about their business. His father told him that he was talented, but that wouldn't amount to anything in the racist Texas. Bernard goes to LA in 1954. He is married and has a son. He wants to use his savings from a company he ran in Texas to start a real estate business in LA.
Bernard finds a gated society in a white neighborhood, which is 2 blocks away from a colored society, and knows that there will be plenty of demand for houses to rent. However the asking price is high and he wont have anything left over to renovate. Eunice takes him to Joe to be his co-investor. Joe is a casual man, who starts drinking early, and Bernard is the serious type. Bernard doesn't like Joe.Patrick Barker (Colm Meaney) the man selling the society is asking $40K. Bernard explains that he will pay $30K, then renovate the building to rent it to colored doctors and lawyers who are well paid but are forced to live in slums as there are no other options. This would improve building occupancy from current 50% to 100%. Bernard will pay Patrick the other $10K in 9 months time. Patrick likes Bernard's confidence and helps him get a loan from the bank to pay him his $10K upfront.Joe warns Bernard against trusting Patrick. Bernard hires Matt (a white man) to do renovations on the ""white"" building as the current ""white"" inhabitants complained about Bernard's presence. Soon enough the white residents move out and Bernard leases the apartment to colored tenants.
Patrick offers a deal for a 50:50 partnership in future investments, with the condition that Patrick will be the face for the deals and Bernard will work behind the scenes. They buy a dozen properties together, but then Patrick dies. Mrs Barker (Rhoda Griffis) is not comfortable doing business with Bernard and offers him a fraction (25%) of the money he put in (since his name is not on any of the investments).
Bernard goes to the Banker who loaned him to help him prove Patrick's intention, but the banker refuses to meet him.Bernard goes to Joe with a plan to buy the bank's building and then use the knowledge of the bank to buy properties in white neighborhoods in LA. He convinces Joe to hire Matt as the ""white"" CEO of their company, which would make it easier for them to buy anything they want. They teach Maths and golf to Matt so he talk and walk like a white educated man. Donald Silverthorne (Paul Ben-Victor) is a banker from SFO who finances Joe and Bernard.
Matt acts very smart, memorizes all the numbers and buys a $2MM property for $1.56MM. Bernard goes on a property buying spree.Matt marries Susie (Taylor Black), a girl he had met at the local diner. Soon the company owns 200 buildings. Soon, Bernard comes with a plan to buy a bank in his home town in Texas, which is still racially very segregated. Joe warns him against this, but Bernard is adamant that he can help more white folks with this. Bernard and Joe again use Matt as front to buy the Mainland bank. This time the owner of the bank secures a job for his son Robert Florance, Jr. (Scott Daniel Johnson) as a loan officer (along with a 20% stake), as part of the deal.Robert quickly figures out that after acquiring Matt is approving loans to colored homes and businesses. Meanwhile Susie is pushing Matt that he should not allow colored people to treat his like an employee. Florence reports the banks' activities and the bank is to be audited by the US treasury in a month. Matt proposes that the trio buy another bank (The Marlin Bank( and move the colored loans to Marlin till Mainland is audited. To circumvent the ownership problem, he proposes that Joe and Bernard let Matt run Marlin on his own. Bernard is against this, but Matt threatens to resign if they don't agree. Joe convinces Bernard.Matt takes charge of Marlin and soon shifts the loans onto the Marlin's books. Within a week the US Treasury official comes to Matt to audit Marlin's books. The official finds several loans in the books that are not according to the banking act. Turns out that Matt had hired a lawyer suggested by Florence to buy the loans from Mainland and the lawyer teamed with Florence to add a few loans that violated the banking act within the package that Matt didn't check properly.
This forces Joe and Bernard to help Matt sell 27 loans within a week and take a hit of $300K on their books. Joe and Bernard tell Matt that Marlin would have to close to absorb the losses.Matt decides to use the Mainland to buy the dud loans from the new bank at face value, thus keeping the new bank solvent. This is fraud. Mainland is closed by the US Govt and Joe + Bernard are arrested by the FBI.
Matt is offered a deal by the FBI to testify against Joe and Bernard or face jail time himself. Matt lies. Joe and Bernard are convicted in 1965 by an all-white jury and sent to 3 yrs in prison. Of the 177 buildings they owned, only one was left as it was in Eunice's name. Robert Florance bought the Mainland bank back from the GOvt at a fraction of the cost Bernard and Joe paid for it to his father."

Then, on one of his travels, the irresistible storyteller comes across the gruesome scene of a murder, and encounters the abducted ten-year-old orphan, Johanna: now, the proud daughter of the Kiowa nomadic warriors, Turning Water and Three Spotted. To reunite the savage girl with her only surviving kin, patient Jefferson is willing to brave the perils of the long journey back and risk life and limb for twice-orphaned Johanna. But, amid harsh territories once divided by war, what will it take to find this orphan a home?—Nick Riganas In 1870, Captain Jefferson Kyle Kidd is a former member of the Confederate Infantry who now makes a living traveling town to town reading newspapers for the populace for ten cents per person. Following one such evening of news reading, Kidd sets out for his next location when he encounters an overturned wagon on the road. Dismounting to investigate further, he encounters a lynched black man and a young white girl named Johanna who is dressed in Native American clothing. After an encounter with a Union Army patrol, Kidd is instructed to take the girl to Union officials at a checkpoint in a town up the road where they will sort out her Bureau of Indian Affairs paperwork and see to it she is returned to her surviving family. Reluctantly, Kidd acquiesces to the request.At the Union checkpoint Kidd is informed that the Bureau of Indian Affairs representative is on the reservation and will be unavailable for three months. Seeking shelter with a former Confederate infantryman, Kidd reads the news and upon returning, begrudgingly accepts responsibility for returning the girl to her surviving family. As the two set out they attempt to find common ground, but neither one has much success in communicating with the other. This is further compounded at the next stop, when Kidd is confronted by three ex-Confederate soldiers turned criminals who express an interest in purchasing the girl from Kidd. Kidd refuses, but the three men pursue, leading to a shootout in the wilderness during which Johanna and Kidd overcome obstacles to work together for self-preservation.At the next stop, Kidd encounters a radical band of militia working to ""cleanse"" the county from ""outsiders"".

In the aftermath, Kidd and Johanna join a wagon train bound for a town with the railroad line before veering off to locate Johanna's surviving family. During the journey Kidd's wagon is destroyed, leaving Johanna and Kidd to continue on foot until the pair encounter Kiowa tribesmen from whom Johanna is able to obtain a horse.Kidd and Johanna eventually reach her aunt and uncle's farmstead, the former revealing that Johanna's parents had struck out on their own and moved to hill country where the land would be cheaper; this led to them being killed in a Kiowa raid. Kidd reluctantly leaves Johanna (who is resistant) with them, and returns to San Antonio. His wife, Maria Luisa Betancourt Kidd, died from cholera in 1865. Now without any kin, he visits the mission where she is buried, and mournfully leaves his wedding ring and locket containing her picture on her grave.Kidd then rides back to the village where he left Johanna, where he finds her tied to a pole, her belligerent aunt and uncle explaining that she refused to work and would instead run off. Asking forgiveness, Kidd tells Johanna (in Kiowa) that she belongs with him. Johanna accepts; her aunt and uncle reluctantly let them go. In an epilogue, Kidd reads the papers at another pulpit, with Johanna helping out on sound effects and bearing a new name: Johanna Kidd."

To this day, they have not written the song that will unite the world.In the present day, Bill and Ted are at a wedding to perform for Ted's younger brother Deacon (Beck Bennett) and Missy (Amy Stoch), who married both Bill and Ted's dads first. The guys play a mish-mash of instruments in their attempts to create their big song, but it just sounds bad, and Ted's elderly dad Jonathan (Hal Landon Jr.) thinks Bill and Ted are just washed up losers who waste their time and have been poor role models to their daughters, while also saying that their wives, Princess Joanna, ""Jo"" (Jayma Mays) and Princess Elizabeth, ""Liz"" (Erinn Hayes), are the only real adults in their families, but Billie and Thea still believe in their dads.Liz and Jo bring their husbands to couples therapy, even though the intention was to do it separately. They talk to Dr. Wood (Jillian Bell), where it is apparent that Bill and Ted can't do anything without each other, even tell their own wives ""I love you"". Liz and Jo admit that while they love their husbands, they do feel that the two are just going through are a routine that they can't grow out of.Bill and Ted go home feeling upset over how they are viewed, with Ted even thinking of selling his Les Paul guitar to make money. Suddenly, an egg-shaped time machine appears. Out steps Kelly (Kristen School), the daughter of the guys' previous time-travel guide Rufus who had apparently passed away some years earlier. Kelly tells Bill and Ted that they need to go with her. Billie and Thea watch as their dads hop in the time machine. The guys are taken 700 years into the future in San Dimas, California where Kelly brings them to meet her mom, The Great Leader (Holland Taylor). She explains to the guys that since they still haven't written the song that will unite the world, and worse still time and reality have begun bending in an event called ""The Unraveling"", and if the guys can't produce the song within less than 80 minutes (7:17 PM specifically), reality is doomed. Kelly gives them a pocket watch from her father that will keep track of time in San Dimas. Bill and Ted know they won't have enough time, so they decide to try and go into their own futures to steal the song from themselves when they think they have already written it. They hop inside their old time traveling phone booth and head out.The guys end up in 2022 to find their future selves are performing at a lounge for people who aren't even listening to them. Present-Bill and Ted confront their future selves and learn that they have become bigger failures, not only in their music, but Liz and Jo left them after their own future selves showed them that there is no happy life with them, and their own daughters have stopped talking to them. The guys rush back to their present time-line to find their wives in therapy again, where they beg them not to join their future selves, but they still have a hard time saying ""I love you"" to them. Liz and Jo then see their future selves in their own time machine and head out. Dr. Wood also sees a historical figure appear on her couch, and she leaves.Back in the future, the Great Leader tells Kelly that perhaps the only way to bring balance back to reality is to have Bill and Ted killed. She sends a time-traveling cyborg called Dennis (Anthony Carrigan) to hunt the duo. Kelly then uses her time machine to go back to present day San Dimas to find Bill and Ted, but instead finds Billie and Thea, and the two decide they want to help their dads unite the world. They use the machine to go back to 1968 to meet Jimi Hendrix (DazMann Still) and try and recruit him for their song by uniting some of the greatest artists in history. Jimi is uninterested, so the girls realize they'll need bigger inspiration.Meanwhile, Bill and Ted go to 2025 where they come across a large mansion, thinking they have made it big as rock stars by now. They find their future selves dressed in flashy clothes and speaking with posh British accents that they say they got from time-traveling with their wives through the Medieval ages. They give their past selves what is supposedly the song that will unite the world for them to take back to their time, but as they are leaving, Present-Bill and Ted discover that the mansion belongs to Dave Grohl, and their old selves are actually balding, fat, alcoholics who are even worse than their 2022 selves. Jonathan and Deacon arrive with the SWAT team after Dave calls the cops, and since Future-Bill and Ted know what their past selves are going to do, Present-Bill and Ted come up with a crazy plan to cover their heads with buckets so their future selves won't know where they went. The guys make it to their time machine, just as Dennis arrives and prepares to vaporize them, but he is too late, as the guys leave, and he accidentally zaps Jonathan. He ends up in Hell where he is greeted by Death (William Sadler).Billie and Thea go to 1928 to find Louis Armstrong (Jeremiah Craft) where Billie shows him a video she recorded of Jimi onstage. Louis is impressed and goes to 1968 with the girls to meet Jimi. Although he still appears to not want to do it, especially since Louis Armstrong would be an old man at that time, Louis plays his trumpet, which is enough to convince Jimi to join them. They then take the two artists all the way back to Vienna in 1782 to find Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (Daniel Dorr). They hear him performing one of his pieces, and Jimi takes out his guitar to mimic the notes. Mozart is impressed by what he hears and joins the team.Bill and Ted then go to 2030 where they find their future selves in prison, both of them jacked and tattooed. They took the fall for breaking into Dave's house, and now they plan to beat their past selves for it. However, Dennis shows up and attempts to kill Present-Bill and Ted, which Prison-Bill and Ted know will mean that they will die too. They get the inmates to pile on Dennis as Present-Bill and Ted make their escape.Billie and Thea bring the three musicians to China in 2600 B.C. to meet Ling Lun (Sharon Gee), the founder of music in China. Mozart plays her bamboo flute, and she joins them. The girls take them even further into the past to North Africa where they meet a dimmer called Grom (Patty Anne Miller). They convince her to come along as well. With their band assembled, the girls return to present day San Dimas, where Kid Cudi also appears with time and reality still unraveling. He seems to understand the paradox that is occurring, just as Dennis shows up. He accidentally vaporizes everybody, as well as Kelly, and sends them all to Hell.Bill and Ted decide to go all the way to the end of their lives, which is somewhere in 2067. They find themselves super old in a retirement home. They present their younger selves with a flash drive containing their big song, called ""Face The Music"" and labeled ""Preston/Logan MP46 7:17"" (MP46 is where they need to go). As they prepare to head back, Dennis shows up to get Bill and Ted, but his programming won't allow him to kill them since they have the song. When they learn that he sent their daughters to Hell, Bill breaks the flash drive to get Dennis to kill them, but Dennis instead has a nervous breakdown and tries to kill himself. Bill and Ted jump into the path of the laser, which Liz and Jo see as their machine brings them to that time.The guys end up back in Hell and go searching for their daughters. They find them, as well as Jonathan, who realizes that everything Bill and Ted told them about time travel and death was true. After reuniting, they figure that they can get back to Earth with Death's help, but he had a falling out with Bill and Ted after they kicked him out of Wyld Stallyns for performing overlong solos. Billie and Thea talk to Death, as they are actually fans of his bass-playing, and they convince him to give their dads another chance. After Bill and Ted apologize, Death uses Jonathan's SWAT van to bring the family, and the historical musicians, back up to Earth.Everybody arrives in the present day 2020 on Interstate 210, which is where MP46 is. All of time and space starts coming undone, with monuments and other figures start jumping to other time periods and locations. Dennis gives Bill and Ted the pieces of the flash drive, but they still don't know how to write their big song. They then realize that the ""Preston/Logan"" is not them, but rather Thea and Billie, as they are the masterminds behind the big song, and their dads are their to back them up. The girls give instruments to their band members, which doesn't sound too great at first until they start to get things in sync. Liz and Jo show up and tell the guys that the happiest time-line with them is the one they are in now. Bill and Ted finally individually tell their wives they love them, and they all go through history to give everyone instruments to play, thereby actually uniting the whole world in song. When the guys return, they play epic guitar solos for the whole world to hear. Reality begins to set itself back to normal. Kelly and Dennis return to the future, where the Great Leader commends Kelly for her work, and everyone returns to their regular time-lines. Billie and Thea end with their narration on how their dads helped unite the world by getting everyone to play together.The end credits show people all over the world playing music together. After the credits, we see Old Bill and Ted checking up on each other before standing up to do another epic guitar solo."
The Secret: Dare to Dream,2020,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4411584/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A feature film adaptation of the self-help book, 'The Secret', which focuses on the power of positive thinking. Based on the groundbreaking best-selling book by Rhonda Byrne, The Secret: Dare to Dream follows Miranda (Katie Holmes), a young widow trying to make ends meet while raising her three children and dating her boyfriend (Jerry O'Connell). A devastating storm brings an enormous challenge and a mysterious man, Bray (Josh Lucas), into Miranda's life. Bray reignites the family's spirit but, unbeknownst to Miranda, also holds an important secret - one that will change everything. With its timeless messages of hope, compassion, and gratitude, The Secret: Dare to Dream is an inspiring and heartwarming film that shows how positive thoughts can transform our lives.—Lionsgate The movie opens on a woman, Miranda Wells, shopping among the fishermen at the docks for her boss/boyfriend's seafood restaurant. She delivers the fish and crabs to the restaurant and is reminded that she has a dentist appointment. Her boss/boyfriend, Tucker Middendorf, reveals to her that he needs to postpone their dinner plans for that evening due to the need to board up the restaurant since a tropical storm/hurricane is approaching their area. At the dentist's office she is told she has some big cavities and needs a root canal, which is very expensive and well beyond her current means. After leaving the dentist she receives a call from Bobbi, who we learn later is her former mother-in-law, who expresses a desire that she go someplace safe since she doesn't think her home is sturdy enough to withstand the storm. Miranda's dialogue throughout all these scenes make it clear she has a very negative outlook on life and constantly expects the worst.In the meantime, we see a man named Bray Johnson check into a local hotel. We see him later at Miranda's home where he meets her son Greg who is fishing while he is home from school. Bray was intending to give Miranda an envelope but says he will bring it back later because it requires explanation. A short time later Miranda has picked up her daughters Chloe and Missy from school. She gets into an argument with Missy and is distracted enough that she rear-ends Brays pickup. His truck isn't hurt but her minivan has minor damage that Bray offers to fix. They don't introduce themselves to each other right away but when he follows her home he realizes who she is. He decides not to give her the envelope right away and fixes the minivan with Greg's help. As he is visiting with Miranda and her children it becomes apparent Bray has a much brighter outlook on life and proffers the idea to the group that much of what happens to us in life is a result of our expectations and our belief that good things will happen. The children had asked for pizza for supper but Miranda had told them that they couldn't afford it but just at that moment a pizza delivery, sent by Tuck, arrives. The predicted wind and rains from the storm start just as Bray is leaving. He decides to put the envelope in Miranda's mailbox instead of giving it to her in person.During the storm in the night the mailbox is blown away and a large limb falls thru Miranda's roof. She and the children huddle together in the bathroom til the morning when they can assess the damage. Bray returns to make sure she got the envelope and sees the mailbox is gone and also all the damage to the home. He again offers his assistance in repairing the roof since he has time before he has to return to his job teaching engineering at Vanderbilt university. Miranda says she can't afford a new roof but Bray outlines a clear plan to fix the major damage that will cost less than a tenth of what she expected so she agrees. Bobbi arrives and it's clear she sees Bray as an interloper that might interfere with her hope that Miranda marry Tucker. Bobbi knows Miranda is in quite a bit of debt and she expresses to Miranda that Tucker is a good-looking man, a dependable provider and obviously cares for her very much. She takes Miranda and the children to her home to stay while Bray completes repairs. They visit Tuck's restaurant and tell him they will be staying at Bobbi's while the house is being repaired. Tucker is curious about the stranger who is repairing the roof so he visits and talks briefly with Bray. Bray makes it clear he has no romantic intentions toward Miranda and is merely helping out because he has the skills and opportunity. We also see Bray have a conversation with a woman who is obviously expecting him to return home soon. That evening Miranda goes for a walk and calls Bray, She expresses uncertainty on how to deal with many things in her life and Bray shares the idea that if she keeps a positive outlook things will eventually become clear. The next day he finishes the roof and has a conversation with MIssy regarding her sixteenth birthday party that gives Missy a much-improved outlook on her own situation. As a result Missy demands that he come to her party the next day, which results in him postponing his departure again.That night at the restaurant's reopening Tucker proposes to Miranda and she accepts. The children are obviously unhappy about the situation but Bobbi is elated. Miranda's reaction seems measured and not overly excited, almost as if she's unsure about it. The children go home with Bobbi again while Miranda and Tucker spend the night together. The next morning Tucker has a brand new vehicle delivered to his apartment as a gift for Miranda. Miranda is appreciative but leaves hurriedly shortly after this, once again not being overly affectionate toward Tucker. At the same time, Bray returns to the house to pick up his tools and has an interaction with Greg and helps him perfect an invention Greg had hoped would help their family make money. That evening at Missy's party Bobbi shows Miranda a file she got from Google that shows Bray with an invention that Miranda's dead husband, Matthew, had previously worked on, talked about and tried to patent. When Miranda confronts Bray with this information he tells her he didn't steal Matthew's invention. He tells the story of having met Matt at an engineering convention and having hit it off with him and being intrigued with some of Matthew's ideas. He tells Miranda he was in the plane next to Matt in the crash that killed him and since then he has been working to get the patent for the idea they discussed together. Miranda tells him to leave which he does.The next day a package is delivered to Miranda. It is a copy of the documents that Bray had originally intended to give Miranda several days before, before they were lost in the storm. Included is a large check for almost the exact amount of Miranda's current debt, which from reading the documents she realizes is probably the first of many to come. She meets with her children and tells them their father has managed to provide for them for a long time with his work before he died and that she couldn't be more proud of him. She also says that Tucker' proposal was a surprise so she hadn't prepared for it but now that she's had time to think she wants to know what they think. All three children express to her that she shouldn't marry Tuck because they don't think she loves him because they remember how in love she was with their father and what that looked like. They also say she should forgive Bray for not telling her upfront about knowing their dad because when Bray was around Miranda seemed happy. Later Miranda goes to the restaurant and breaks off the engagement with Tucker, returning his ring and new car. Tucker is sad but accepts this along with Miranda's resignation as restaurant manager. Later that day after returning from dinner in town with the kids, Greg spots their mailbox in a roadside pond. They retrieve it and find the documents that Bray had tried to give Miranda the day they met. It has a note in it that expresses his regrets for not having told her immediately who he was. The note also says ""Matt was a special man who loved his family dearly."" Miranda tells Bobbi and the children she plans to finish getting her nursing degree which she apparently quit to raise their family.Miranda decides to visit Bray in Tennessee but unbeknownst to her Bray has returned to Louisiana to see her on the same day. Miranda is met a Bray's door by a woman and at first it seems she will leave without saying anything, thinking the woman is a girlfriend. But Miranda decides to tell the woman ""Tell him Miranda stopped by"" at which point the woman lights up and tells her ""I'm his sister and he's in Louisiana at your house about right now."" Miranda and Bray have an all-night phone conversation as they drive back toward each other and they eventually meet at a roadside diner halfway between. Bray says meeting Bobbi at the house the night before gave him a chance to clear the air with her regarding any misunderstanding regarding ""stealing"" her son's invention. Sometime later we see Miranda's family, including Bobbi, at Bray's house at Christmas time. Bray has ostensibly left to help a neighbor fix a barn but soon after pulls into the yard pulling a horse trailer with a pony for Chloe, which she has repeatedly asked for throughout the film."

Alone, he tries to contact any space mission hoping to warn them about the situation on Earth but finds that all but one have been decommissioned. Only one mission, the space craft Æther, is still active and currently returning from Jupiter after having explored a habitable moon, K-23, which had first been discovered by Augustine. On board, the crew is unaware of the events on Earth. Augustine attempts to contact them, but the antenna is too weak for his signal to reach the ship.One night while working, Augustine finds a young girl in the station who doesn't speak. He tries to contact his previous colleagues but quickly understands they are all gone. Thanks to her drawing, he understands that her name is Iris. Reticent at first, Augustine grows fond of Iris and the two set off for another base in the Arctic hoping the antenna will be powerful enough to contact Æther. The pair face the freezing temperatures of the North Pole and a series of obstacles that cause Augustine to lose his dialysis equipment, thus condemning him to die soon. Arriving at the base, he manages to contact Æther, briefly warning them about the situation, but the crew is interrupted by a meteor strike that damages the radar and communication systems on board.To fix the ship, pregnant astronaut Sully and her partner, Commander Adewole, conduct a spacewalk with their flight engineer Maya. The team manages to fix the communications and radar but are caught in the middle of a second meteor strike that fatally injures Maya who, despite Sanchez's best efforts back on the ship, dies moments later. A broken Sully reaches out to Augustine who tells her not to come back to Earth but to instead go back to K-23 and start a new life there. Æther's pilot, Tom Mitchell, refuses, but upon discovering his wife's final words and seeing the scorched surface of the Earth, understands it is in the crew's best interests to go back to Jupiter's moon. However, he decides to use one of the space shuttles to go back to Earth hoping to find his family. Sanchez, who saw Maya as a second daughter, decides to accompany him and bury her body. The two set off back to Earth.In her final communication, Sully understands that she's speaking to Augustine Lofthouse, who was one of the reasons why she joined NASA. She thanks him, telling him her mother Jean knew him and that her full name is Iris Sullivan. Augustine realizes that Sully is in fact the daughter he had with Jean thirty years prior, and that the young Iris is merely a hallucination, an image his mind created to motivate him. Before succumbing to his illness and the radiation, Augustine tells Sully he's proud to have finally met her and Sully describes K-23 to him. Sully and Adewole, now the only survivors, set a course for K-23 where they hope to give humanity a second start."

She soon learns that the children -- Miles and Flora -- are emotionally distant and unstable. When strange events start to plague Kate and the siblings, she begins to suspect that the estate's dark corridors are home to a malevolent entity.—yusufpiskin The film begins on a dark night at a rich and lonely estate in the woods. A frightened woman tries to leave the property. She runs to her car and attempts to drive off of the plantation. From a bedroom window of the house, a little girl named Flora watches. The woman reaches the gates that lead off of the property but is stopped by a man in the darkness who grabs her by the throat.Some time after, new governess Kate accepts the proposition of watching two children on the rich plantation, Flora and Miles. She is drawn to the proposition having been an orphan herself since her father left her mother who went insane and has been living at an insane asylum ever since. Her mother spends her time alone painting indiscernible paintings. Kate says goodbye to her mother and then leaves for the estate. Once there, she is met by the cold and unfeeling housekeeper Mrs. Gross. She quickly befriends little Flora and then is told from Gross that Flora has never left the estate.

They pile up in Kate's car and leave the premises, driving away into the night.But wait- that never happened!

When students in their school begin exploding (literally), seniors Mara and Dylan struggle to survive in a world where each moment may be their last. When students in their high school begin inexplicably exploding (literally...), seniors Mara (Katherine Langford) and Dylan (Charlie Plummer) struggle to survive in a world where each moment may be their last. As an unexpected romance blossoms between them, Mara and Dylan discover that when tomorrow is no longer promised, they can finally start living for today. During a senior calculus class at Covington High, senior student Katelyn Ogden inexplicably explodes, spraying the surrounding students and classroom with blood. The police take the class into custody during an investigation, but aside from ruling out an attack, are unable to determine the cause of the explosion.During custody, senior student Mara Carlyle suggests to the class that it could happen again, a sentiment taken seriously by her peers. Afterwards, an unknown person texts her, claiming to have had a crush on her for multiple years: Mara promptly asks for the texter not to send a dick pic, to which the individual responds with a picture of Richard Nixon.Following Katelyn's funeral service, Mara gets high on mushrooms purchased from school dealers, Jenna and Joe Dalton, and goes for tea with her best friend Tess; fellow student Dylan approaches the pair and reveals himself to be the unknown texter with said crush on Mara. Dylan explains how he had begun thinking of life and how quickly it could end, and upon hearing Mara's suggestion of the incident repeating itself, realized that he needed to take action.They begin seeing one another and attend a school football game and house party, although each is cut short when a jock, Perry Love, and drink server, Cranberry Bollinger, explode, respectively, sending the attendees into a panic. Classes are cancelled for a while, and people begin to dub the explosions as ""The Covington Curse"". The incidents attract the attention of numerous government agencies, who place FBI Agent Carla Rosetti on the case; she enlists Mara and Tess as aid.While investigating the possible involvement of drugs, Mara goes for a drive with the school dealers, the Dalton twins; they explode and the car crashes. Dylan arrives and consoles a dazed Mara, before federal agents arrive in protective suits and detain them. The entire senior class is placed in observation while the government devises a ""Snooze Button"" pill to ""cure"" the students, during which multiple students explode. Realizing they should live like every day might be their last, Mara and Dylan continue seeing each other, pursuing a hedonistic lifestyle; they have sex and dance to 80s music in an old barn.School resumes for the senior class, although the townspeople begin to fear the students and Agent Rosetti inadvertently admits to Mara that the explosions may not yet be over. While demonstrating the supposed effectiveness of the pill at a school seminar, a student explodes, triggering a chain reaction of explosions in the classroom. Dozens of students explode during the ensuing rampage, whereas Mara and Dylan are separated by the mob in a struggle to escape the building. Mara exits through a side entrance with ease and reunites with Dylan, who tells her he's glad she's still here and then explodes, injuring Mara in the process.Following Dylan's death, a despondent Mara turns to alcohol, and in the ensuing weeks drunkenly falls out with her parents and Tess, as well as accidentally breaking Agent Rosetti's car window with a stolen bottle of whiskey. Mara also reads student comments online speculating that she might be the Covington Curse, as she was present at the scene of each occurring explosion. At the combined graduation/prom ceremony, Mara reconciles with Tess, who reveals that she is leaving town for a beach house that night and invites her to come. Believing herself to be the curse, Mara casually apologizes to the attendees for causing the explosions, but others chime in, claiming responsibility over circumstantial personal problems. Leaving the event, Mara visits Dylan's grave, and has a heart-to-heart conversation with his mother, who convinces her to move on with her life. Mara apologizes to her parents and sobers up.After the rampage, the next ""Snooze Button"" pill seems to be effective and the explosions stop anticlimactically, leaving 31 students in the senior class dead.

As Stanley spars to maintain academic dominance over his would-be protégé Fred, Rose attempts to dampen her own ambitions and adjust to married life while living under the roof of their fiery intellectual hosts with quicksilver loyalties and myriad neuroses.

Nine Days,2020,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10451852/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A reclusive man conducts a series of interviews with human souls for a chance to be born. Will (Winston Duke) spends his days in a remote outpost watching the live Point of View (POV) on TV's of people going about their lives, until one subject perishes, leaving a vacancy for a new life on earth. Soon, several candidates - unborn souls - arrive at Will's to undergo tests determining their fitness, facing oblivion when they are deemed unsuitable. But Will soon faces his own existential challenge in the form of free-spirited Emma (Zazie Beetz), a candidate who is not like the others, forcing him to turn within and reckon with his own tumultuous past. Fueled by unexpected power, he discovers a bold new path forward in his own life. Making his feature-film debut after a series of highly acclaimed and award-winning short films and music videos, Japanese Brazilian director Edson Oda delivers a heartfelt and meditative vision of human souls in limbo, aching to be born against unimaginable odds, yet hindered by forces beyond their will. Will is an arbiter who judges souls before they inhabit bodies in the living. He lives in an isolated house in the middle of a desert, interviewing candidate souls for the opportunity to be born; if they are not selected, Will gives them a parting memory before their existence is erased. His only company is Kyo, a soul who did not disappear, and has since assisted in Will's interviews. Will spends his days watching and taking notes on a multitude of television screens, each displaying the life of a different individual that Will has previously selected. His favorite is Amanda, a 28-year-old violin prodigy. However, on her way to a large concerto, Amanda drives too fast on the highway and crashes into an overpass, killing her. As Will grapples with Amanda's death, candidates begin arriving to interview for the vacancy Amanda left behind - a process that will take nine days. He asks the candidates simple questions about life and has them take notes on what they like or dislike about the lives of others who were chosen. Will is particularly intrigued by Emma, who displays heightened empathy and curiosity despite showing little interest in the selection process. Over the course of the nine days, most of the candidates are dismissed for various reasons, such as self-consciousness and lack of respect for suffering. Will does his best to recreate life events for the failed candidates, such as walking on the beach or bike-riding through a city, before the candidates disappear forever. Kyo invites another nearby interviewer to meet with Will, as she had previously selected Amanda's cousin for birth. She shows Will a tape shortly after Amanda's death, which reveals that Amanda left behind a suicide note before her crash. Kyo attempts to help Will get over her death, but Will continues to watch tapes from her life, unable to understand why she did it. Will has told Emma that he cannot tell her anything about his previous life, but in response to her showing concern for him, he now indicates that in his previous life he once gave a theater performance that made him feel alive, but never pursued his passion after that. He reacts angrily when another candidate, Alex, points out Will's hypocrisy for judging people's lives when he never did anything meaningful with his own life. The candidates are narrowed down to two: Emma and Kane. While Emma is carefree and sees the best in people, Kane is more pessimistic, recognizing the evil in the world and showing resolve to fight back against it. Despite Kyo recommending that Will picks Emma, he chooses Kane to be born. When Will offers Emma a last experience, she writes something down which Will says he can't do. Emma then declines a last experience and opts to walk across the desert until she disappears. Will later finds a note from Emma where she thanks him and explains she wrote happy memories she had during the interview process; Will finds them written all over the house. Feeling regret, he runs across the desert after Emma and passionately recites selections from Walt Whitman's Song of Myself, then thanks her."

When elderly mother Edna inexplicably vanishes, her daughter Kay and granddaughter Sam rush to their family's decaying country home, finding clues of her increasing dementia scattered around the house in her absence. After Edna returns just as mysteriously as she disappeared, Kay's concern that her mother seems unwilling or unable to say where she's been clashes with Sam's unabashed enthusiasm to have her grandma back. As Edna's behavior turns increasingly volatile, both begin to sense that an insidious presence in the house might be taking control of her. With RELIC, first-time writer/director Natalie Erika James crafts an unforgettable new spin on the haunted-house movie.—IFC Midnight When Edna, the demented, elderly, and widowed matriarch of the family, goes missing, her daughter Kay and granddaughter Sam travel to their remote family home to find her. They discover the house locked from the inside, and a strange black mould-like substance on an upstairs wall. Much of the furniture has been adorned with Post-it notes of reminders for Edna.That night, Sam is visited by their young neighbour Jamie, who states that he had not been to visit Edna for a while after his father had told him not to go back to the house. Sam and Kay grow increasingly disturbed by a loud creaking from inside the walls and the appearance of more black mould throughout the house; Kay experiences nightmares of a withered rotting corpse in an old shack in the woodlands.The next morning, Kay finds Edna has returned, barefoot and muddied, but unaware of her own disappearance. Following a visit from a doctor, Edna is found to be mostly of sound mind, and physically stable, with the exception of a large black bruise on her chest (resembling the mould). Kay tells Sam that she plans to move Edna into a retirement home, given her self-neglect, much to the contempt of Sam. Later that night, Kay awakes to find Edna sleepwalking toward the front door, whispering, ""It's nothing"". After being brought back to bed, Edna is convinced there is something hiding in the room and urges Kay to check under the bed; Kay sees something breathing but is distracted before she can investigate further.The next day, Sam and her grandmother share a tender moment until Edna suddenly grows cold and accuses Sam of stealing from her. She snatches the ring off of Sam's finger (not remembering that she had gifted Sam this ring) as a sinister black figure watches from the shadows. Following another violent event involving Edna, Sam visits Jamie's father Alex to ask why he stopped letting Jamie visit. Alex reveals that the last time Jamie visited, the pair played hide-and-seek; however, Edna mistakenly locked Jamie in his hiding space and left him there for hours, forgetting she had even seen him that day. Back at the house, Kay follows Edna into the garden, where she finds her tearing pages from the family photo album and frantically eating them; when Kay tries to intervene, Edna bites her and storms off, attempting to bury the album in the soil, claiming it will ""be safer there"". Fearing something may come to get her, Edna breaks down and agrees to let Kay take care of her.Sam discovers a hidden passageway to another part of the house. She enters but becomes lost as the corridor begins to loop. Disoriented and hysterical, she resorts to screaming and banging on the walls. Edna's condition seems to have worsened again; she now glares at Kay mistrustfully, refusing to eat and wetting herself. Kay notices her mother's urine is stained black. As Edna bathes, she scratches what was once her bruise: it is now rotting black flesh. The bathwater overflows and reacts with an electric heater, causing the house's power to go out. Sam travels deeper into the corridors. The ceilings slope lower, forcing her to crawl. She eventually escapes by knocking holes through the moulding walls.Kay finds Edna, much to her horror, picking at her rotting face with a knife. Kay and Sam flee into the passageway (hearing the now crazed Edna approaching). Edna, now disfigured and physically contorted, crawls toward them; she attempts to pin down Sam before being beaten down by Kay. Wheezing, the decaying Edna gestures toward a post-it note on the floor, labelled ""I AM LOVED"", and smiles. Kay realises that the walls of the house are no longer rotting and returns to her corpse-like mother to carry her to bed. She helps Edna peel away the last remnants of her hair and flesh to reveal her final form, a withered rotting corpse (like the one in her nightmare). Kay and Sam then lay on the bed with Edna until she peacefully falls asleep and presumably dies.The film ends with Sam noticing a very small black bruise on the nape of Kay's neck, resembling that of Edna's initial bruise, suggesting that in time Kay will suffer a similar fate to her mother."

Shadow in the Cloud,2020,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9691136/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A female WWII pilot traveling with top secret documents on a B-17 Flying Fortress encounters an evil presence on board the flight. On a stormy night during World War II, a female pilot with top-secret cargo talks her way on board a bomber plane about to take off. The crass all-male crew reluctantly agrees, but their suspicions about her identity and the mysterious cargo quickly grow. Just then a shadow appears in the clouds. Was it the incoming Japanese fleet or was it caused by some other sinister stowaway? In the throes of World War II, Captain Maude Garrett joins the all-male crew of a B-17 bomber with a top-secret package. Caught off-guard by the presence of a woman on a military flight, the crew tests Maude's every move. Just as her quick wit is winning them over, strange happenings and holes in her backstory incite paranoia surrounding her true mission. But this crew has more to fear: lurking in the shadows, something sinister is tearing at the heart of the plane. Trapped between an oncoming air ambush and an evil lurking within, Maude must push beyond her limits to save the hapless crew and protect her mysterious cargo.—Vertical Entertainment In August 1943, Pilot Officer Maude Garrett, a female flight officer, is assigned to travel with a top secret package from Auckland, New Zealand, to Samoa. When she arrives at the airbase, she sees a ground crew ramp worker disappear before her eyes-just before suddenly finding herself standing right in front of her transport, a B-17 bomber called The Fool's Errand. The bomber's crew gives her a mostly derisive welcome and she is quartered in the Sperry Ball turret for the takeoff. With no room left for her document valise, she reluctantly allows the only crew member friendly to her, Staff Sergeant Walter Quaid, to store it.While stuck in the turret, Maude sees some sort of creature clinging to the underside of the bomber's wing. She reports it, but most of the crew-except Private Beckell, who sees it too-dismisses her. When she is allowed to leave the turret, the hatch malfunctions, trapping her inside. When she reacts indignantly to the crew's comments about her situation, they abandon their attempts to open the hatch and the comm is cut off. After seeing a Japanese fighter appearing and disappearing close to the bomber, she is abruptly attacked by the creature, a gremlin; she fights it off but ends up injured. When the crew contacts her again to ask what happened, a radio message comes in telling them that a Maude Garrett doesn't exist and is not registered for the flight. When they intend to take her out for questioning, Maude deliberately jams the turret's gears and prepares to defend herself when the Japanese aircraft reappears and attacks. Taking control of the turret, she shoots it down, winning the crew's grudging respect.While continuing to talk with the crew, Maude admits she is actually married and boarded the bomber under her maiden name, but refuses to reveal her mission, citing its secrecy. Then she sees the gremlin again as it continues to sabotage the bomber. Eventually Private Dorn sights it too, but the others disregard him. Suspecting Maude's assignment is the cause of their misfortunes, Reeves gives the order to open the bag, which contains a baby-Maude's and Quaid's extramarital child. Forced to confess, Maude explains that she was severely mistreated by her husband; she has an affair with Quaid and inadvertently got pregnant. Someone betrayed her to her husband, who came to the base. Deciding not to tell Quaid, Maude faked her assignment to get away from her husband, who she says would have killed her in his rage.Just as Captain Reeves turns back to the airbase, three Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighters attack and the gremlin boards the bomber, injures Quaid and kidnaps the baby. When the gremlin appears before her with the baby in the bag, Maude exits the turret and fires her handgun at it, driving it off but leaving the bag hanging precariously from the engine nacelle. Risking a perilous climb, Maude retrieves her child and reboards the aircraft through the opening for the ball turret, which has been shot off. The gremlin attacks again, throwing Technical Sergeant Taggart out of the aircraft before Maude can evict it. When Reeves, Lieutenant Finch and Dorn are killed by Japanese gunfire, Maude takes command and brings the bomber roughly but safely down to the ground. The gremlin reappears and tries to snatch the baby once more but Maude catches up and finally kills it. She and the other survivors watch as The Fool's Errand burns and explodes.(copied from Wikipedia)"

Antebellum,2020,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10065694/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Successful author Veronica Henley finds herself trapped in a horrifying reality and must uncover the mind-bending mystery before it's too late. The film starts on what appears to be an 1800's era antebellum plantation. Confederate troops led by a man named Jasper (Jack Huston) bring in a few runaway slaves. One of them, Amara (Achok Majak), runs away again in terror after watching the other men strap a device to another slave, Eli (Tongayi Chirisa). Jasper chases after Amara on horseback and brings her down by lassoing a noose around her neck. She begs to be killed instead of returned to the antebellum, and Jasper obliges her by shooting her in the head.One of the captured women, Eden (Janelle Monae), is brought into the home of her owner, a Confederate general known only as ""Him"" (Eric Lange). He beats Eden and orders her to say her name. When she cannot, Him grabs a branding iron and burns it into her back, causing her to scream in agony before weakly crying out her name.Six weeks later, a new group of black people are brought in to the plantation. Jasper orders the group to not speak unless they are given permission. Jasper's wife Elizabeth (Jena Malone) brings her daughter (Arabella Landrum) to pick one of the women in the group, whom the little girl names Julia (Kiersey Clemons). When Eden takes Julia with her, she asks Eden where they are and what is happening, but Eden tells her to keep quiet.Eli goes to Eden's house later to ask when they can escape again, but Eden appears to have given up hope. She walks carefully across the floor to see which boards do not make noises when stepped on. Julia then goes to her home, where she seems to already know who Eden really is. She wants to try and escape as well, as she is pregnant, but Eden shows her the branding scar to show that it is better not to anger the people in charge. Julia expresses disappointment in Eden, saying she is not a leader.The slaves are forced to work during a gathering of Him and his troops, where he boasts about preserving their way of life for the future. Two young soldiers, Purcell (T.C. Matherne) and Daniel (Robert Aramayo), observe Julia, and Daniel expresses attraction toward her. Purcell encourages him to speak to her, and Jasper comes in and orders Julia to wait in Daniel's cabin. When Daniel goes to find her later, Julia tries to appeal to what she thinks is his innocent nature since he appeared to be kinder than the other men, but he proves to be just as terrible when he strikes Julia for speaking to him without permission. He kicks her in the stomach before leaving.The next day on the plantation, Julia suffers a miscarriage. She cries out in pain and distress, and Eden goes to help her. Jasper attempts to antagonize them, but Eli keeps him back briefly by calling him a cracker. After letting Eden help Julia, Jasper confronts Eli over the matter, with the other soldiers getting ready to fire if they need to, but he instead sends Eli to clean out the shed. There, he finds the burnt remains of Amara, which he recognizes from her cross necklace. Eli breaks down.That night, Eden tries to sleep. She starts to hear what sounds like a cell phone ringing. She then appears to wake up from what seemed like a bad dream. Here, Eden is revealed to be an author and activist named Veronica Henley, married to Nick (Marque Richardson) with a daughter, Kennedi (London Boyce), all of whom live in present day Atlanta, Georgia. Veronica is well noted for speaking out against the treatment of black Americans, causing her to butt heads with pundits. As she is preparing for an upcoming trip, she sits to have a video conference with another woman... and it's Elizabeth. She uses condescendingly racist dialogue while discussing Veronica's book and its themes. Elizabeth also describes herself as a ""talent scout"" while noticing Kennedi, which makes Veronica uncomfortable.After going off on her trip, Veronica meets up with one of her best friends, Dawn (Gabourey Sidibe), as she visits Veronica's hotel room. She expresses to Dawn some of her frustrations and insecurities with her home life. After Dawn leaves, a mysterious man arrives to bring Veronica flowers but won't say who they are from. Based on the note that's left, she assumes they're from Nick.Veronica steps out of her room and runs into her other close friend Sarah (Lily Cowles), who is joining her and Dawn later that night for dinner and drinks. Meanwhile, Elizabeth sneaks into Veronica's room, tries on her lipstick, and walks around the room to observe before turning the tag on her door so she won't get turn-down service. Veronica then attends a conference where she speaks before an audience of black women, all of whom are moved and inspired by her words. As she goes back up to her room, the girl that appeared to be Elizabeth's daughter is in the elevator with her and creepily tells her she shouldn't speak unless given permission, but Veronica thinks it's just a game.Veronica later joins Dawn and Sarah. On the ride to the restaurant, Veronica talks to Nick and thanks him for the flowers, but he says it must have been a fan. Dawn is abrasive toward the staff since she demands the best table and wine. During the night, an unseen man (implied to be Jasper) watches the women all night until he sends a vodka cranberry to Dawn. He then approaches her personally to compliment her, and while flattered, she takes the time to critique his attempt, since she thinks that drink pales in comparison to the wine they are celebrating with, but she gives the man her number just in case. The ladies then prepare to part ways, with Veronica heading into an Uber. Midway through the trip, Veronica gets a call from a woman who says she is her driver waiting outside the restaurant, but she thinks there's a mistake. Veronica then looks at the driver to see that it's Elizabeth. Jasper then appears from behind her to grab her. Veronica struggles to break free, but he ultimately knocks her out.Veronica wakes up back on the plantation, where she is still hearing the phone ring. Outside, Him - actually Senator Blake Denton - answers the phone and speaks to someone over how Nick has been all over the news with Kennedi searching for Veronica, and he promises to take care of it. Veronica pretends to be asleep while Denton says he won't let anyone take her away from him.The next day, Veronica finds that Julia has hung herself. In her despair, she decides that tonight will be the night that they escape. She waits until Denton has fallen asleep, and she manages to sneak outside quietly. Eli finds her and helps her get the cell phone to call for help. They try to make it to the cabin to get a signal, but Purcell and Daniel are out after drinking, forcing the other two to hide and drop the phone. Daniel picks it up, and after Purcell leaves, he stops to urinate. Eli cracks him in the face and leaves Daniel to choke on his blood while they get the phone. They try to make it to the cabin, but Denton attacks the two of them. A fight ensues with Eli hitting Denton to keep him off Veronica, but Denton kills Eli with a hatchet. Veronica hits Denton with a tea kettle before getting his phone. Denton steps out but Veronica stabs him in the gut with a bayonet. She unlocks his phone and manages to call Nick and let him know she is alive, and she sends him a location pin to give to the police. Veronica then goes to Eli's body and addresses him by his real name, Professor Tarasai.Veronica rolls Denton into a confederate flag and brings him to the shed. He weakly tells her that there will still be more like them, but she scoffs at him. As she goes to get a torch, Jasper finds her, but she tells him that Denton is hurt. Jasper and another guard run into the shed, where Veronica locks them in there and sets the logs on fire to burn all three of them to death. She then rides on horseback as the other soldiers give chase through the woods. After losing most of them, Elizabeth pursues Veronica on her horse. She taunts Veronica and states that Denton (who was really her father) personally picked Veronica because she went against his whole campaign and agenda, while Elizabeth picked everyone else herself. Veronica lassos a noose around Elizabeth's neck, but Elizabeth slashes at Veronica multiple times until Veronica gains the upper hand and beats Elizabeth's face. Veronica then rides the horse while pulling Elizabeth until she slams her head against a statue, breaking her neck.Veronica continues to ride as the sun rises and the soldiers continue their re-enacting. She rides outside the gates of the plantation, where it's revealed that Antebellum is a Civil War re-enactment park. Veronica rides out on her horse to find other people, just as the police arrive, and she appears relieved. The police and feds rescue the kidnapped black people and bulldoze Antebellum to the ground."

Elsa and Santiago explained that the victim whose body was stolen from when Bretnik was a detective, as well as Zoe, were both embedded with microchips.Bretnik, Elsa, and Santiago planned to assassinate the inventor of the microchips, Victor Canton (David Gibson), who was on a rare visit to Wander. Sheriff Santiago met with the inventor alongside the men from the Jeep at the garage, and then Elsa and Bretnik moved to ambush them. Elsa shot the others, including Sheriff Santiago, before allowing Bretnik to get revenge on the inventor for the deaths of his family and Cleats; Bretnik shot the inventor multiple times, killing him. Elsa then told Bretnik to clear the data of the computer inside the garage before leaving. Upon exiting the garage, Bretnik was promptly apprehended by Agent Cassidy.However, Shelly informs Bretnik that the medication he takes for his mental trauma causes anxiety and delusions, and tells him that the garage was fully derelict and empty, the morgue he investigated and found bodies in was not in use for years, and that Cleats' decapitated body was located in Bretnik's car. Bretnik, unable to believe whether his turn of events was true or if the entire investigation was simply a delusion, as well as faced with the possibility that he killed his friend, breaks down.Bretnik is placed in a holding cell awaiting placement in a mental institution. He is met in his cell by Elsa and an alive-and-well Cleats. They explain to Bretnik that the entire investigation was part of their plan: Bretnik was being used all along as a way to tie up loose ends. Bretnik's mental state allowed them to ensure he would continue to investigate, and allow them to pin any blame on the events in Wander on him.In the mental facility, Bretnik barricades himself in his room and digs in his chest with the point of a pen he'd stolen from a nurse. As he lies on the floor bleeding, he laughs and smiles; in his hand is his own microchip, proving his earlier fears that he himself had a microchip placed in him after the accident that killed his daughter.Meanwhile, the envelope Bretnik mailed earlier had been sent to Shelly. Inside the envelope is all of the evidence and photographs Bretnik took of the laboratory in the basement of the garage, which could allow the conspiracy to be exposed.(copied from Wikipedia)"

But everything changes when she befriends a free-spirited girl from a mysterious tribe rumored to transform into wolves by night. In a time of superstition and magic, when wolves are seen as demonic and nature an evil to be tamed, a young apprentice hunter, ROBYN, comes to Ireland with her father to wipe out the last pack. But when Robyn saves a wild native girl, MEBH, their friendship leads her to discover the world of the WOLFWALKERS.—Someone Bounding with spirit with her lupine siblings through the impenetrable enchanted forest of 1650 Kilkenny, the young wolf-walker, Mebh, fears that the fragile treaty between humans and her pack is about to be broken. Troubled by her mother's unaccountable disappearance, and the rapid diminishing of her natural habitat, reluctantly, feral Mebh strikes up a friendship with rebellious, bright-eyed Robyn, unbeknownst to her that her father, Bill Goodfellowe, is a great English wolf-hunter. Now, appointed by the walled city's fiercely devout, wolf-hating Lord Protector, Bill has two short days to eradicate the wolf menace, and rid the neighbouring woods, the last stronghold of evil, of the savage beasts. But, free-spirited Robyn yearns to be free, and for the first time in a long while, she feels alive. Can she have the best of both worlds?—Nick Riganas In 1650 Ireland, the residents of the town of Kilkenny are attempting to clear the neighboring woods for farming as per the orders of the authoritative Lord Protector Oliver Cromwell, putting them at odds with a pack of wolves living within them. Hunter Bill Goodfellowe and his young rebellious daughter Robyn have been summoned from England to Kilkenny by the Lord Protector to help exterminate the wolves so the woodcutters can continue their work unimpeded. Disliking the confining nature of Kilkenny and wanting to help Bill, Robyn decides to sneak out of the town one day to follow him along with her pet falcon, Merlin. After accidentally shooting Merlin with her crossbow after trying to kill a wolf attacking a shepherd and his flock, Robyn watches as a mysterious girl takes Merlin with her back into the woods with the retreating wolves. The Lord Protector scolds Robyn for not working in his scullery and gives Bill two days to kill the wolves.As she is escorted back to Kilkenny by the Lord Protector's guards, Robyn manages to sneak away back into the woods, where she finds Merlin has miraculously healed. She is then approached by a young wolf, causing her to stumble into a trap. As the wolf attempts to free Robyn, she attempts to attack it, causing the wolf to bite her on the arm. Merlin and the wolf lead Robyn back to the wolves' den, where she discovers that the wolf is the same mysterious girl from earlier. The girl, Mebh, calls herself a ""wolfwalker"" and she magically heals Robyn's wound ""before it's too late."" As Mebh and the other wolves lead Robyn out of the den and woods, the two girls get to know more about each other, and they quickly bond over their desires for freedom. Robyn also learns that Mebh's mother, Moll, also a wolfwalker, has not yet returned in her search for a new home for her pack. Robyn tries to convince Bill about the existence of wolfwalkers and her plans for a nonviolent way to rid the woods of the wolves, but Bill ignores her, upset over her disobedience of the Lord Protector's orders.The next morning, while working her first day in the scullery, she is drawn into the Lord Protector's chambers by a mysterious voice as well as the wolfwalker magic residing in her bitten arm, discovering a large concealed cage, though is quickly ushered out by the head maid. That night, while she sleeps, Robyn finds her soul has left her body and transformed into a wolf, thus making her a wolfwalker herself, forcing her to flee Kilkenny. Returning to woods, Mebh is ecstatic to learn of Robyn's transformation, and she helps Robyn get accustomed to her new form, including her heightened sense of smell, sound, and speed.Upon returning to Kilkenny, Robyn attempts to return to her human body, but is drawn to the presence of another wolfwalker, suspecting it to be Moll. After evading the frightened townspeople, Bill amongst them, Robyn manages to infiltrate the Lord Protector's manor, where she finds Moll. Despite assuring her that Mebh is unharmed, Moll tells Robyn to instruct Mebh to leave the woods with the pack, as it is no longer safe for them there. Unable to free Moll but able to evade the Lord Protector, Robyn manages to return to her human form just as Bill returns home, though the Lord Protector and the rabid townspeople arrive shortly after. The Lord Protector gives Bill one last chance to rid the forest of the wolves lest he be demoted as a foot soldier in his army, and he assures the townspeople that he can tame the wolf that he's captured, and by extension, nature itself. Robyn's pleas to let Moll go and declaring her a wolfwalker fall on deaf ears, the Lord Protector deeming it ""pagan nonsense.""Fearing separation from each other, Robyn and Bill tend to their usual duties. Mebh, waiting for Robyn to return on a promise from the previous night, infiltrates Kilkenny herself and searches for her mother. She finds Robyn, who attempts to relay Moll's message about taking the pack and leaving with them, but Mebh, hurt by Robyn's refusal to help rescue her mother, resolves to do so alone. Mebh and Robyn then watch as the Lord Protector presents a muzzled and chained Moll to the townspeople. An enraged Mebh storms the stage and attempts to free her, and when Bill tries to restrain her, Moll breaks the muzzle and bites him on the arm. After placing Moll back into the cage, Mebh is forced to flee, but not before promising to return with her pack to rescue her mother. The Lord Protector orders Bill to kill Moll before he joins him and his army to wage war on the wolves. Robyn protects Moll from Bill before freeing her and reuniting her with Mebh before she and her pack can attack Kilkenny, earning Mebh's forgiveness.Bill arrives and shoots Moll in the chest, fearful for Robyn's safety, though he witnesses Moll's wolf form turning into a spirit and leaving to return to her human form in the den, Mebh and the wolves following it. Robyn transforms into her wolf form and follows them just as the Lord Protector and his army arrive and begin razing the forest. As Mebh works on trying to heal a grievously wounded Moll, she sends her pack to follow Robyn, who leads them to attack and hold the army back to prevent them from reaching Mebh and Moll. Mebh summons Robyn and her pack back, realizing she needs them present in order to heal Moll, though Robyn is caught in the blast of a cannon ball attack, causing her to get left behind. Robyn thwarts another cannon attack aimed at the den, but is injured as a result. Before the Lord Protector can kill her, Bill, due to Moll's bite, becomes a wolfwalker and attacks the Lord Protector in his wolf form. Bill, with help from Robyn in her human form, overpowers the Lord Protector and holds him over the edge of a cliff above a waterfall. The Lord Protector resigns to his fate and willingly plunges himself into the jagged rocks below.Robyn and Bill manage to return to the den where they both help Mebh and the pack revive Moll, who invites Bill and Robyn to stay with them and embrace their new identities as wolfwalkers. Robyn, Mebh, Bill, and Moll then travel with their pack to find a new home, riding in a wagon drawn by the Lord Protector's horse. Bill puts a flower in Moll's hair and Mebh and Robyn fall asleep in the back, their wolf forms running around the wagon."

Happiest Season,2020,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8522006/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A holiday romantic comedy that captures the range of emotions tied to wanting your family's acceptance, being true to yourself, and trying not to ruin Christmas. Meeting your girlfriend's family for the first time can be tough. Planning to propose at her family's annual Christmas dinner--until you realize that they don't even know that she's gay--is even harder. When Abby (Kristen Stewart) learns that Harper (Mackenzie Davis) has kept their relationship a secret from her family, she begins to question the girlfriend she thought she knew. Abby Holland (Kristen Stewart) and Harper Caldwell (Mackenzie Davis) are a couple who have been dating nearly a year. Abby dislikes Christmas since her parents passed away a few year earlier, so Harper spontaneously invites Abby to celebrate the holidays with her family in her hometown of Pittsburgh. Abby sees this as the perfect opportunity to introduce herself to Harper's parents and propose to her on Christmas morning. However, on their way to the Caldwells' house, Harper reveals she lied to Abby about coming out to her parents; fearing doing so would interfere with her father's campaign for mayor, she doesn't want to come out to her family until after Christmas. She asks Abby to pretend to be her straight roommate for the holiday, to which Abby reluctantly agrees.At the Caldwells' house, Abby meets Harper's father, Ted (Victor Garber), her perfectionist mother, Tipper (Mary Streenburgen), and her wacky younger sister, Jane (Mary Holland). The family welcomes Abby as Harper's ""orphan friend"" who has nowhere else to go for Christmas. Abby quickly becomes uncomfortable, especially when she meets Harper's exes, boyfriend Connor (Jake McDorman) and girlfriend Riley (Aubrey Plaza). During the visit, she begins questioning how much she knows about her girlfriend when she sees Ted and Tipper's high expectations and Harper's competitive relationship with her older sister, Sloane (Alison Brie).Meanwhile, Ted is trying to impress a possible donor from the city council to contribute to his campaign, which Abby unwillingly jeopardizes when Sloane's children put an unpaid necklace into her bag at the mall and she is caught with it. Believing she is a shoplifter, Ted and Tipper think it might be better if they keep Abby away from upcoming social events. From this point, Abby feels even more like an outsider. She also learns from Riley that Harper denied her sexuality ever since she was a high school freshman during their romantic time together, which makes Abby more worried about the future of their relationship.At the Caldwells' annual Christmas Eve party, Abby, having grown tired of her current situation, is relieved when her friend John (Daniel Levy) arrives unannounced to pick her up. Harper privately begs Abby to stay and as they are about to kiss, they are caught by Sloane who prepares to expose their relationship to the family. However, it turns out, Sloane has a secret of her own: she and her husband, Eric (Burl Moseley), are getting a divorce. The sisters get into a public fight, ruining the party. Sloane reveals in front of the guests that Harper is a lesbian and in a relationship with Abby..... which Harper denies immediately. Heartbroken by this, Abby leaves the house. John follows Abby outside, where the two talk about their stories of coming out to their respective families: Abby's parents were loving and accepting, while John's bigoted and homophobic father threw him out of the house and publicly disowned him forever. John reminds her that coming out can be terrifying for gay people, but has nothing to do with Harper's love for her.After realizing that her fear of rejection by her parents caused her to hurt Riley and will cause her to lose Abby, Harper finally tells the truth to her parents, confirming that she is a lesbian. Predictably, both Ted and Tipper do not react well to this news. This inspires Sloane to reveal her own secret that she and her husband are getting divorced, and even Jane tells her parents how neglected she felt throughout the years. Harper goes after Abby to apologize, confessing that she truly loves her and wants to build a life with her. Touched by her words, Abby forgives her and they share a long and passionate kiss.Ted apologizes to his daughters for making them feel they always had to be perfect. Then he gets a phone call from the donor he's been trying to impress, who will support him only if Harper stays quiet about her personal life. Ted rejects the offer. The Caldwells then take a family picture, with Abby included this time.One year later, Abby and Harper are now engaged, Jane has become a bestselling author with her fantasy novel, 'The Shadow Dreamers', and Ted has won the mayoral election. On Christmas Eve, the family goes to the local retro cinema to watch 'It's a Wonderful Life'. As the movie starts, Abby and Harper smile at each other lovingly."

During a bank robbery, Rex, a fella with the habit of talking to himself/conscience, takes down the robbers and after several gunshots, he successfully secures the entire establishment but unfortunately the whole successful mission ends in a tragic way for which he is tried and imprisoned. After doing his time, he moves to Finland for a break but gets trapped by a twisted cannibal family with a very dark secret.—Fella_shibby@yahoo.com Rex (Ben O'Toole), a veteran and resident of Boise, Idaho visits a Boise bank to see a teller named Maddy that he has a crush on. He purposefully manipulates the bank's line so that when Maddy is available he is able to speak with her. While Rex is flirting and asking Maddy out on a date, a group of armed robbers storm the bank and demand both the register tills and all of the customers' purses and wallets. Rex instructs Maddy to run and prepares to hand over his wallet. Another customer's spit open purse reveals a firearm which Rex debates using to defend himself as well as the bank customers and employees.Flashback sequences reveal that Rex was able to successfully secure the bank by dispatching the armed robbers one at a time. Unfortunately, an innocent bystander was killed in the process. The reception of Rex's actions is split down the line believing him to either be a hero who saved the day or a rogue vigilante who caused an unnecessary death. Rex goes back and forth with his attorney before his trial, where he can either take a plea deal and serve 8 years in prison or try and prove his innocence but serve 20 to life if he is found guilty. Rex takes the plea deal and serves 8 years in prison.Upon being released, the media has a field day with Rex's actions in the bank and follow him obsessively while he enjoys some small luxuries of freedom like grocery shopping and eating a burger. He then returns to the bar where he was previously employed and speaks with another bartender. They banter back and forth and Rex explains that he has made a calculated decision to get away to Finland. The calculated decision turns out to be shooting a spitwad at a map in his cell, where the spitwad landed on Finland.Rex is shown at the airport being adorned by an obnoxious fan who compares him to Batman. He is also uncomfortably stared at by an elderly Finnish couple who mention something in Finnish about capturing him. Another Finnish passenger who overheard the couple sidles up to Rex and whispers their ominous conversation to him. Brushing this off as coincidence, Rex boards his flight, realizing that the airport codes for Boise to Helsinki, Finland are Boi to Hel (Boy to Hell), but boards his flight anyway. Upon landing, he quickly enters a taxi but during the journey sleeping gas fills the back seat. Rex then awakens in a basement turned torture chamber with one of his legs amputated at the knee and his hands bound to the ceiling. He works with his conscience, a physical manifestation of himself that only he can see and hear, to deduce as much information about his predicament as possible. Rex and his conscience quickly discern that Rex is being held captive by a family as there are lots of various toys around the room, however, Rex is unable to escape his binds. The audience learns that Rex is in the basement of a large family estate in rural Finland.A young boy from the family holding Rex captive is wandering around the house and enters the basement to find Rex being held hostage. Rex's conscience tells him that he can hold the boy (we learn his name is Olaf) hostage as an insurance policy to be set free from the family. Olaf is wielding a small knife and debates freeing Rex; however, Rex quickly incapacitates and traps Olaf between his legs despite being held captive. Olaf's older sister Alia then goes searching for Olaf and she finds Rex holding Olaf captive. Rex negotiates with Alia to free him in exchange for not killing Olaf. Before any kind of deal can be negotiated, Rex loses his hold on Olaf and Alia is able to retreat with a wounded Olaf upstairs. The family then needs to take Olaf to the hospital to receive medical attention, as Olaf is completely unconscious. Alia then explains that Olaf was injured falling out of bed to protect Rex. She then fantasizes about a wedding to Rex and comes back downstairs to clean and dress his wound, professing her affection for Rex.Alia explains that her family, particularly her eldest brother Pati, are cannibals who will eat Rex piece by piece (explaining his missing leg) until there is nothing left. A flashback shows that Pati has craved human flesh since birth and his family tried a number of other options but finally the family gave in and started killing American travelers and feeding them to Pati. Alia has always been an outcast from her family, perpetually disturbed by their murderous and cannibalistic behavior. She tried to escape many times, once with her younger brother. Alas, the attempts were always unsuccessful with her being captured and returned to the family. As punishment, Alia was forced to feed and tend to Pati, though she explains that she was constantly looking for a chance to escape. Despite Alia's fear of her family, she refuses to help Rex escape as she is confident that Rex cannot stop her family. Rex and Alia bond over their traumatic pasts, and Alia leaves Rex with a small knife to cut his ropes.Meanwhile, the rest of the family returns from the hospital. A doctor's diagnosis ruled out Olaf's nose injury as being from a simple fall so they know that Alia lied to them. Rex is unable to cut himself loose before being injected by the father of the family and loses consciousness. While he is unconscious, a flashback is shown recounting the events that took place during the bank robbery. When presented with the firearm in the bank, Rex is told by his conscience to 'kill them all' referring to the robbers. He quickly dispatches one robber with the handgun he has found then trades up for a shotgun and dispatches the other robbers. Simultaneously we are shown that the bank's cameras were turned into YouTube videos with views that accumulate into the millions. Rex dispatches 3 of the 4 robbers when the final robber takes a hostage, however, Rex is able to release all of the other hostages. The flashback then shows the trial, explaining one opinion that Rex was reckless and led to the death of a bystander named Angela. However, Rex explains that the robbers were violent without provocation and likely would have hurt someone else. The flashback then shows Rex in a stand-off with the final robber who was holding his crush Maddy hostage. He negotiates for Maddy's release and despite being free and clear, Rex shoots the final robber in the groin (per his conscience's advice). The robber fires off a stray round that goes through a door, killing Angela, a bystander hiding behind the door. In another flashback, Maddy visits Rex in prison asking to be left alone so that she can recover from the trauma she experienced. Rex is then shown talking to his cellmate in prison who explains that he cannot outrun his problems. Rex is shown having actually shot 3 spitwads at the map when deciding where to live, each one landing on Finland.Rex awakens to find Uncle Arto starting to saw off his remaining leg, however, Rex is able to unsheath the knife from Alia and stab Uncle in the head, killing him, before the operation is complete. Rex then is able to free himself and begins searching the basement for objects he can improvise into weapons, finding a flare gun, a large knife, and other various items he can improvise into weapons. Rex and his conscience debate whether to save Alia or not before escaping with Rex seeming reluctant to try and help another woman when it ended tragically last time. He approaches the front door of the house and the scene cuts away to the remainder of the family returning from the hospital.The family debates fleeing should the authorities show up and ultimately explaining they will search for Rex and find him or he will most likely die in the surrounding woods. While debating the course of action, Father and one of the older twin brothers are shot by an unseen Rex, quickly revealed to be hiding under a table. He is able to dispatch the entire family with the help of Alia, via the nail-gun, knives, and Alia strangling her mother. However, Pati is still alive. He is revealed to be a grotesque giant that becomes enraged by the death of his family. Rex attempts to shoot Pati with the flare gun but is unsuccessful. In his battle with Pati, Rex finds his severed lower leg in the family's refrigerator with the jagged leg bone still intact. While being grappled by Pati, Rex is able to jam the foot and sharp bone into Pati's throat, killing him. Alia explains they are now safe. Rex is praised by his conscience who ultimately realizes he is no longer needed and disappears. Alia and Rex discuss recovering Olaf from the hospital and are later shown as a couple back in the United States with Rex explaining to his friends at a party how they met. Alia turns out to be potentially psychotic when a woman at the party puts her hand on Rex's arm and Alia imagines herself killing the woman with a meat cleaver.

A girl in the backseat with two guys. She is terrified as one of the guys reaches for her, implying she might be taken against her will.The scene shifts to years later where Emma is taking a long drive to the middle of nowhere to a vacation house. Emma is being driven by Joe, a chatty driver who is also very inquisitive about her. Emma keeps to herself and jots down notes in her notebook. He keeps calling her Mrs Barret and wonders why she isn't accompanied by her husband on this long road trip.When Emma comes to the house, she makes sure to use all the security locks and then puts on music and dances in skimpy clothes while drinking wine. Someone knocks on the door and Emma finds a dozen roses at the doorstep. She takes them and then goes inside to dance and spills her wine. She bends down and is sober enough to notice that the wine puddle is weird around the counter. Before she can investigate, there is a knock on the door. It is her husband Henry who was supposed to come the next day.
It is revealed that the couple is here to celebrate their wedding anniversary.Henry asks about her journey here to which Emma tells him she isn't good with keeping her things safe and left her notebook behind in the car. Henry tells her she needs to get on with the times and use a laptop where all her notes can be backed up. They get comfortable and Henry pours Emma some whiskey. After drinking that, Emma is unable to connect the charger and starts feeling dizzy. She can't get into her bed either and Henry has to help her with everything. She falls into bed just as Henry, too, complains of feeling weird.Emma thinks she has a nightmare of random images and is being injected with something. It is when she wakes up that things turn creepy. She finds two mugs of coffee on the bedside table with a note. She ignores it at first and turns around to cuddle with her husband. Then suddenly she gets up when she realizes what she's wearing is not the one she wore to bed in the night. She wakes up Henry to tell him that she is wearing a far better nightgown than the one she was wearing when she had gone to sleep. Henry doesn't think anything of it at first and wants to continue sleeping. But Emma doesn't allow him anymore sleep and keeps poking him until he gets fed up and gets up. He too realizes something weird is going on when he sees that the clothes in the wardrobe definitely don't belong to him.They wonder what could be going on and decide to get out of the house. But they soon find the doors locked and a voice informs them that they are trapped and must do as told. First things first, both of them must change into outfits from the fifties. The next order is that Henry must open the door for Emma at all times and she must smile and say thanks every time.The couple does as told because disobedience causes electricity jolts to their heads. Apparently, they have something inserted behind the ear that causes a buzz to go up to their heads. The next order is for Emma to cook dinner in the kitchen while Henry has to bring a laptop and sit near his wife while she cooks. There is no WiFi, and Emma keeps chopping asparagus over and over while Henry is instructed to read from the only folder on the computer. He finds a text message exchanged between Emma and her lover, Ryan.Henry gets upset and wants to leave but a buzz in his head, sets him straight. Emma apologizes and assures Henry that her affair is over but Henry is still upset. The Voice instructs the couple have a happy celebratory dinner and so forces them to have their meal and then go into their rooms and be intimate with each other. While Henry is following orders, Emma refrains herself by pushing her husband away, clearly not enjoying herself. Henry suddenly stops saying he cannot do it.The Voice isn't too happy that the romance he's planned for the couple is going awry. He punishes Henry by sending another electric shock up his ear. Emma desperately pleads that she would do whatever it takes for the Voice to stop punishing her husband but the Voice isn't interested in seeing the couple be intimate anymore. Later Henry asks Emma why she didn't ask him to stop.Emma recalls the incident from the beginning of the movie and says she finds it better to remain quiet rather than say anything.
Henry keeps promising Emma that he will get them out of this mess. Just then Joe comes by to return Emma's notebook.The couple tries to signal to him for help but the house is apparently sound-proofed. Emma gets the idea to use a flashlight on the peephole. Joe sees it and Henry is evidently not too pleased by this. Joe tries to jump over only to be pulled back by the masked man and beaten.Emma is upset but then realizes that there has only been one guy speaking to them and that if he is outside they have enough time to look for another escape. Again Henry doesn't seem too pleased. He is trying to show concern and wariness of the danger.
Emma thinks there might be a way out through the counter where she had spilled wine. Henry helps her and a Crawlspace is revealed. Emma jumps right in while Henry keeps telling her it is a bad idea. Emma goes in but can't see a way out.Meanwhile, Henry is knocked out and the masked man pulls Emma out and then injects her. Emma awakens to find herself wearing a different dress of an outdated fashion. But she has a surprise waiting for her in the living room. It's Ryan, tied to a chair. The Voice commands that she mend her marriage by killing Ryan. She refuses and the Voice tortures Henry by sending an electric pulse up his head. Emma is told that either Ryan should die or Henry will be killed by electric pulse. She chooses to kill Ryan and stabs him because he isn't over her and keeps trying to contact her. Emma has now made sure Ryan doesn't contact her again.Later she is in her bedroom, clearly devastated for having to kill her lover. Henry consoles her by handing her a glass of whiskey and then walks away. Emma recalls how the alcohol must be spiked causing them both to lose consciousness on the first night. She tries to call Henry but then realizes the cameras are watching her. She pretends to drink from the glass but actually pours it under the bedside table on to the rug.Emma then pretends to lose consciousness while the masked man comes to check up on her. When he leaves, Emma decides to get some investigating done and finds a secret entrance through the wardrobe of outdated fashions. She finds a glass of whiskey and monitors everywhere and leafless trees as icons.She turns on the TV that looks like it belongs from the fifties but actually plays recordings from this era. She discovers that a cult called the Eden Group has formed an organization offering services to correct wives. The Eden Group promises husbands that their wives will learn to behave and smile, cook dinners, and bear them children exactly like in the olden days.Emma finds a video of Henry tossing out his whiskey on the first night and then changing Emma's clothes but not before he has his way with her against her will. Emma is heartbroken and when she hears a noise, she grabs the car keys and goes back to the bedroom to pretend to be unconscious. The masked man and Henry take Emma to the car and Henry points out that he wasn't given the right car keys.While they are away, Emma jumps into the front seat and then remembers that if she tried to escape, an electronic pulse will be sent to her head. She uses the key to remove the control from behind her ear and is about to turn on the car when the masked man appears. Emma leaves the car and run into the fields where she manages to use a shovel to defend herself and kill the man.Henry arrives and Emma pretends to have just woken up and been attacked by the man. Henry almost believes her but sees a trail of blood from her ear and realizes Emma has removed the control device and must have learned the truth. He makes excuses for Emma to enter the house and then attacks her, claiming to have done everything for her. Emma isn't too impressed with this gesture and injects him with another device. Then using the watch she stole from the head of the Eden Group (the masked man), she sends a strong electric vibration up Henry's head until his brain is fried.Emma leaves the house in the car and stops in the middle of the road after seeing car crashed against a tree.
We see Emma driving peacefully, while Joe awakens in the back seat and thanks Mrs Barret to which she replies to just call her Emma. (thanks to darkhorrortales)"

An American Pickle,2020,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9059704/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"An immigrant worker at a pickle factory is accidentally preserved for 100 years and wakes up in modern-day Brooklyn. A simple Jewish man named Herschel Greenbaum works in a pickle factory in Brooklyn. One day he falls into a vat of brine and stays there, perfectly preserved, for 100 years. He comes back to life and goes to stay with his great-great-grandson, Ben, in contemporary Brooklyn.—Anonymous It's 1919, and Herschel Greenbaum (Seth Rogen) is a struggling but upbeat laborer who immigrates to America determined to build a bright future for his beloved, growing family. One day, while working at his factory job, Herschel falls into a vat of pickles...where he's trapped for 100 years. Luckily, the brine preserves him perfectly, and when he emerges in present-day Brooklyn, he finds that he hasn't aged a day. When Herschel connects with his only surviving relative, his great-grandson Ben (also played by Rogen), an easygoing app developer, the pair's attempts to bridge their 100-year gap lead them to reconsider the true meaning of family - and the value of a really good pickle. Herschel Greenbaum (Seth Rogen) is digging a ditch in the small Eastern European town of Schlupsk in 1919. His shovel breaks, not once but twice; first the handle breaks off and when he puts his back into it, using only the blade, it splits lengthwise. He neither glorifies nor bemoans his fate, traveling in a horse-drawn cart.At the market, he is captivated by Sarah (Sarah Snook) at the fish peddler's table, who tells him she is too poor to buy at those prices. Herschel wastes no time doubling his work load and presents the peddler with a coin for his best fish, which he hands to Sarah, who immediately begins to eat it, appreciating Herschel. And so they begin to meet regularly and fall in love.Their wedding ended with a Cossak invasion that destroyed the town. Hand in hand, the couple set sail for America, where they hoped to make their fortune, so that Sarah could afford her very own grave and Hershel would buy seltzer water and feel the bubbles on his tongue. After processing on Ellis Island, Herschel is happy that there are no Cossacks and thinks being called a ""Dirty Jew"" is a blessing.They make their home in Brooklyn, in a modest apartment with plaster peeling from the ceiling. Herschel, meanwhile, works in a pickle factory, where the boss would only give him a job bludgeoning rats to death with a club. Optimistic to achieve the American Dream, they expect a baby. Herschel also buys a family plot so that they'll be buried side by side but he still can't afford to buy seltzer water.One day, as the colony of rats is walking towards Herschel, he backs away from them. The wooden rail on the platform gives way and he falls into a vat of pickles. The boss puts a lid on the pickle vat and announces to all that the factory has been condemned. All workers file out, leaving Herschel in brine.One hundred years later, two young boys follow their drone into the condemned building and remove the lid from the pickle vat. In moments, as they look into the dark water with pickles floating on the surface, Herschel suddenly sits up, giving out a scream. The spooked boys run away.Scientists hold a national press conference with Herschel sitting with them, dressed in white scrubs. Their explanation is that the pickle brine preserved him perfectly and even though one hundred years have passed, he hasn't aged a day, using graphs and charts to convince a skeptical group of journalists.Herschel is impressed with the scientific presentation but he's sad because all he that he ever had or knew, is gone. A newspaper clipping is found with Sarah's obituary and Herschel insists the scientists check again, though she'd been dead for eighty years. After he punches the scientist in the nose, he's held back by three men. With Herschel restrained to an examination table, the scientist tells him that they found a living relative, his great-grandson, who lives in Brooklyn and is the same age as Herschel. They contact Ben Greenbaum (Seth Rogen), who comes to take Herschel home. In Ben's apartment, Herschel is amused at the soda maker in Ben's kitchen and Ben offers him milk - cow's, almond, pea, etc.Herschel is very emotional, certain that his progeny is strong and successful but Ben, who's a freelance app developer, working to launch ""Boop Bop,"" a service that checks companies' ethics when buying their products, doesn't really know what to make of it. He's not eager to find family. For him, family and religion mean very little and have no value. For Herschel, they mean everything.They locate Sarah's grave, which is in a neglected plot of land, strewn with garbage and a billboard, on the outskirt of the cemetery, Herschel is angry that there is a billboard there and no regard at all is given to the headstones of his relatives, buried there. After one hundred years, his wife, son and grandson and their wives, are buried there. He confronts workers who've come to post a new ad on the billboard, failing to understand modern protocol and calls them Cossacks. Solving things with the hands of a man who had dug ditches from morning til evening, like bear paws, In a rage, with clenched fists, he delivers a punch right to the worker's face, knocking him over. When Ben tries to control Herschel, great-granddad delivers a backhand punch right into Ben's nose. Herschel was out of control and both landed in jail.Once they were released, Herschel is even more determined to make $200,000, in order to buy the cemetery plot, get rid of the billboard and preserve the memory of his beloved Sarah and their children. Ben loses his investor and can no longer launch his app, BoopBop, because of his prison record. He holds nothing back and tells Herschel he is obsolete and not wanted. Herschel, vowing to show Ben how stupid he is, takes to the streets. When he learns that the price of a cucumber is ninety cents a piece, he thinks of what to do. He rummages around trash cans and finds items with which he builds a cart. He then continues and finds discarded cucumbers, a bag of salt and odd glass jars with lids. With no knowledge or regard for hygiene, he arranges the jars on picnic tables in the park, places cucumbers in the jars, pours salt and lets them fill with rain water. He closes the jars and lets them pickle.Once they're ready, Herschel proceeds to peddle his hand made pickles and they become all the rage. His antiquated folkways and mentality, along with his accent, seem refreshing to a couple of young, Generation Z customers, who turn him into an Internet sensation, with everyone flocking to buy his pickles. Riding in a taxi, Ben watches as Herschel calls him stupid, while Herschel, in an interview, tells the public that everything is from refuse and that the rain water he gets runs off the gutters, with the runoff that includes bird droppings and other animal parts providing essential nutrients.Ben leaves the taxi and phones in an anonymous report after which the Health Department shuts down Herschel's operation, until he brings things up to code and pays taxes. Herschel's two biggest fans encourage him to work legally and get interns. He gets a lot of young people to work for him in the park, where he lives in a crude shelter he constructed from boards and other odd ends, in exchange for teaching them how to select and pickle the cucumbers, adhering to code and wearing gloves. One intern, Clara (Molly Evenson) becomes his assistant. Ben is incensed when he sees the young interns selling jars of pickles outside his favorite restaurant.When Herschel boasts to Ben that the billboard is down, Ben convinces him that he must get a Twitter account and tweet everything he feels and wants to say about everything. Ben knows this will be a public relations disaster, with Herschel's complete lack of tact. Herschel dictates to Clara everything he wants to tweet and doesn't care when she is hesitant to post his politically incorrect views. The following morning, Herschel wakes to a group of protesters in the park, who he thinks are customers. This time, Clara joins them and carries a sign.Herschel is now protested and boycotted and the media sees his behavior as strategic. This gets him a political following. Herschel participates in a debate against a university professor, Dr. Kim Ecklund (Joanna Adler). Ben disguises his voice and appearance in the back row and asks Herschel about his thoughts on Christian prayer in public schools. The elder's answer sparks an outrage and the media digs a bit and when his immigration records from a century ago can't be found, his citizenship is revoked and an Order of Deportation against Herschel is issued.Herschel being Herschel, breaks through Ben's window and asks Ben for one last favor, to take him to Canada, where he can start life anew and Ben will be rid of him. On the trip, they bond to some degree. They reach the woods at the snowy border and spot Canadian police taking a break and lay low but when Ben reveals that he brought Herschel down by baiting and turning him into authorities, great-grandpa punches him in the nose and shouts, calling the attention of the police.Herschel grabs Ben's backpack and hides under a fallen tree, where he finds a shaver and removes his facial hair, changes part of his clothing and presents Ben's ID. Here he tells them that he's Ben and points and tells them his great-grandson is Herschel. Herschel is then deported to Schlupsk, where he is very cold and nobody speaks English. One man, who understood him, indicated that the only place he'd find refuge is in the synagogue. Provided with warmth and a mattress and crude bedding on the floor, the old men call him to stand with them in prayer to form a quorum. He is moved by the unfamiliar ritual and gains an awareness and appreciation for the world from which his forebears came.Meanwhile, back in the Brooklyn apartment, Ben looks at an old photo album and finds Ben's childhood stick figure drawing of his family on a piece of paper, calling his father Boop and his mother Bop and then himself. Herschel realizes that family was important to Ben, after all, since he named his app for his parents.Herschel travels to Schlupsk and finds Ben in the synagogue. Herschel takes him to the bench where he and Sarah used to sit and they talk about working together when they go back to New York, pickling all kinds of things and marketing on the Internet to sell them all over the world."
The Silencing,2020,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7149730/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A reformed hunter living in isolation on a wildlife sanctuary becomes involved in a deadly game of cat and mouse when he and the local Sheriff set out to track a vicious killer who may have kidnapped his daughter years ago. A reformed hunter now living secluded in a wildlife sanctuary after the disappearance of his teen daughter years ago saves a young girl from being killed by a serial killer but gets caught in a deadly cat-and-mouse game. His path crosses with the town's sheriff who also seeks to bring the serial killer to justice after the discovery of the body of a teenaged girl.—Fella_shibby@yahoo.com The movie opens with an dead person in brightly colored clothing floating down white-water rapids.Elsewhere, we see a pair of hunters about to shoot a deer. Rayburn Swanson (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) stops them, and confiscates their weapons, and indicates that they're trespassing in a sanctuary. The hunters seem to know him, and their conversation indicates that Rayburn used to be a hunter himself. ""People change,"" he says to them. ""No they don't,"" one of them replies.Rayburn goes home to his dog, Thor. He owns surveillance equipment monitoring the sanctuary.We meet Sheriff Alice Gustafson (Annabelle Wallis). She picks her brother, Brooks (Hero Fiennes Tiffin) from Karl Blackhawk (Zahn McClarnon), Sheriff of the local tribal police, who found him at the Factory, implied to be a seedy location. Brooks looks to have been in an altercation, but refuses to tell Blackhawk what happened at the Factory.As Alice drives Brooks home, he confesses that he was involved in a fight with Sam Moonblood over ""a woman"". He says Sam and someone named Olson are involved in all sorts of bad things. Brooks expresses discomfort as they drive past a barn. Alice is called into a possible homicide investigation.Rayburn entertains a school field trip while slightly intoxicated. He explains that he manages a 50 square mile sanctuary. One of the kids mention how Rayburn used to be a prolific hunter. He says he has left that life behind because his daughter didn't like him doing it.Alice and the local cops investigate a young girl's body that's washed ashore. A forensic officer says the body was probably dumped in the water post-mortem, about a week prior. The body has a vertical scar on the throat area. The cops find an spearhead embedded in a nearby tree and think the girl may have been hunted for sport.We see Rayburn driving around town, putting up missing person posters for his 14-year old daughter, Gwen. Soon after, he runs into Blackhawk and his wife, Debbie (Melanie Scrofano). Their conversation reveals that Debbie is Rayburn's ex-wife. She invites Rayburn to a funeral that Blackhawk is organizing for Gwen. She wants Rayburn to sign a document formally presuming Gwen's death to get a death certificate issued.We see Alice examining the spearhead from earlier in her office. Shining a flashlight through it reveals an emblem ""MB"".Back home, a drunk Rayburn sees the news of the unidentified girl's body being found and drives over.Alice visits her brother, Brooks. They talk about their parents' death. Brooks asks his sister if she'd have his back if he was ever involved in something terrible. A moment later, Rayburn shows up looking for Alice and requests that she show him the Jane Doe body. They visit the morgue, where he confirms it's not Gwen.Later in the evening, Alice finds Rayburn at a bar. She wants to help find Gwen to prove herself to the town. Rayburn is not optimistic. He considers it a cold case, as Gwen went missing five years prior.The next morning, Rayburn sees a person in a heavily camouflaged ghillie suit take down one of his cameras in the sanctuary. He puts together his own hunting kit and drives over there. He gets spears shot at, taking one the shoulder, but escaping. His vehicle is stalled, so he is unable to drive away. Walking around, he finds another pickup truck, presumably belonging to the hunter. He discreetly keys a small ""x"" next to its fuel tank, before returning home on foot.Rewinding surveillance footage, he learns that the hunter has been tracking a human girl. He returns to the forest, makes contact with the hunter, but is ultimately unable to capture them.Alice shows the found spearhead to a local seller hunting gear. He explains to her that the spear was likely shot using an atlatl, a rare, and now illegal handheld spear-slinging weapon of ancient design. He refers her to Sam Moonblood, who hangs out at the Factory, and sells atlatls of his own construction.In the forest, Rayburn finds the hunted girl, passed out.Alice visits the Factory, seemingly a hangout spot for delinquents and unhoused people. She inquires about Sam Moonblood and is told that he's likely out hunting. A girl named Patty tells Alice a possible location she may find Moonblood.In the forest, Rayburn is carrying the unconscious girl. He comes across a small underground bunker. The girl comes to. She seems unable to speak, and indicates in writing that her name is Molly. They take shelter for the night.Alice shows up at Moonblood's suspected residence, which is unoccupied. There, she finds atlatls spearheads with the same ""MB"" initials. She runs into Blackhawk who followed her there. He shows her a picture of Molly, who is missing. He tells her that her mother hangs out at the Factory. According to him, she said she got into an altercation with Brooks. Alice refuses to believe that her brother could have anything to do with a kidnapping, while Blackhawk seems to consider it a possibility.The next morning, Alice visits Brooks's residence. He's not there, but she finds newspaper clippings about kidnappings.Rayburn and Molly continue on foot. As they take a break, he shows Molly a picture of Gwen, whom she doesn't recognize. They eventually reach Rayburn's residence, where Thor is heard whimpering. Rayburn is ambushed by the hunter, still obscured by the ghillie suit. Molly tries to fight the hunter, but gets stabbed by a spear.Just then, Alice arrives, meaning to ask Rayburn about the guns he confiscated from those hunters earlier. She holds the hunter at gunpoint, who surrenders. However, Alice recognizes him to be Brooks because of his knuckle cracking habit. She turns around and shoots Rayburn instead, letting her brother escape. Rayburn also escapes this situation. He calls an ambulance for Molly, traps Alice in a bear trap, and drives her SUV to Blackhawk and Debbie's residence. He tells them how Alice shot him to protect her brother.Alice calls for backup and calls for Rayburn's arrest.Blackhawk and Debbie take Rayburn to the Factory, and have their confidant Dr. Boone (Shaun Smyth) to treat him. Brooks happens to arrive at the Factory just then, looking for drugs. After a foot chase, Blackhawk arrests him. Alice is notified of this, who comes over. Blackhawk stands his ground, believing Rayburn's story, reminds her that she does not have jurisdiction over his county, and refuses to let her see Brooks.Shortly after, Brooks leads the cops (including Alice and Blackhawk) to the barn from earlier. There, they find Sam Moonblood (Gregory Odjig), bound and gagged. Blackhawk explains that Brooks has been keeping Moonblood here since their altercation, but also denies any knowledge of Molly. Blackhawk believes Brooks, as eyewitnesses place him at the Factory when Alice and Rayburn had their encounter, meaning the hunter's identity is still unknown. Blackhawk recommends Alice be placed on leave and investigated for shooting Rayburn. Alice calls off the search for Rayburn. At the Factory, Rayburn is told that the hunter wasn't Brooks.The following day, Blackhawk calls Alice over to question Moonblood. He mentions that Rayburn changed his story, saying ""the suspect must have shot him."" Moonblood says he doesn't track names of his customers whom he sells atlatls. He doesn't recognize the found spearhead, saying it's made from a different wood than what he uses.As Rayburn is cleaning out bottles of alcohol, presumably with the intention of quitting, we see a flashback to when his daughter disappeared from his car as he stopped to buy whiskey. To this day, he holds on to that old bottle of whiskey.Alice visits a gravely injured Molly in the hospital. She notices the same kind of scar on her throat as the Jane Doe body from earlier.Later, Rayburn comes across a pickup truck identical to the one he found in the forest (presumably belonging to the mystery hunter). He chases it down and looks for his ""x"" mark, but doesn't find one. Intent on tracking the hunter down, he hangs around some busy roads until he sees another one of these trucks. He follows this one until it stops at a house. He finds his mark next to the fuel tank, but learns that it's driven by an old man who lives by himself, unlikely to be the hunter. The man tells Rayburn that his neighbor sometimes uses the truck.Rayburn decides to pay this neighbor's house a visit. Breaking in, he finds a dark room with posters and newspaper clippings of people who have gone missing in the area. He also finds a room with an unconscious girl with her throat surgically cut open. Just then, he gets ambushed by Dr. Boone, who injects Rayburn with something to knock him out.Back at the hospital, Alice is taken to Dr. Boone's office to look for an autopsy report. There, she finds out Boone had a daughter named Melissa who was hit by a drunk driver in a forest and left to die. In a framed picture of them, Melissa appears to be wearing a pendant with exactly the same ""MB"" initials from the spearheads.With police backup, Alice breaks into Boone's residence and finds the unconscious girl. Neither Boone nor Rayburn are there. She notices Gwen Swanson's missing poster and wants to find Rayburn.Boone drives Rayburn, who is drifting back into consciousness into the forest. Boone gives Rayburn a head start as he puts on his hunting suit. Alice gets to Rayburn's place, finds Thor barking at the surveillance system, and sees Rayburn running on foot through the sanctuary in darkness while being tracked by the hunter. Armed, she runs into the sanctuary on foot to find them.Rayburn eventually sneaks up on Boone and overpowers him. He asks Boone ""why Gwen?"" Boone reveals that Rayburn's drunk driving killed his daughter, Melissa, and that he figured Gwen being his daughter, would also grow up to be a ""drain on everyone."" He says he only ""took the ones that no one would miss.""Rayburn knocks Boone out and starts dragging him somewhere to kill him. At that moment, Alice comes upon them and holds Rayburn at gunpoint. He asks her to shoot him again or walk away. He drops Boone onto an old, defunct animal trap of his own, all but killing him. A fatally injured Boone asks if Rayburn will leave him to die like an animal, to which Rayburn replies that he wouldn't leave an animal suffering, as he covers up the trap, deserting Boone.Back in town, a funeral is held for Gwen that many, including Molly, attend.We see the barn where Brooks held Moonblood being demolished. We learn from Alice's police radio that Dr. Boone is suspected to be a serial killer and still considered missing.The movie closes on Rayburn presumably about to pour out the bottle of whiskey that he purchased the day Gwen was kidnapped."

Made in Italy,2020,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9207700/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A bohemian artist travels from London to Italy with his estranged son to sell the house they inherited from their late wife/mother. Jack is getting divorced and his London art gallery building belongs to his parents-in-law so his soon-to-be ex-wife gives him one month to find the money to buy the place. He contacts his estranged artist/painter dad, Robert, and they drive down to Tuscany, Italy, to fix up and sell the country house inherited from their late wife/mom (car accident). Jack hasn't been there since he was 7 and it hasn't been used the following 20 years or so. It has a fantastic view but is in dire need of repair and paint if they want to sell it. Jack heads to the nearest town and meets cute, single divorcee Natalia, who owns and runs a restaurant there.—Scott Filtenborg The movie opens in Flite Gallery, an art gallery in London, managed by Jack (Micheál Richardson, Liam Neeson's real life son) but owned by Ruth (Yolanda Kettle) Jack's estranged wife and her family. Ruth tells Jack that her family is selling the gallery and seeing as how he put great effort but never any money in it, he has no say or input in this decision. Jack says that he and his father can sell the Italian house and that with that, he'll buy the gallery.Jack goes to his father, Robert (Liam Neeson), a true bohemian artist, whose London flat is also his studio, first thing in the morning, to tell him that they have to sell the house in Italy. Robert comes out of his bedroom wrapped in a robe, with a scruffy beard and mustache and as he is talking to Jack, a woman comes out of the bedroom, fully clothed. Robert introduces the woman to Jack but calls her by a different name. She curses him and storms out.Jack, not yet having told his father that he and his wife, Ruth, are divorcing, insists they go to the Italian house and just sell it. Robert tells him that the house isn't what he might imagine it to be, not having been visited for many years. Robert tells Jack that he couldn't understand Jack's sudden interest, who hadn't been to that house since he was seven years old.Jack has no feeling for the house in Tuscany, Italy and can't understand why his father doesn't want to sell it. When they arrive, the old, neglected, piece of real estate is so run down, more than either of them expected, that the warped wooden front door won't even open. When Jack puts his shoulder into banging the unlocked door, it falls into the house, kicking up a lot of dust.Jack contacted Kate (Lindsay Duncan), a real estate broker who is British and maintains her composure, even in the face of the eyesore of a house. There is an entire wall painted in black, brown yellow, blue and red, Robert's homage to the style of artist Frank Swine.With holes in the roof and ceiling and other, sorely needed repairs, all they can eat in that place is slices of bread and some tomato, with coffee out of a thermos and disposable cup. There is also a weasel that took up residence and doesn't appreciate being locked in the cabinet in which he was discovered or, for that matter, having any other human interference in his life.With Kate's help, a local expert comes and captures the weasel, removing it from the premises. After that, local repairmen renovate, close up all holes and put fresh paint on the walls and archways.Robert tries to delicately steer Jack away from selling the house and Jack storms off and drives to the town, where he clumsily knocks over a podium while reading a menu and a couple of outdoor tables of an empty restaurant. Leaning over him, as he's sprawled on the cobblestones, is Natalia (Valeria Bilello), owner and operator of the restaurant. Though the place is closed on that day, she serves Jack a plate of Risotto and they talk about the house and the fact that he wants to sell it.As things go on, people come to see the house and father and son finally go out to eat, at Natalia's restaurant, which is full to capacity this time with her family celebrating her brother-in-law's birthday. A man, Marzio (Gian Marco Tavani) arrives, accompanied by a woman and Natalia refuses to accommodate them and her family gather behind her to make sure he and his date leave.Jack, meanwhile, has got the motorbike running and rides it regularly. He takes in the view and country and spends time with Natalia, learning more about her. Jack opens up to her in ways he can't to his father. He also learns that she is divorced with a young daughter, in her ex-husband's custody.Robert is ever more eager to keep the house. When people come to buy the house, he sends them away, refusing the sale.In the more habitable house, Jack discovers a bedroom that contains all of his childhood and his father's drawings of him and his late mother. Jack confronts his father for having kept those things and memories from him all the years. His father tells him of the car accident that took her life and of how he was the one who should have been in the car, except he was so engrossed in painting that he lost track of the time and she lost her life when it should have been him. With Robert shaking and crying bitter tears, Jack comes up from behind him and embraces him. Robert turns to face Jack and hugs him. Father and son finally bond at this moment. Jack finally tells Robert that Ruth left him and they're getting a divorce.Robert meets Jack in London, outside Jack's flat, after Jack won't take his calls and later, seated at a restaurant, he hands Jack a check, with his hand shaking, telling him that he sold his London house, which will buy Jack out of his share of the house in Italy and enable him to buy back his gallery. They open up to one another and Robert tells Jack that the reason he never came to the gallery was because Ruth told him it would put too much pressure on Jack. Robert tells Jack that he's going to live in Italy and that, at Kate's suggestion, is going to host ""painting holidays.""We next see Jack walking into Flite Gallery, which is empty except for Ruth and a contractor. Ruth comes up to him to tell him that they're not selling and Jack insists on giving her something she would want. Jack hands Ruth signed divorce papers.Jack returns to Italy, to a well kept, furnished house, during an art class his father is giving. Jack tells Robert that it was never about the money but he wants a father. They embrace, as Kate looks on.Jack meets Natalia, where she explains that any contact with her ex-husband is just to keep the peace for the sake of her daughter.Jack tells his father that he's going to open a gallery exhibiting his father's works.

Zola,2020,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5439812/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A stripper named Zola embarks on a wild road trip to Florida. Zola narrates her story to a fellow stripper. In 2015, she made 148 tweets, which cover the bulk of her story.Aziah ""Zola"" King (Taylour Paige), a self-assured waitress and part-time stripper in Detroit, meets Stefani (Riley Keough), an outgoing and crass fellow stripper, while serving her at work. Stefani invites Zola to dance with her at a club that night, and the two form a quick friendship. The next day, Stefani proposes that Zola join her on a road trip to Tampa, Florida, the location of a strip club where Stefani claims the two can make significant money. Zola joins Stefani, her mysterious roommate, Abegunde ""X"" Olawale (Colman Domingo), and Stefani's sheepish boyfriend, Derrek (Nicholas Braun), on a road trip. Sean (Ari'el Stachel) is Zola's boyfriend and she never tells him about the road-trip with Stefani.Upon arriving in Tampa, Stefani, Zola, and X leave Derrek at a seedy motel while they visit the club where Stefani claims her friends earned over $5,000 in one night. The two perform at the club, but do not net nearly as much as Stefani insisted they would. After, Zola learns that Stefani and X have posted photos (which Stefani took of Zola, while saying that she is simply taking some selfies) of her and Stefani in a Backpage (online site where you buy and sell sex) advertisement selling a night of sex with them. Zola attempts to leave, but is threatened by X, who reveals himself to be Stefani's pimp. X says he knows where Zola lives and unless she cooperates, she will be in danger.X brings the women to an upscale hotel, where Stefani proceeds to have sex with a male client. Zola again wanted to leave, but Stefani says she is also scared and is only doing this for her kid and doesn't want to be alone.
Zola, who does not wish to participate, is incredulous when she learns that X is charging only $150 per client (That is equivalent to about 20 mins on the pole, dancing). Zola edits the Backpage advertisement, changing the rate to $500 to help Stefani earn more money; by the end of the night, Stefani has made over $8,000.
The next morning, X is initially insulted by Zola's intervention, but quickly grows impressed. He throws some cash at Zola, as her share, but refuses to give any cut to Stefani, saying that he supports all her expenses and that's not cheap. Meanwhile, Derrek, left to his own devices, befriends a man named Dion (Jason Mitchell) whom he meets at the motel. When X, Stefani, and Zola return to the motel, X is enraged to discover that Derrek informed Dion about their reason for visiting Tampa. Worried that Dion and his associates will rob them, X forces the group to flee.After arriving at another hotel, X arranges for Stefani to see more clients at various locations, while a reluctant Zola stands by to ensure Stefani's safety. X gives Zola a cut from the earnings but warns her again of consequences if she tries to walk away.
When Derrek realizes Stefani is again engaging in prostitution, he argues with her, revealing to Zola that Stefani has manipulated other dancers into unwittingly participating in similar prostitution rackets. Zola is angered and loses all trust in Stefani. Derrek and Stefani's quarreling is interrupted when X bursts in with Baybe (Sophie Hall), his lover and madam, who is armed with a gun. After calming the situation, X gives Zola a gun for the women's protection, and Stefani and Zola are sent out so Stefani can continue to meet with clients.After Stefani engages in a gang bang at a private residence, the two women visit another hotel, where a client has responded to their Backpage ad. Upon opening the hotel room door, Stefani is grabbed by the client and forced into the room. A terrified Zola flees and calls X and Derrek on her phone. The three return to the room and find the men inside are Dion and an accomplice, armed with shotguns, who have posed as clients in order to rob Stefani of her earnings. Dion wants $20K & ownership of Stefani, as it turns out Dion is a pimp himself and is angry that X walked in on his turf.
At gunpoint, X offers possession of Zola & $50K, if they let him and Derrek leave with Stefani, who has been beaten unconscious. As Zola is digitally penetrated against her will by Dion, X manages to draw the gun Zola has in her purse, then shoots Dion in the throat. The group flee the hotel, disposing of Dion's guns by throwing them into the Tampa Bay.The group eventually arrives at a large, luxurious home X shares with Baybe. X finally allows Zola to leave and proclaims his possession of Stefani, but Derrek threatens to commit suicide should Stefani remain loyal to X. Derrek immediately throws himself over a balcony, landing on concrete below and injuring his head. Zola, Stefani, and X leave to take Derrek to the hospital. In the car, Stefani proclaims her love for Zola, but is met with cool disgust as an exhausted Zola looks out the window and ignores her."

Derrick approaches Carter while he is jogging and attempts to warn him, but a struggle ensues and Carter is accidentally shot dead.Derrick goes to Valerie's apartment and she admits to killing Tracie, Rafe, Tyrin and Tyrin's friend. She says she will kill anyone who prevents her getting her daughter back. He realizes this includes him and they shoot each other.

She chances upon a university sleep study that offers the promise of safety and money, and which also brings her an unexpected friend and confidant in the overseeing scientist Jeremy.

Essentially homeless, she steals food from her mother's house and sleeps in a hammock outdoors or at friends' homes. She is also plagued by strange, surreal nightmares of a dark maze and a shadowy figure with glowing eyes.In need of money, Sara agrees to be a test subject in a sleep experiment, the goal of which is classified. At first, Sara sleeps well but, after two sessions, her nightmares worsen and she has a panic attack when one of the scientists shows her a picture of the same shadowy figure from her dreams. She is also troubled by the only other woman in the study dropping out and the fact none of the scientists will divulge the purpose of the study.One day, after passing out in a laundromat and being robbed, Sara confronts one of the scientists, a young man named Riff, insisting that the study has had a negative impact on her and she will only continue as a test subject if he divulges the study's purpose. He informs her the experiment involves monitoring subjects' dreams using a brain scanning device that converts brainwaves into images.During the next session, Sara and the rest of the experiment volunteers are shown to all dream of the same shadowy figure at the same time. Riff states that, across the world and throughout history, people have all dreamed of a similar figure, which has also haunted him since childhood.

Traumatized and exhausted, they end up having sex, during which Sara sees two shadowy figures and passes out again, motivating Riff to take her to a hospital.As Riff waits for a report of Sara's status, he begins to have visions of a dark maze and humanoid figure made of hands. He then learns Sara has left her room and realizes that she is a somnambulist as she wanders out of the hospital. He calls his colleague, Anita, and asks her to join him in monitoring Sara's dream as she sleepwalks through the city.Anita arrives and they attach a mobile monitor to Sara's head as she unconsciously leads them to a remote, wooded area.

When he answers the phone call, Sara wakes, screaming and bleeding from her eyes.Riff apologizes to Sara and she identifies the phone as hers despite the fact she has never been there before.

The trio flee, but both Riff and Anita are swallowed by darkness as Sara is approached by a shadowy figure.Suddenly, Sara wakes up again in Riff's apartment, naked and straddling Riff's dead body, having apparently gouged out his eyes in a somnambulist episode. She goes to the bathroom, where she receives a text message that makes her laugh and examines her reflection, discovering she has fangs.The message says she has been in a coma for twenty years, as she is being studied using a new technique, and the scientists are not sure where in her dream the message will reach her. It begs her to wake up before the screen cuts to black. (copied from Wikipedia)"

The Last Thing He Wanted,2020,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7456312/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A veteran D.C. journalist loses the thread of her own narrative when a guilt-propelled errand for her father thrusts her from byline to unwitting subject in the very story she's trying to break. Adapted from Joan Didion's namesake novel. Elena McMahon (Anne Hathaway) is a journalist reporting out of the Atlantic Post's Central American bureau in El Salvador who is forced to flee during the civil war. During her coverage, she wonders how so many arms and guns found their way into El Salvador. Who was profiting from the war and why?
A few years later she's pushing to reopen the bureau, but her editor reveals that Congress is secretly pressuring the paper to dial back their coverage of Central and South American affairs (Elena had been asking questions about the CIA laying mines around Nicaraguan ports to block their trade. The Contras are the rebel group in Nicaragua and there is speculation that the Reagan administration is supporting them, even though the Congress has prohibited funding them explicitly), so reopening the bureau isn't an option. Elena is angry as she had tracked the bullet casings from El Salvador to Missourie. She was close to a breakthrough on the story.
Instead, he reassigns Elena to cover Ronald Reagan's re-election campaign in 1984.Elena reluctantly agrees to meet with her absentee father, Dick (Willem Dafoe). She deduces that he's still involved in trafficking illegal contraband, but also realizes that he is suffering from dementia.
She embarks on Reagan's campaign trail. In Cincinnati, she uses her acquaintance with Helena Shultz to get a seat at the table of her husband, Secretary of State George Shultz (she had earlier questioned Shultz on the mines around Nicaraguan ports) during Helena's birthday party. She attempts to question him but he stonewalls her until a staffer intervenes.
Secretary Shultz meets with Ambassador-at-Large Treat Morrison (Ben Affleck), who has been looking into Elena's background since her original encounter with Shultz. Morrison is in favor of letting Elena report on Nicaragua, as her coverage justifies military intervention in the country.In Houston she meets with General Gus Sharp who had previously identified American shell casings in El Salvador as coming from a stockpile in Missouri. She shows him surveillance photos of shipping containers, which Sharp identifies as surplus arms from various National Guard units, including the 20th Special Forces. Arms travel to Florida and from there to all countries close to Nicaragua and from there into Nicaragua itself.
Elena again takes her story to the editor that the US administration is arming the rebels in Nicaragua against the Government. Her editor wont budge on publishing her story.Elena receives a call that Dick has been hospitalized. She hands off her assignment to her friend Alma (Rosie Perez) and goes to Florida to take care of him. Dick begs her to meet his business associate, Sedlow (Mel Rodriguez), for an important deal that he has setup (he says that the deal has been put up on credit, as he is supposed to get paid $ 1 MM in traveler's checks on delivery. Half of it has to go to the loan sharks. So he needs to pay $500K to the sharks, whether he delivers the guns or not). She reluctantly agrees to effectively become an arms dealer, allowing her to investigate the story from the inside. Sedlow gives her specific instructions for how to deliver a large arms shipment to Costa Rica. She is to receive payment in traveler's checks, but upon arriving in Costa Rica the buyer, Jones (Edi Gathegi), shorts her, also paying in cocaine. When the cargo pilot she flew in with leaves without her, Jones drives her to San Jose. She seizes an opportunity to take his gun and vehicle, driving herself the rest of the way. Elena calls Alma from San Jose, and wants to know about MAx Epperson (a named that Dick gave her for when she got in trouble). Alma says she couldn't find anything on Max, but a guy named Bob Weir kept coming up during her South America investigations. They both think Bob Weir is CIA. She checks into a hotel room, where Sedlow calls, having tracker her down. Elena threatens him to get her out, as she knows that the payment was in drugs and not checks, as promised. The morning, she gets her flight ticket under the door.
When leaving Costa Rica she discovers the passport she was given has the name Elise Meyer. She manages to depart, narrowly avoiding trouble when her cab driver is stopped by security with her bag (she had left the bag in the taxi and the cab driver brought it her when she was at immigration counter) containing the cocaine and gun; the bag has her father's male name on it, so the cab driver is arrested.Elena ends up in Antigua, where she learns that her father has passed away. She attempts to enter the American embassy so she can get a proper passport, but it is the 4th of July, and nobody is available. Dejected, she returns to her hotel, where Morrison arrives, who hides his true agenda. Morrison knows that with a fake passport Elena has no way back home. She admits that she came on a ghost plane and she didn't get paid either. She came for her father and stayed for the story.
After some mild verbal sparring, Elena sleeps with Morrison. She confesses to him who her father is and what she has been doing for him in Central America, believing that her focus on this story was motivated by the fact that she's losing her connection to her daughter, Cat (Onata Aprile), who's enrolled in a boarding school, and her work will be all she has. She says she thought Morrison was the man sent by Washington to kill her.The next day, Elena is by the hotel pool when Jones arrives and rescues her from an attack by gunmen. He escorts her to safety and explains to her that the deal her father was offered was fake, meant to lure Dick out of hiding. He argues that Elena coming instead of Dick was a mistake and US is still trying to figure out how to close the file on her. Elena talks to Alma and realizes that Jone is French intelligence (Alma told her that there was a French operative down there) and the attack on the hotel was staged to originally kill Dick, but Elena showed up instead.
Elena walls Morrison, who puts her in touch with Paul Schuster (Toby Jones), who gives her a place to stay while things get sorted out. Elena uses this time to hides all her notes and materials in Paul's house. One night Elena sees a mysterious person meet Paul and she recognizes this man as Dick's business partner Max Epperson, and suspects that Max is also the CIA under cover man Bob Weir. Bob is known as the one who ties lose ends.
After several days at Paul's, Morrison reaches out and lays out a plan to get her home, where she can break the story on the arms deals. The next day, a shooter arrives at Paul's, killing him and his staff before calling out to Elena. She turns around to see Morrison, who fatally shoots her. It is shown that Jones arrives and finds Elena's materials, which he takes with him.Morrison gives official testimony claiming he shot in self-defense. Meanwhile, Jones issues an official report to his superiors in French Intelligence revealing he had been trying to protect Elena. Finally, Alma uses all of the notes and information gathered by Elena to posthumously publish the story of the Iran-Contra Affair.
US sold arms to Iran, to fund the Contras, in contravention to the laws of Congress."

From Academy Award® Winner Spike Lee comes a new joint: the story of four African American Vets--Paul (Delroy Lindo), Otis (Clarke Peters), Eddie (Norm Lewis), and Melvin (Isiah Whitlock, Jr.)--who return to Vietnam. Searching for the remains of their fallen Squad Leader (Chadwick Boseman) and the promise of buried treasure, our heroes, joined by Paul's concerned son (Jonathan Majors), battle the forces of Man and Nature while confronted by the lasting ravages of the immorality of the Vietnam War.—Netflix During the Vietnam War, a squad of Black US Army soldiers of the 1st Infantry Division,[3] Paul, Otis, Eddie, Melvin and their squad leader Norman, who dub themselves the ""Bloods,"" secure the site of a CIA airplane crash and recover its cargo, a locker of gold bars intended as payment for the Lahu people for their help in fighting the Viet Cong. The Bloods decide to take the gold for themselves and bury it so they can retrieve it later. However, in the ensuing Vietnamese counter-attack, Norman is killed and the Bloods cannot locate the buried gold after a napalm strike obliterates the identifying landmarks.In the present day, Paul, Otis, Eddie and Melvin meet up in Ho Chi Minh City. A recent landslide had uncovered the tail of the crashed plane, and with this new information they plan to find the gold and Norman's body. Otis reunites with his old Vietnamese girlfriend Tiên, who reveals that he is the father of her grown child.

Soon thereafter they are joined by Paul's son David, who has a tempestuous relationship with his father.Vinh, a tour guide hired by the Bloods, leads the group out into the countryside, where a confrontation with a local merchant forces Paul to admit that he has post-traumatic stress disorder.

During their first night, Paul confiscates a pistol Otis had been secretly given by Tiên and becomes suspicious of his motives. Eventually, the Bloods find the gold bars scattered across the side of a hill. They also find Norman's remains and pray over them.

Worth,2020,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8009744/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"An attorney in Washington D.C. battles against cynicism, bureaucracy and politics to help the victims of 9/11. Following the horrific 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon, Congress appoints attorney and renowned mediator Kenneth Feinberg (Michael Keaton) to lead the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund. Assigned with allocating financial resources to the victims of the tragedy, Feinberg and his firm's head of operations, Camille Biros (Amy Ryan), face the impossible task of determining the worth of a life to help the families who had suffered incalculable losses. When Feinberg locks horns with Charles Wolf (Stanley Tucci), a community organizer mourning the death of his wife, his initial cynicism turns to compassion as he begins to learn the true human costs of the tragedy.—Netflix The film opens with Kenneth Feinberg detailing the law's recognition of the monetary value of a person's life to his class at Columbia University. Sometime later, the September 11 attacks occur. Feinberg is appointed the Special Master of the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund while his law partner, Camille Biros, is appointed as his administrative deputy. Feinberg develops a rigid formula for each payout based on the victim's income, and is instructed that if he cannot convince at least 80 percent of the 7,000 estimated victims to sign on then they will be eligible to file a lawsuit which they may lose (as well as the pressure from the political administrations to save the airlines from being sued, leading to financial disaster). Feinberg is given until December 22, 2003 to accomplish this.At an introductory meeting with victims in which he attempts to explain the rules governing the fund, Feinberg is perceived as insensitive to the losses suffered by attendees. The hostile group is calmed when Charles Wolf, the husband of a woman killed in the attacks, demands that they listen to what Feinberg has to say. After the meeting, Feinberg is confronted by Frank Donato, the brother of a deceased New York City Fire Department (FDNY) firefighter, Nick. His brother had re-entered the tower to find him after communication, which may not have reached Nick, warned that the building would fail. Frank demands that Feinberg includes this information in the report to remedy this flaw in the communication system for first responders. Feinberg deflects that demand in lawyerly fashion. Feinberg also is disturbed to learn that Wolf was offended by the callous nature of the fund's formula and has started a protest group.Biros leads the staff in holding meetings with victims and is moved by the story of a gay man, Graham Morris, whose partner (whose parents vehemently denied that their son was gay) was killed in the attack. Due to the rules governing the fund, he cannot be compensated as he is a resident of the state of Virginia, which does not recognize civil partnerships. Feinberg also meets with several lawyers representing the loved ones of upper-class victims of the attacks, who want more money, which threatens the success of the group as a whole. As the months drag on, the fund manages to attract only a fraction of the necessary applicants, leading Feinberg to hold a private meeting with Wolf in which the latter accuses Feinberg of serving only the interests of the Bush administration.A lawyer representing Donato's extra-marital partner calls Feinberg to inform him that Donato has two daughters from that relationship who qualify for compensation. This leads Feinberg to try to inform Donato's widow to convince her to sign on after she had earlier refused. As the months drag on, Feinberg is increasingly unsuccessful in convincing victims to file for compensation from the government fund. After Wolf approaches him one evening at the opera and recounts an anecdote from years earlier in which his deceased wife encouraged him to persevere in the face of failure, Feinberg finds his spirit renewed.Feinberg and Biros begin to use the discretion government gave him to expand the rules to cover as many victims as they can under the fund. Feinberg begins to meet victims. He constructs a shrine in his office from the various mementos given to him by fund applicants. When Wolf sees that Feinberg truly cares for the victims of the attacks, he is able to convince his fellow victims to trust Feinberg. By the deadline, the vast majority of those eligible for compensation sign the forms, ensuring the success of the project. Feinberg is visited by Donato's widow to sign on behalf of her husband's children. Biros tearfully calls Morris to inform him that while she was unable to help him as the gay partner of a victim, because his state did not recognize their relationship, the fund did compensate many other gay couples who lived in states that recognized same-sex unions. The film ends with a title card stating that Feinberg and Biros were able to distribute billions in government money to 97 percent of eligible victims and that they continue to work on similar cases."

Picking up shortly after the previous film, Rose leads the human spaceship fleet against the alien spaceship fleet. The aliens, called 'Harvesters', are on board the mother ship, called Armada, in orbit of the Moon. However, after breaking through the enemy lines, Rose freezes before she can fire and one of her ships is destroyed. With the Armada preparing to fire on Earth, Rose is forced to destroy one of her own ships when it gets into the crossfire, sacrificing thousands of her own men, but she succeeds in destroying the Armada. Wracked with guilt, Rose vanishes following the battle while humanity rebuilds over the next five years, living alongside billions of freed alien-human hybrids called 'Pilots'.Five years after the battle, Rose lives in a tent city near the ruins of London, avoiding resistance forces led by Leon searching for her and keeping the aging effects of her hybrid nature at bay with the help of hyper-oxygenated blood transfusions prepared for Rose by her friend Dr. Mal. A viral pandemic strikes the Pilots and anyone using transplanted Pilot limbs such as Huana who lost both of his arms and a leg while fighting against the aliens fifteen years before. The virus eats the Pilots alive while reverting them back into their brainwashed state. Leon captures Rose and brings her before General Radford who reveals that the Armada's core drive warped to the Harvester home world, named Cobalt One, moments before Rose destroyed the ship. Only with the Armada's core drive do they have a chance of saving the Pilots. After being reunited with her Pilot adoptive brother Trent, Rose reluctantly agrees to join the mission.At Cobalt One, the team's ship crashes after a collision with an empty Harvester vessel that leaves the ship running on emergency power. The crew of Rose, Trent, Leon, Owens and Alexi find the planet filled with the bodies of dead Harvesters and strange shadow creatures that appear to be mutations of the Harvesters. Alexi is heavily wounded and sacrifices herself with a pulse grenade to kill the creatures, but the team manages to reach the Armada where Rose is briefly possessed by the Matriarch, the Harvester leader who accuses the humans of coming to destroy her species. Trent helps Rose to break free of the Matriarch's control and Rose realizes that the Matriarch's telepathic influence was what caused her to freeze and her problems with her powers since. Now no longer afraid of who she is, Rose embraces her powers and steals the core drive. However, Owens betrays the others, infects Trent with the virus and flees with the core drive.Stealing an alien tanker in order to escape, Rose and Leon discover that Radford had bombed Cobalt One prior to their arrival with a biological weapon, the same virus that is infecting the Pilots on Earth. As Rose and Leon make their way back aboard the ship, Radford uses the core drive to destroy Cobalt One and the Harvesters in an act of genocide. Confronted by Rose and Leon, Radford reveals that the virus was intended to peacefully euthanize the Pilots and to destroy the Harvesters, but it had the unintended side effect of reverting the Pilots back into their brainwashed state. Having boarded the ship as well, the Matriarch attacks, killing Radford and intending to destroy the Earth in revenge. Owens who is being checked on by Zhi, attempts to attack Zhi after he realizes the truth about the virus, but Zhi manages to fight off Owens who attacks Leon and Rose. As the ship enters a wormhole, Owens falls into an energy field and is disintegrated while Trent, whom Leon manages to snap back to normal, knocks the Matriarch in as well, but has most of his body disintegrated in the process.On Earth, Mal works on a cure in the tent city, but the infected Pilots attack before she can finish testing it. The residents, including Mal, Kate, Grant and a cured Huana, fight back and manage to eliminate the attacking Pilots at the cost of Grant and several others, only to have an army of thousands more approach from London. Arriving back in the nick of time, Rose sucks all of the Pilots into her ship and informs Mal that with Mal's cure and Rose's ship, they now have the power to cure all of the infected Pilots worldwide.In the aftermath, Mal transplants Trent's brain into a new Pilot body, saving him. Zhi hacks into Radford's personal files and discovers the location of a prison where Radford had held anyone that he considered to be an enemy of the state, including Rose and Trent's long-missing father Mark Corley.

One Night in Miami...,2020,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10612922/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A fictional account of one incredible night where iconsMuhammad Ali,Malcolm X,Sam Cooke, andJim Browngathered discussing their roles in the Civil Rights Movement and cultural upheaval of the 60s. Set on the night of February 25, 1964, ""One Night in Miami"" follows a young, brash Cassius Clay as he emerges from the Miami Beach Convention Center the new Heavyweight Boxing Champion of the World. Against all odds, he defeated Sonny Liston and shocked the sports world. While crowds of people swarm Miami Beach to celebrate the match, Clay - unable to stay on the island because of Jim Crow-era segregation laws - spends the evening at the Hampton House Motel in Miami's African American Overtown neighborhood celebrating with three of his closest friends: Malcolm X, Sam Cooke, and Jim Brown. During this historic evening, these icons, who each were the very representation of the Pre-Black Power Movement and felt the social pressure their cross-over celebrity brought, shared their thoughts with each other about their responsibilities as influencers, standing up, defending their rights and moving the country forward to equality and empowerment for all black people. The next morning, the four men emerge determined to define a new world for themselves and their community. The film opens with a title card telling us that this film was inspired by true events.It's 1963 and the film shows us four different things going on at about the same time. First, Cassius Clay (Eli Goree) nearly loses a boxing match to Henry Cooper at Wembley Stadium in London because he spends so much time taunting Cooper that he opens himself up to a direct punch. Meanwhile, at the Copacabana in New York City, soul singer Sam Cooke (Leslie Odom Jr.) makes his debut at that club in front of an indifferent, all-white audience. Then we see NFL player Jim Brown (Aldis Hodge) making his return home to Georgia, where he is received by family friend Mr. Carlton (Beau Bridges) on a huge plantation. Carlton heaps all kinds of praise on ""the great Jim Brown,"" but when Brown offers to help Carlton move some furniture, Carlton uses a racial slur and informs Brown that he is not welcome inside the home due to Brown's race. And finally, we see Malcolm X (Kingsley Ben-Adir) return home and discuss his plans to leave the Nation of Islam with his wife, Betty.We move forward in time. A graphic tells us that it's February 25, 1964. The men are all gathering in Miami for Clay's title bout against Sonny Liston. Malcolm meets with Clay in a motel room before the fight, and the two pray in a traditional Islamic fashion. That night, Brown is a ringside commentator and Cooke and Malcolm X are in the crowd as Clay upsets Liston, making him the world heavyweight champion.Afterward, Malcolm invites the other three men to his motel room. Cooke arrives first and, sitting alone in this rather rundown space, picks out a song on his guitar. The other three arrive together, and it's clear that the three guests are expecting a party, but that's dispersed when Malcolm makes it clear they are the only ones he invited. Malcolm wants to spend some time reflecting on their accomplishments, but tension between him and Sam arises. Malcolm accuses Sam of disloyalty to the black community by pandering to white audiences, and Sam argues that his method produces greater economic empowerment for black artists. Cassius informs the men of his plans to announce his conversion to the Nation of Islam, causing more tension. Malcolm steps out of the room, saying he'd left his camera in the car. His assistant-slash-bodyguard Kareem (Lance Reddick) accompanies him. Malcolm goes to a phone booth, telling Kareem he's going to call his wife. He explains that he wanted privacy to do that but didn't want to put the men out of the room. His young daughter answers the phone and he directs her to a note he'd stashed in the bookcase. Back in the motel room, the three men sip from a flask and discuss whether Malcolm is being a little too insistent about things. At one point another Nation of Islam member named Jamaal (Christian Magby) pops into the room, ostensibly to see if they need anything, but he's really looking for autographs. They ask him about the Nation of Islam life and whether he has any regrets. Jamaal says his one regret is that he didn't join up sooner.Back outside, Malcolm is still on the phone with Betty (Joaquina Kalakongo). He tells her that Cassius is going to announce his new religion, but he doesn't know whether Cassius will go along with his plans. From the phone booth, Malcolm spots a couple of white men at the edge of the parking lot and ends the call.Back in the motel room. Brown discusses his plans to become a film actor, and wonders if it will go smoothly. Cassius thinks he's being hired as a token character.Malcolm comes back into the motel room and says he might be being followed. He begins to check the room for bugs. They move to the roof and he talks about being harassed by the FBI, and a premonition he's having about conflict between himself and Elijah Muhammad. Then he tries to convince the others to join him on a pilgrimage to Mecca. Cassius appears to be in, but the other two decline because of their schedules.The conflict between Malcolm and Sam escalates into a scuffle, and Kareem appears out of nowhere with Jamaal to break it up. Their mere presence is enough to end things, largely by changing the focus of their anger. The men return to the motel room.As they argue, it becomes clear that Malcolm's antagonism of Sam is motivated, at least in part, by the activist's stress over his own life, especially his harassment by the FBI and fears about his schism with Elijah Muhammad. Malcolm is devastated to learn that Cassius is having second thoughts about his conversion, largely because of the heat that the Nation has been getting. The conflict between Malcolm and Sam begins to escalate. Malcolm ridicules the music Sam has produced since finding success. Sam insists his success and creative autonomy is itself an inspiration to the black community. What's more, he notes that the white co-opting of black-written songs works in the blacks' favor, because they wind up getting the lion's share of the royalties. Sam also points out the inherent hypocrisy in Elijah Muhammad living like a pharaoh but not doing much about the corruption in the city surrounding his huge house. And while he's sensitive to the struggles in the black community, protest songs aren't commercially viable. Malcolm counters by playing Bob Dylan's ""Blowin' In the Wind."" Sam angrily leaves the room.Cassius tells Malcolm that he went too far, but Malcolm protests that the time has come to quit standing on the fence. Cassius goes out to get Sam.

What's more, he's painfully aware that people still view him as a black man, not as an NFL hero.Cut to Sam and Cassius coming out of a liquor store. They're confronted by a couple of youngsters asking them for spare change. They get in the car and discuss Cassius' impending conversion to the Muslim religion, and the need for them to stick together.

They return to the motel room and announce that they're taking things to his room at the Fontainebleau. Malcolm asks him about the first time they met, then notes that he's been to five of Sam's shows, including one in Boston where he followed Jackie Wilson. Shortly after he started singing, the microphone cut out and apparently it was Jackie Wilson's doing. When the band abandoned him, he began to stomp the stage rhythmically and brought the crowd around to doing it with him. Then he started singing ""Chain Gang"" acapella. That's when he realized what a powerful future Sam had.Malcolm tells Cassius that he is planning to leave the Nation of Islam to form his own organization and asks him to join. Cassius angrily refuses, feeling betrayed by his mentor, and wondering if his conversion has been a ploy by Malcolm to attract attention to his new project. There's a knock at the door and Jamaal informs them that the press has gotten wind of the meeting. As Cassius prepares to talk to the media, he asks Malcolm to come with him. When they leave, Sam tells Jim that he has had similar thoughts about ""Blowin' in the Wind"" and has already written a song, but not yet performed it.After Cassius speaks with the press and announces his conversion, the men hit a nearby bar and genuinely celebrate. Malcolm participates but doesn't drink, and at one point he looks out the window, where he spots the same white men from earlier in the parking lot taking notes.In the aftermath of the night, Sam debuts ""A Change Is Gonna Come"" on The Tonight Show. Clay officially changes his name to Muhammad Ali, while Malcolm's life is thrown into chaos as he suffers the consequences of his split with the Nation of Islam; his house is firebombed, but he completes his autobiography. Jim leaves the NFL to pursue his movie career. The film ends with a title card with a quote from Malcolm on February 19, 1965, about the inevitability of martyrs for the cause, and that he was assassinated two days later on February 21."

Henry says it's okay and hugs her. She seems to snap out of it, realizing it's Henry, and she tells him that when the crash happened her last thought was ""shit"", it wasn't even about Dom, and she wonders if that makes her a bad person. He assures her it doesn't. She asks what Dom's last thought was, and Henry says it was of her.Grace takes a collection of her Dominic belongings and drops them into the pond, then strips her dress off, explaining she was going to marry Dominic in it, and Henry takes her home. At school, Mr. Sharma tells the paper that Grace is taking time off and when she comes back will not be returning to the paper. Grace eventually returns to school but he stays away from her. For his final essay for the paper, Henry says that every person has felt the loneliness and scariness of being a teenager. He says that scars are not a sign of what has been broken, but rather what has been created.On the last day of school, Grace and Henry finally talk about their future plans. He's going to Bennington, and she's taking a year off to continue therapy. She says she needs to find her words again, and he assures her she will. She tells him he's extraordinary and kisses him on the cheek, and they hug goodbye - she slips something into his pocket.

He leaves school, missing the bus, but his friends ditch the bus to walk home with him one last time."

However, Abe's clumsy style of work also leads to several mishaps, such as angering Patrick's father and being arrested for sneaking into Calvin's house. He eventually reaches a breakthrough when he realizes that a series of origami roses given to Caroline were not from Patrick, as she assumed, and are identical to ones that were received by Gracie shortly before her disappearance. When he also learns that the person he implicated in the theft of school fundraiser money as a child was actually innocent, he is able to deduce the identity of both Gracie's kidnapper and Patrick's killer as being high school principal Erwin.Abe confronts Principal Erwin at his home and reveals what he has learned. Erwin had become obsessed with Gracie and plotted to kidnap her. The theft of the school fundraiser money had been a test to see if Abe really was as good of a detective as people thought, and when he failed to solve the case correctly, Erwin felt confident in carrying out his plan. Caroline is, in fact, the product of Erwin's rape of Gracie and had secretly been left at a church by Erwin after her birth. When he found a lewd picture of Melody in Patrick's locker, he mistook it for Caroline and killed Patrick in revenge for ""ruining"" her. With his crimes revealed, and confronted by the fact that he murdered Patrick over a mistake, Erwin kills himself in front of Abe. Abe subsequently discovers Gracie, still alive, locked in a shed in Erwin's yard.Abe is hailed as a hero for solving the case and rescuing Gracie, restoring his respect in town and greatly boosting his agency's business. However, he is haunted by the recent events, and when his parents come to check on him, he breaks down sobbing as the movie ends.(copied from Wikipedia)"

Tesla,2020,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5259822/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A freewheeling take on visionary inventor Nikola Tesla, his interactions with Thomas Edison and J.P. Morgan's daughter Anne, and his breakthroughs in transmitting electrical power and light. In 1893, Nikola Tesla (Ethan Hawke) and a female companion are roller skating. A narrator explains that Tesla was inspired as a young boy when he was petting his cat and saw static electricity.Nine years prior, in 1884 New York City, Tesla is working for Thomas Edison (Kyle MacLachlan), who disregards Tesla's suggestions of using alternating current, and not want to pay him for the invention. Their co-worker explains that Edison's disapproval was partly because of the death of his wife, when they smash ice cream cones on each other, the narrator interrupts and says that isn't how it happened. She explains how Google searches on Tesla show very few photographs and usually the same head-shots. She goes into Tesla's childhood (Born in 1856 in a small village in Croatia. His father was a Serbian priest. His mother was brilliant, and Tesla had the gift for maths) and schooling (He studies Engineering in Prague), and also that he tried to start his own company (The Tesla Lighting Company) but failed (when his investors swindle him) and ended up having to dig ditches (phone lines for Western Union). Edison, on the other hand, has more popularity, twice as many search results, but lives a lavish lifestyle and married and widowed young with his first wife Mary (who died of a morphine overdose) (they met when she was 15 and died when she was 25).Edison meets Mina (Hannah Gross), his second wife (her father made his fortune in lawnmowers, and she was engaged to a preacher). In 1885, Tesla pitches his work on his magnetic induction motor to investors Brown (Ian Lithgow) and Peck (Michael Mastro). Edison paid him $!5/month. Brown and Peck sat up a lab for Tesla and pay him $250/month. Edison has 121 power stations across the US and Tesla plans to wipe him off.
Tesla and his assistant Anthony Szigeti (Ebon Moss-Bachrach) impress Professor Anthony (James Urbaniak), who suggests he break up the invention into several patents. He meets Anthony's daughter Evelyn (Emma O'Connor); and Anne Morgan (Eve Hewson), the daughter of J.P. Morgan (Donnie Keshawarz) and the film's narrator. JP Morgan is a Banker, and is pouring millions into Edison's General Electric company, installing DC current based systems in several cities in America.George Westinghouse (Jim Gaffigan), an inventor (he invented the air brakes for the railways and got rich as all the railways needed it) and businessman, buys Tesla's patents and fund production where the latter would get a royalty ($2.5 per horsepower) for every product installed in a home. He shares a rivalry challenge from Edison who claims that direct current is superior, and that alternating current is dangerous. Edison shows the Westinghouse invention as a capital punishment tool on William Kemmler (Blake Delong), who had killed his wife. Meanwhile, Tesla demonstrates his invention to an audience using two induction sticks that glow.
Edison testifies in court that Westinghouse Alternator produces 3000 V of electricity and is 3 times more than what is necessary to kill any human being. The lawyer, hired by Westinghouse, proves that Edison has no proof to suggest if the killing with be humane and hence should not be deployed for capital punishment cases.Szigeti invents a compass apparatus, but Tesla tells him it has already been invented, so Szigeti abandons his pursuits and seeks his fortune in South Africa.
The execution itself is a messy affair with Kemmler requiring multiple doses of electric current to be killed. It was much worse than hanging. Edison loses credibility when it is revealed that he advised the Govt on the design of the electric chair itself.
Anne gets to know Tesla more. Anne tries to get close to Tesla but wonders if any woman can achieve that as he still idolizes his mother. Anne tries hard to get close to Tesla, but he keeps pushing her away.
Tesla's invention is used to power's the World's Fair in 1893 in Chicago. 28 MM people walk through its pavilions and see that AC current is beautiful and safe. Edison meets with Tesla and admits he was wrong about alternating current, and then he offers to partner with Tesla. Anne clarifies that this meeting never happened: Edison neither apologized nor offered to join forces.Westinghouse tells Tesla that to keep his business going, he needs to do a merger, but has to cancel Tesla's contract regarding his horsepower royalties. Tesla tears up his contract as to him it was never about the money. Tesla didn't have a hustler on his side and was taken advantage of, in giving up his commercial interests. He didn't even consult his lawyers.
Sarah Bernhardt (Rebecca Dayan), a celebrity actress, records for Edison's gramophone. She meets Tesla at her event, but Edison is envious of Tesla and escorts her away.Later, Tesla oversees the design of the Niagara Falls hydroelectric power plant. J.P. Morgan asks Anne if she thinks Tesla is interested in romancing her. Anne talks with Tesla about it, but finds he has plans for another invention, but unfortunately, he is moving far away to Colorado. In 1899 Colorado Springs, he sets up his Tesla coil to harness and to transmit the power of the lightning storms. His experiments were trying to use Earth as a medium for power transmission and thereby free and unlimited energy for everyone, across the globe.Tesla meets up with Bernhardt who is touring the area. She shows interest in him, and invites him to attend her performance, but he does not show up. J.P. Morgan invests in his invention, giving him a check for 150,000 dollars (in 1901), which Tesla accepts.
In 1901, Edison's mining venture (To extract low grade iron ore from crushed rock) fails and he loses four million dollars. Tesla has not shown much progress in his work either, and even though Marconi has used Tesla's patents to transmit wireless signals, Tesla seems to be more interested in receiving and decoding signals he believes are from Mars. Anne tries to tell Tesla that he is trying to democratize energy and that idea is too revolutionary for how the current world is built.
He asks J.P. Morgan for more funding but is declined.There's a scene of Tesla singing to ""Everybody Wants to Rule the World"", along with montage stills from the film.
Realizing she has no future with Tesla, Anne moves to France to work with an organization helping children. She explains how Tesla outlived his peers but dies alone at 87 years old on Jan 7th, 1943. She reflects that today's world might be what he had imagined."

2067,2020,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1918734/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"One man's journey to the future to save a dying world. A lowly utility worker is called to the future by a mysterious radio signal, he must leave his dying wife to embark on a journey that will force him to face his deepest fears in an attempt to change the fabric of reality and save humankind from its greatest environmental crisis yet.—Calmirio In the year 2067, Earth has been devastated by climate change and an ongoing nuclear war. Only one city in the ruins of Australia has been able to hold out against these catastrophic changes, thanks to synthetic oxygen; this oxygen is tainted and gradually causes a deadly affliction known as ""The Sickness"".Ethan Whyte (Kodi Smit-McPhee) is a citizen who works as a manual laborer and who cares for his wife Xanthe (Sana'a Shaik), who is afflicted with the Sickness. One day, Ethan is called before Regina Jackson (Deborah Mailman), the Chief Technology Officer (CTO) of Chronicorp, a large corporation, who explains that the Sickness will eventually wipe out the remainder of humanity. During a test of the ""Chronical"", a prototype time machine that quantum physicist Richard Whyte (Aaron Glenane), Ethan's late father, had worked on before his death 20 years earlier, the scientists received a radio signal from over 400 years in the future with a message to specifically send Ethan to them. In hopes of preventing the extinction of humankind, Ethan is asked to be sent into the future. He refuses, as he resents his father for abandoning him and his mother, but Xanthe and Ethan's guardian and work colleague Jude (Ryan Kwanten) manage to change his mind.After surviving the traumatic time displacement, Ethan finds himself in a lush rain forest, with a hand-held computer named Archie and a wrist device given to him as a child by Richard as his only surviving pieces of equipment. He finds the entrance to a bunker-like structure, and a skeleton wearing his jumpsuit, a decaying Archie and the wrist device, and with a bullet hole in its skull. Shocked by the discovery of his apparent death in the near future, and sick from eating poisonous berries, Ethan is rescued by Jude, who followed him through time after his life readings, transmitted through the Chronical, were failing. After sharing their findings, they follow Archie's directions to another, still-functional door, which leads to the Chronical lab. Ethan's wrist device is revealed to be a DNA analyzer specifically made to grant him access to the Chronical, which sets itself for automatic reactivation in four hours.From a holographic recording left by Richard, the duo learns that the Chronical project originally entailed the reactivation of an atmospheric monitoring station which would ascertain the Earth atmosphere's breath-ability in the future and then transmit the data back to the past. When first activating the machine, Richard was surprised to receive a message to send his own son to the future, so despite his misgivings, he prepared Ethan's wrist analyzer. However, an immediate follow-up mission was rendered impossible because safely sending living matter through time required an operational link from both sides and the data showed a power failure in the year 2474.The Chronical's activation triggers a malfunction in its nuclear power core, threatening to unleash a nuclear explosion before the countdown is completed. Ethan and Jude make their way to the power core, which is located beneath the overgrown ruins of their home city. Finding the ruins littered with skeletons, including Xanthe's, they conclude that a cure against the Sickness was never found. When Jude attempts to comfort him, Ethan recognizes Jude's voice from a recording he found on the decaying Archie, taken moments before his future self was killed. Claiming that he's saving Ethan from himself, Jude directs Ethan at gunpoint to the reactor's control room. Unable to activate the emergency override, Ethan decides to go inside of airlock and pull the lever.With 37 minutes to spare, the duo return to the Chronical lab, where Ethan finds another exit that opens the entryway next to his skeleton. Ethan suffers a nervous breakdown and implores Jude to kill him, which Jude refuses to do. Jude then confesses that there was no actual hope of ever changing the future. Refusing to believe that, Ethan locks Jude in a room and plays back his father's log from the day that Richard died. Ethan learns that his mission was a sham from the beginning: Regina Jackson intended to flee from her dying time into the future with a ""chosen few"", while Richard maintained hope for humankind. To prevent its abuse, Richard keyed the time machine to Ethan's DNA, but when Richard's colleague announced that the machine could be rigged to send a person into the future one-way, Jackson killed Richard. Jude was appointed as Ethan's guardian to ensure that Ethan would be sent forward in time to repair the power failure and stabilize the time portal; once Ethan returned to 2067, Jackson would have him killed.Ethan tries to shut the Chronical down, but Jude moves to stop him. When Ethan refuses to fight him, Jude, guilt-ridden, commits suicide. Just before Jackson can put her plans in motion, Ethan sends the ""Send Ethan Whyte"" message into the past along with a copy of Richard's recorded murder on Archie, hundreds of live jungle plants, and a farewell gift to Xanthe. He destroys the Chronical, which changes the time-line: In the past, Jackson is arrested by the police after Archie transmits the recording to a news station, and the plants are used to revitalize the planet.In the future, Ethan's corpse is gone, and Ethan discovers his formerly ruined city 400 years in the future is advanced with architecture that is more harmonious with the natural environment. However, any future humans do not appear to be shown in the city."

Tensions and temperatures rise over the course of an afternoon recording session in 1920s Chicago as a band of musicians await trailblazing performer, the legendary ""Mother of the Blues,"" Ma Rainey (Academy Award® winner Viola Davis). Late to the session, the fearless, fiery Ma engages in a battle of wills with her white manager and producer over control of her music. As the band waits in the studio's claustrophobic rehearsal room, ambitious trumpeter Levee (Chadwick Boseman) - who has an eye for Ma's girlfriend and is determined to stake his own claim on the music industry - spurs his fellow musicians into an eruption of stories revealing truths that will forever change the course of their lives.

Before long, tempers flare and painful secrets come to light, and as the demanding diva shows up late for the session, trouble is brewing. As a result, insolent ambition, self-assured arrogance, a deep generation gap, and centuries of black oppression get in the way of stamping Ma's expressive, emotional voice on a vinyl record and wrap it up. But the defiant Mother of the Blues knows that she is the star of the show, and she won't be pushed around. After all, it's what Ma says that counts.—Nick Riganas On July 2, 1927,Ma Raineyis a highly regarded, strong willed blues singer who has recently been contracted by white producers. A recording session for songs by Ma is scheduled by her manager Irvin to take place at Paramount recording studios in Chicago. Seasoned Georgia Jazz Band members Toledo, Cutler, and Slow Drag arrive on time without Ma, frustrating her producer, Mel Sturdyvant. They are soon joined by Levee Green, the band's overconfident trumpeter who has shown Sturdyvant his original compositions in the hopes of breaking away from Ma and getting his own record deal. The rest of the band disapproves of this.Ma arrives an hour late with her girlfriend, Dussie Mae, and her nephew, Sylvester. Immediately, she clashes with Sturdyvant and her manager Irvin, making numerous demands. Insulted that the Coca-Cola she requested has not been provided, Ma refuses to begin the recording session, assigning Slow Drag and Sylvester to get her one. Later, she insists to Sturdyvant that the opening words of the album be spoken by Sylvester, who has a blocking stutter. As a result, the group has to do multiple takes of the song ""Ma Rainey's Black Bottom,"" much to everyone's frustration.Ma confides to Cutler that her white bosses are only interested in her voice, and would otherwise regard her as ""just a dog in the alley."" Meanwhile, Levee and Dussie Mae have sex in the practice room before being interrupted by Slow Drag.The group finally manages to get through the first track after multiple takes, but discovers an equipment failure has caused it not to be recorded. The band blames Levee, who they think tripped over a wire while eyeing Dussie, though it's revealed to have been separately damaged. Their argument leads to the religious Cutler telling a story about a preacher he once knew who got stranded in a small town and was humiliated by a group of white men who tore up his Bible and forced him to dance. Levee brushes off the story, saying that if there was a God, then he would care for Black people, which he never has. Cutler attacks Levee in anger, leading Levee to briefly brandish a knife in retaliation.The group finally finishes recording, but Ma fires Levee soon afterwards, believing his ambition and troublemaking to be detrimental to the band. Levee then meets with Sturdyvant about his original songs, but discovers that he will only purchase the songs, insisting that there is no market for them. Levee suffers a mental breakdown, and, after Toledo accidentally steps on his new shoes, Levee fatally stabs him in the back with the knife. Cutler and Slow Drag leave in horror as a regretful Levee cradles Toledo's corpse. Later, Sturdyvant records Levee's songs with a band consisting entirely of white men (supposedly Paul Whiteman's orchestra)."

She also reveals that she had, in fact, put something in the time capsule (a friendship bracelet that matched the bracelet Lara Jean put in the capsule) and was just too embarrassed to show it.

He states that he was waiting outside since she doesn't like driving in the snow, a fact that she told him on their first date, and says that she can break his heart if she wants to.

Superdeep,2020,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11815960/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A small research team went down below the surface to find out what secret the world's deepest borehole was hiding. What they have found turned out to be the greatest threat in history. And the future of humanity is in their hands. Set in 1984, Anna Fedorova, a Russian epidemiologist, tries to resign after her research associate Dr. Zotoff volunteered to test a vaccine on himself without preliminary or animal testing which resulted in his death.Later, Anna is celebrating New Year's eve with the family and friends and is congratulated on her being able to quickly develop a vaccine. She receives a call from the colonel telling her that they will leave shortly for the Kola bore hole. Sounds of an unknown origin were recorded deep beneath the surface and shortly after 20 people went missing. The bore hole is not only as the public believes it, but also a deep underground research lab. Anna is tasked with retrieving samples.Anna, the Colonel and a squad of soldiers led by Major Sergei Makeev are flown by helicopter to the ice covered facility in Murmansk. Upon landing, their helicopter is approached by a man in a lab coat who refuses to obey instructions. He is shot several times but continues towards the helicopter. He detonates a hand grenade, killing himself and causing minor damage to the helicopter and its passengers.Anna is told by a man named Zimin that they are being lied to. He states that it isn't a disease and that the lower levels of the facility are Hell. Anna, the Colonel, and the squad are met by the Deputy Head of Research of the facility Peter Kuznetsov and the man who reported Dr. Grigoriev's secrecy surrounding the disease. Dr. Grigoriev wants guarantees that the remaining employees sealed in the lower levels of the facility during the evacuation be rescued. He demonstrates that the pass codes have been changed and he is the only one that knows them.During the descent the elevators brakes don't respond and Dr. Grigoriev depressurizes the elevator and puts on an oxygen mask. The group passes out while Dr. Grigoriev escapes into the facility with the elevator key.When the group wakes up, they find an engineer named Nikolay and a doctor named Kira in the cafeteria who were left behind during the initial evacuation. There is still no sign of Dr. Grigoriev. Anna performs tests on Kira and Nikolay in the med lab and they show no signs of infection. Anna encounters Dr. Grigoriev who begs her to evacuate the others up the shaft and that he can't give her the elevator key. Anna yells for the others and Dr. Grigoriev is wounded and flees using the elevator. A group of soldiers lead by Egorov put on temperature protective suits and are about to descend through the shaft when the doors are opened from within the shaft. A lone lab assistant named Olga is found without any protective gear and is taken back to the med lab for observation and tests while Egorov and his team descend the shaft.Olga show signs of fever but declares that she is very cold. Her back is covered with mold-like growths which Anna takes a sample of. Dr. Grigoriev announces over the intercom that since they didn't evacuate to the surface through the shaft, that he has no choice but to seal them all within the facility. Dr. Grigoriev causes an explosion that damages the facilities pressure pump and will cause the facility to collapse within an hour. Upon returning to the med lab, Anna and the Major find the walls covered with mold with Olga half melted to the floor but still alive. Olga releases a cloud of spores and Anna is able to get to a gas mask but is soon attacked by Kira having been heavily infected and mutating in the same way as Olga. Anna discovers that the mold dies when exposed to cold and uses a fire extinguisher to leave the med lab and decontaminate herself while the Major is already showing signs of infection.Anna discusses the situation with the Colonel and explains that the mold can't survive in cold conditions and that the permafrost surrounding the facility is what is keeping it from spreading. The only way the mold can live is within a warm bodied host but if the host dies in a cold environment then the mold dies as well.As the group prepares to ascend through the shaft while wearing protective suits with the infected Major, they receive a radio broadcast from Egorov saying that they are under attack and not to open the door to the lower level shaft, even if it's them. Gunfire is heard shortly after and only two of the soldiers return saying they encountered something big, their weapons had no effect, and it now knows where they are. The third soldier returns missing an arm and slits his own throat before the door to the shaft closes. The soldiers, including the Major stay behind to fight whatever is chasing them while the rest descend in the elevator.Anna, Nikolay, Peter, and the Colonel successfully make it to the lower level. The group finds a wall of infected melted together, killed by the cold. The Colonel decides to go into the 200 degree environment to try and retrieve the elevator key that Dr. Grigoriev took with him. The protective suits have all been sabotaged by Dr. Grigoriev so the Colonel must go without protection. Anna, Peter, and Nikolay agree that even if they make it back, they must not tell anyone about the mold since someone will eventually try to research it and could endanger all life on earth.The Colonel does not return so Anna goes out into the 200 degree environment where the organism lives in order to retrieve the elevator key. She finds the Colonel dead with the key. Upon returning, Peter forces the other two by gunpoint to give him the key so he can return to the surface and become famous for discovering the mold. Peter is attacked by a large creature made up of screaming infected hosts that have all been melted into one organism. Anna hides in the cafeterias freezer, before taking the elevator key from Peter who has been absorbed. Anna finds Nikolay and together they barely escape the creature by getting on the elevator to the surface. They use the elevator key to begin their ascent but discover the Major melted into the floor. The Major begs that he not be allowed to the surface since it would cause the death of all life on the planet. Nikolay insists on escaping the facility no matter the cost and violently fights Anna over the elevators controls. The Major saves Anna by stabbing Nikolay through the neck, killing him. Anna now infected is dragged off by a hazmat team but not before being able to plummet the elevator. While being taken to the surface, Anna steals a grenade from one of the hazmat soldiers and forces them to let her go. Now outside in the cold and surrounded by soldiers, Anna pulls the pin on the grenade in order to kill the mold within her and keep its existence a secret. (copied from Wikipedia)"

But when secrets erode her short-lived joy, Grace's vulnerable side turns violent. Grace Waters (Crystal Fox), a longtime pillar of her Virginia community, stays composed when her ex weds his mistress and her son moves away. With convincing from her best friend Sarah (Phylicia Rashad), she tries putting herself first, and a handsome stranger (Mehcad Brooks) becomes her surprise second love. Yet any woman can snap, and Grace's new husband soon ravages her life, her work and - many say - her sanity. Shuttered in a cell awaiting trial for his murder, Grace's only hope for vindication lies with Jasmine Bryant (Bresha Webb), a public defender who has never tried a case. Co-starring Oscar nominee Cicely Tyson and writer/director Tyler Perry, A FALL FROM GRACE is a mesmerizing thriller built from unthinkable secrets.—Netflix Jasmine Bryant (Bresha Webb) is a public defender who constantly takes plea deals in small town Virginia. Her husband Jordan (Matthew Law) is a police officer who is feeling down after one of his recent victims jumps off a roof to her death. Jasmine is given a new case by her boss Rory (Tyler Perry) to defend Grace Waters (Crystal Fox) the woman accused of murdering her husband Shannon DeLong (Mehcad Brooks). Grace insists that she is guilty and will agree to a plea deal if she goes to a prison close by her son Malcolm (Walter Fauntleroy). Jasmine is troubled by the details of the case, including the fact that Shannon's body was never found. Rory is not pleased that Jasmine wants to try the case because the department does not have the budget for a trial, in addition to the media frenzy.Grace's best friend Sarah Miller (Phylicia Rashad) tells Jasmine that Grace was feeling sad after her divorce and she pushed her to get out and meet someone new, which led her to Shannon. After researching the case some more, Jasmine and her colleagues Tilsa (Angela Marie Rigsby) and Donnie (Donovan Christie, Jr.) believe Grace is innocent. Grace tells Jasmine how she met Shannon at his artwork exhibition at an art gallery. They began dating as he charmed Grace with nice words and wine. After they married three months later, Shannon gradually became cruel and secretive from Grace. Eventually, Grace was fired from her job at the bank after Shannon secretly stole from her accounts using her passwords, and he also mortgaged her house with forged documents. Finally, Grace walked in on Shannon in their bed with another woman. That evening, in anger, Grace beat Shannon with a baseball bat multiple times and threw him down the stairs to her basement. Grace then drove to the middle of nowhere to call Sarah and inform her that she killed her husband. Sarah explains that she went to Grace's house and witnessed her son Malcolm leaving the house. Because Shannon's body is missing, Sarah believes that Malcolm helped Grace dispose of it.At the trial, Jasmine miserably fails at proving Grace's innocence. Calling Sarah as a witness backfires because phone records show numerous phone calls between the women on the night of the murder, and Sarah finally admits on the stand that Grace confessed to killing Shannon to her. Grace is found guilty by the jury. Feeling defeated, Jasmine stops by Sarah's house (a residence for old ladies) and notices an elderly woman named Alice (Cicely Tyson) trying to escape from the house. Alice wants to leave the house and reveals that other women have died there, including Shane Fieldman (Jordan's victim from the beginning of the film). When Jasmine discovers there are numerous elderly women locked up in the basement, she is kidnapped. Jordan discovers Sarah's criminal history and searches for his wife. Shannon turns out to be alive and is revealed to be Sarah's son. Jordan knocks on the door and asks Sarah if Jasmine is there and she denies it. When Jordan calls her, he hears her phone ringing from inside the house, so he bursts in, tussles with Sarah, handcuffs her, and then looks for Jasmine as Sarah escapes. Jordan and Shannon fight as Jasmine tries to break free. Shannon is shot and is presumably killed.As the police rescue the elderly women, it is revealed that Sarah and Shannon are really mother and son criminals Betty and Maurice Mills, who have been kidnapping elderly women for their social security information and conning middle aged women out of their life savings for over 25 years with Grace being one of those middle aged women. Grace gets one more hearing and this time, Jasmine succeeds at defending Grace by presenting new evidence that Grace was victimized by Betty and Maurice's scheme to steal her life savings, and another piece of evidence that reveals that Betty and Maurice are wanted in several states for stealing from other numerous women, which is enough for the judge to grant Grace her freedom. While everyone celebrates Grace's freedom, Rory congratulates Jasmine for uncovering such a crazy scheme. Meanwhile, Betty is on the run from the police and has just been hired to take care of an elderly woman in a nursing home.(Copied from Wikipedia)"
Vanguard,2020,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9695722/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Covert security company Vanguard is the last hope of survival for an accountant after he is targeted by the world's deadliest mercenary organization. Qin Guoli (Jackson Lou), a Chinese accountant based in Great Britain, has been forcibly contracted by Maasym, leader of the terrorist organization Brothers of Vengeance, to finance his projects (like selling oil or historical artifacts. Maasym wanted Qin to help him buy weapons of mass destruction). After Qin had tipped off Scotland Yard, Maasym was killed in a military operation by US forces, but his son Omar (Eyad Hourani) has survived and now wants to get his hands on his father's money, whose whereabouts are solely known to Qin. Omar has hired the mercenary gang Arctic Wolves, who kidnap Qin and his new wife Meiwei during London Chinatown's Chinese New Year festival.Vanguard, an international security company assigned to protect Qin, sends agents Zhang Kaixuan (Ai Lun), Lei Zhenyu (Yang Yang) and Mi Ya (Miya Muqi) to rescue him. After the operation's successful conclusion, Qin asks Vanguard's director Tang Huanting (Jackie Chan) to protect his daughter Fareeda (Xu Ruohan), who is currently in Africa, before Omar can use her as leverage against him.Tang, Lei, and Mi Ya travel to Africa and find Fareeda, but also have to contend with the Arctic Wolves and a poaching gang (led by Tunda (Tomer Oz)) who have been hired as additional muscle (Fareeda is an animal activist and hence on the hit list of poachers). During the chaotic first altercation, Lei and Fareeda are separated from the rest of the group and hide out in the nearby jungle, forcing Tang and Mi Ya to search for them on foot, guided by satellite tracking provided by Vanguard headquarters.
Tang and Mi Ya re-join their companions and fight their pursuers in a furious river chase with an amphibian car and jet skis, which ends with Tang and Mi Ya getting stranded and Lei and Fareeda being captured. Broto (Brahim Achabbakhe), the leader of the Arctic Wolves, proposes to trade his captives for Qin, which Qin immediately agrees to.Tang rallies his agents to storm Omar's fortress in the Middle Eastern city of Jiadebala and rescue the hostages. With some local help, the Vanguard operatives infiltrate the heavily guarded stronghold (via the sewer lines) and make preparations for the next day's exchange.
However, Omar and Broto have expected an intervention, and the operation quickly escalates into a running gun battle. When Vanguard is encircled and overwhelmed, Qin gives himself up to enable the agents to escape.
Tang, Lei, Zhang, Mi Ya and Fareeda travel to Dubai, where Maasym has deposited his fortune, and cooperate with the local police to watch two Arctic Wolves mercenaries who have arrived there to facilitate a major arm deal for Omar with Maasym's money. Maasym had made a deposit for a major arms deal, but was killed before the deal went through. Omar agrees to complete the deal with payment of $ 200 M in gold.
Incidentally, this also gives Omar an opportunity to kill Admiral Greg Dawes (Eric Heise), the man who killed Maasym and who has just arrived in Dubai.Heavily followed by both sides, Omar, Broto and Qin meet with arms dealer Josef (Jeffrey Gullbrand) at a second-hand car dealership, where the money has been converted into cars made of pure gold; in return for his fee (paid in the form of 2 gold cars worth $ 100 M each), Josef provides Omar with the control system for a missile attack drone, which the latter wishes to use against Dawes.
Dubai police executes a strike against the terrorists, but their approach gives Omar's party plenty of time to activate the drone and then escape in the gold cars. The Vanguard agents move out to intercept the terrorists, and due to forewarning by the Dubai police, US forces intercept and destroy the drone. The chase ends inside a shopping mall, where Omar and Broto are overpowered and arrested, and the film concludes with the protagonists celebrating the Chinese New Year in Dubai."

Meander,2020,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5752192/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A woman finds herself locked in a series of strange tunnels full of deadly traps. A woman is lying in the middle of the road when a car approaches, before it reaches her she stands and moves aside. The car pulls up beside her and the man inside offers her a lift. They introduce each other as Lisa and Adam. She notices he has a tattoo of a cross on his hand. They speak, and Lisa reveals her daughter Nina had died and today would have been her ninth birthday. After a while, Lisa turns on the radio and hears a report of a man who has murdered two people. The report describes a man with a cross tattoo on his right hand and Lisa realises it is Adam, who slams the brakes throwing Lisa against the dashboard.Lisa wakes up in a small room with strange lights on the walls and seemingly no way out. She has a strange device attached to her wrist emanating a yellow light. After a while, a door slides open and reveals a narrow tunnel. Lisa crawls into the tunnel and the door closes behind her. The device on her wrist sounds an alarm and a timer briefly flashes showing 11 minutes counting down.Lisa crawls through the tunnel overcoming various obstacles like an incredibly narrow passage she must squeeze through, a platform that begins to slowly rise and almost crushes her against the ceiling, a rotting body blocking her way that falls apart as she tries to move it.At one point the tunnel ahead of her is blocked and the device on her wrist glows red and begins to countdown from 60. The walls are suddenly lined with tubes that appears to be heating up, and a section of the wall behind her opens. She quickly scrambles into the space as a glass barrier closes her in and the tunnel behind her is filled with flames.She carries on through a section that is flooding with water, and an acid pit with only a thin ledge on either side to crawl along and eventually hears a man calling out. She finds herself trapped behind a barrier, the man trapped behind another barrier in front of her, and an open stretch of tunnel between them. The man is clearly losing his mind, his hair is long and he has a beard indicating he has been in this place for a long time. A section of wall opens up in the tunnel between them and fire tubes line the walls, both of their barriers lift at the same time and they race to the safe space. After a struggle, Lisa gains the upper hand and forces the man into the tunnel. The glass barrier drops down severing his arm that was attached to the device. She sees a tattoo of a cross on the hand and realises it was Adam, who is burned alive as the fire fills the tunnel. She then passes out.She wakes up in the same safe space. A skull, attached to a mechanical tentacle, appears from the ceiling and heals her wounds. It then attaches itself to a part of her suit and Lisa experiences a flashback of Adam attacking her with a knife, her being stabbed and falling from the car, and a strange light in the sky.She leaves the safe space and takes Adam's arm with her, she examines it and sees there are three markings - a diamond, a cross, and a diamond - underneath the device attached to it. Suddenly, a spinning blade appears in front of her, forcing her to move quickly backwards. She narrowly escapes into a tunnel above.A section above her opens up, and a strange creature crawls into the tunnel with her and lies still behind her. It begins to chase her and she crawls through a small section of the tunnel that it cannot fit through. It appears to be human but badly burned; its eyes are white and glossed over. It's missing an arm, hinting that it is Adam, reanimated somehow.She comes to a section with two tunnels to choose from, remembering the markings on Adam's arm she tries to work out which to take. She chooses the left, and hears her daughter Nina's voice. Lisa follows the voice into a bright white room that shows images of her life, from herself as a baby looking up at her father, to seeing her daughter fall to her death from a window.The burned Adam creature appears above her and descends into the room and gives chase through a tunnel. At the end of the tunnel is bright cloudy sky, but the tunnel itself is lined with razor sharp wire. With no choice but to push forward to escape the creature, Lisa forces her way through the wires, badly injuring herself. Finally, she cannot move just feet from escape. Fire tubes appear from the walls, a safe space opens up which the creature rolls into, and Lisa closes her eyes and waits to die. Just before the flames hit, the floor opens up and she falls to safety.She wakes up in the same room she started in. Badly injured, she writes the symbols she had seen in blood on the wall for someone else to find after her. The skull appears and begins to heal her but she tells it she wants to die as she wipes the symbols from the wall, it is about to inject - seemingly to euthanise her - when Lisa notices she has only partially wiped the symbols. It was not a two diamonds and a cross, it was 6 arrows indicating directions to take. She tells the skull to stop and, rejuvenated, she sets out again. She easily passes the same obstacles as before, this time knowing how to overcome them.When she reaches the acid pit, she burns off the clasp of her wrist device and discovers her own set of markings underneath - two crosses and a diamond telling her which directions to take. The creature begins to give chase again as Lisa reaches the split in the tunnel, she throws her removed device down one tunnel to lure the creature and takes the other.She comes across a strange biological door that leads into a womb like room. She crawls inside and strange creatures - possibly aliens - can be seen moving on the other side of the walls of the womb. She leaves the womb by another exit and enters a similar room, where she notices her wrist device on the floor and the creature stuck in a door ahead of her. She slowly retrieves the device, but it sets off an alarm which rouses the creature and it gives chase again.They move into a tunnel that again lines the walls with fire tubes. Lisa escapes into the safe room and the glass falls down, but this time the fire doesn't come and the glass opens again and she is pushed back out in to the tunnel with the creature. She wrestles with it, placing her foot on its head as the wall presses them both into the main tunnel. Its head is crushed against the wall, killing it.Lisa uses the marking on her wrist to find her way. She eventually finds her daughter Nina playing with a ball. She realises her daughter is not real and tells her she has to leave another way. The daughter hugs her, telling her ""I'm proud of you, Lisa. We all are"", then disappears.Lisa crawls into one final tunnel with three blades falling at faster intervals. The first is every 4 seconds and she makes it through. The second is every 3, she gets by it. The third is every 2 which seems impossible. Just ahead is the exit with bright blue sky. Determined, she forces herself to try and almost makes it, but her foot is severed in half. She crawls to the exit, weak with loss of blood, and finds it is merely a screen with a video of a sky.She begins to cry as the tunnel fills with flame tubes.Suddenly, the ceiling opens up and she begins to float upward into a bright light. She wakes up outside on a rock under a bright blue sky. Her foot is healed. Nina appears before her. Lisa asks her if she has died. Nina tells Lisa that her body died many times, but she is safe now. Lisa asks her what she is supposed to do. Nina says ""Live"".The camera pans up, revealing that they are on a beautiful alien planet. (copied from Wikipedia)"

Jack (Peter Vack) is an internet gambler living in New York City who becomes fixated on Scarlet (Julia Fox), a cam girl from San Francisco.

Due to his addiction, he is constantly behind on rent and is forced to eat ramen noodles for most of his meals.Jack visits several models on the cam site, but seems mainly interested in Scarlet, often getting dressed up for their sessions. When Scarlet greets him with her usual dominatrix routine, Jack asks if she can drop the act and talk to him like a normal person. She says she will if he donates her 200 tokens, to which he complies. In the ensuing conversation, Scarlet reveals that she used to enjoy painting and Jack notes that that is awesome. When she asks what he does, he lies and says he is a tech developer working on a chip called See Stream that would allow people to exchange thoughts by just thinking about them. Scarlet is impressed and wishes she was as passionate about something as he is about See Stream.While Jack's landlord, Henry (Atticus Cain), is taking measurements of Jack's apartment, he mentions that he will not renew Jack's lease and that a painter is going to come by in a week to repaint the walls. Jack casually mentions that his roommate, Joe, has passed away.ONE WEEK LATERJack wakes up in his underwear to find the painter repainting the walls a bright blue. He and the painter, Will (Kevin Moccia), strike up a small friendship as Will talks about his odd life experiences. While the painter leaves for the day, Jack has another session with Scarlet, where they appear to be talking as friends. He continues to lie about the progress of See Stream which leads Scarlet to mention that she was thinking about it in her personal life, which excites Jack.While Will is working on the walls the next day, Jack agrees to show him how to play blackjack. Will gives him some money to play with and invites over his friend, Larry (Buddy Duress). While Jack is playing in front of them, he goes on a hot streak, but quickly loses most of his own money when he starts playing by himself. Since he can't afford a session with Scarlet, he resorts to looking at the pictures he has saved of her on his laptop.To clear his head, Jack goes on a walk throughout the streets of New York where he sees Scarlet get out of a car in front of him. He follows her to a bodega where she buys a pack of beer and then he continues to follow her unnoticed until he loses her in an empty street. He quickly goes home and messages her on the cam site that he saw her in New York and asks if she's enjoying the beer. She doesn't respond, which leads to him putting out a cigarette in his mouth and talking to other cam girls. However, he can't get over Scarlet, so he masturbates to her pictures and frequently visits the bodega in hopes of running into her again.An old lover of Jack's, Emma (Nikki Belfiglio), invites him to attend one of her art shows, to which Jack agrees. He brings along Will and Larry, the latter of which hits on Emma and starts play fighting with Jack in the middle of the art studio. Emma breaks up the fight and Jack spends the rest of the show admiring the various types of art. After the show, Emma and Jack go back to her apartment and start talking when Jack asks her to run to the store and grab a bottle of wine. While she's gone, Jack logs onto the cam site on her computer and asks Scarlet if she's available for a session. Scarlet finally responds, so her and Jack start conversing. She tells Jack that he must have saw her doppelganger, because she has never been to New York. They then start engaging in foreplay and Jack uses one of Emma's books to ejaculate into. Emma returns to her apartment and finds Jack sitting awkwardly, asking if he can borrow the book that he just came into. Emma rubs his shoulders, but he gets a phone call from Scarlet and quickly leaves her apartment.Jack returns home and hops onto a session with Scarlet. She shows him the paintings that she has started doing and Jack is severely impressed. Over the next couple of days, Scarlet shows Jack more of her paintings and he talks about his love of Beethoven. He also shows Scarlet to Will and Larry. When Jack asks her how she started being a dom, she tells him that when she was little, she would torture the kids who got picked on the most. Jack then says that he knows it was her that he saw in New York, but she continues to deny it. He proposes a game: if he can take a picture of her in New York, he will take her on a vacation to Paris. She agrees, but is adamant that she's never been to New York.Jack comes home one day and finds Will and Larry waiting in his apartment. Will wants Jack to make enough money on blackjack to pay for his son's college tuition. Jack thinks it's a bad idea, but Will and Larry convince him. They start gambling that night until they get a noise complaint from Henry.After Will and Larry leave for the night, Jack tells Scarlet over the phone that he feels like she is making him a better person. They then start video chatting and she says she is thinking about quitting camming. Jack is initially supportive, but hears a door close in the background of her video. He asks who's there, but she says that she's alone. He starts yelling at her to turn her camera, but she gets upset and ends the call. After she ends the call, her boyfriend, Duke (Keith Poulson), asks her why she is camming in their bedroom and not her den. He also tells her that he finally got his liquor license and since they have a lot saved up, they can open up their theatre. Duke asks Scarlet if she can get some extra funds from Jack, since they're both under the assumption that Jack is a wealthy Wall Street businessman.As Duke and Scarlet are sitting in on a rehearsal of one of the plays, Scarlet realizes that the scene is ripped straight from her and Duke's personal life, with the male character continuously calling the female character a whore for being a sex worker. Scarlet is understandably upset that Duke never told her the play was about her.While Scarlet is taking a walk in frustration, she visits Emma's art show, confirming to the audience that she does live in New York. She also asks Jack for his address so she can look him up on maps. She returns to her apartment and starts video chatting with Jack. However, this time around, he is the one giving the orders, telling her to take off her clothes and pleasure herself. They continue to masturbate simultaneously. Jack then shows Scarlet Joe's old room. She asks what happened to him and Jack reveals that he committed suicide. He also tells her that Joe believed every relationship was exploitative and based on selfish gain.While Scarlet is talking with the play manager, Sandra (David J. White), she learns that they need more money or all of their work will have been for nothing. As they're leaving the same bodega Jack first saw Scarlet in, Larry recognizes Scarlet and follows her back to her apartment. He then calls Jack and gives him her address.Jack sneaks into the building (which is also the theatre) and begins looking around. He finds Scarlet's den and starts playing with her toys before sitting at her desk and messing with her computer. He then enters a door and ends up in her apartment. As he's looking around, the front door opens, forcing him to hide under the couch. Scarlet and Duke enter and start talking about the play, eventually sitting down on the couch that Jack is under. While talking, Duke reveals to Scarlet that he set up a few different accounts so that he could cam with her. Scarlet is upset, because he was wasting her time and could've been making more money instead. Duke follows Scarlet into the bedroom to make it up to her which gives Jack a chance to sneak out unnoticed.When he returns home, he gets a call from Scarlet who asks him to fly her out to New York. As he's asking if she's serious, he gets a buzz at his door. He lets the person in and opens the front door to find Scarlet standing there, much to his surprise. She looks around his apartment and tells him to take a picture of her so that they can take their vacation to Paris. They spend the night snuggled up against each other. When they wake up, Jack tells her to look at ticket prices on his computer while he cleans out his apartment. When Scarlet's finished, she says she needs to step outside to get some fresh air and Jack says he'll join her since he needs to go to the ATM. While Jack is trying to withdraw cash from the ATM, Scarlet walks off and gets into a car. Duke leans out the car window and calls Jack a pervert.It's revealed that while Scarlet was pretending to look at flights to Paris, she was actually transferring $10,000 from Jack's bank account to her cam site profile. Jack chases after the car as it drives away, but can't catch up. As Duke and Scarlet are driving away, Duke is very excited to have the money, but Scarlet is visibly upset about stealing from Jack. Jack calls his bank and tells them that the $10,000 transferral was a fraudulent charge, but they point out that other charges to that site have been confirmed so they can't do anything about it. Jack is forced to call Will and tell him that he lost all of the money for his son's tuition.As Jack is wandering the streets of New York aimlessly, Scarlet -- having now left Duke -- texts him that she can help him out. He tells her to meet him at a motel with the $10,000. When she shows up, she informs him that she doesn't have the money and he tells her to get out. She refuses and instead tries to calm him down. She tells him that she thought he was rich, which leads Jack to reveal that See Stream was all a lie to impress her.Both growing more and more upset, Scarlet tells Jack that she knows he broke into her house. He denies the claim, but Scarlet says that he checked his email at her computer and Jack begins laughing at his own idiocy. They both encourage each other to call the police as they both feel they are in the right, but neither actually does.After they calm down, Jack asks Scarlet about her real name, but she says that she likes the name Scarlet more than her real name. He then asks if they can have sex and she says yes. However, as she is giving him a blow job, Jack can't get hard. Scarlet then starts playing Beethoven and reverts back to her old dominatrix routine by treating Jack as a slave and tapping out her cigarette in his mouth. This turns Jack on and they start masturbating alongside each other. As the credits begin to roll, Jack calls Will and tells him that he and Scarlet will get the money for Will's son's tuition."

Ali and Max activate the fire alarm to summon the fire department but as Ali tries to alert them, two other henchmen catch the two and the firefighters find nothing amiss and leave after Borz explains that it was the false alarm. After Ali kills another, Max is separated and is recaptured and brought to the room. Dubois calls Ali via the PA system, ordering her to surrender herself. Seeing the water hose is connecting to the drill bit, Max surreptitiously uses the PA system as a Morse code to message Ali to disable the main valve of the water supply. Leo is killed by the nail bomb set by Ali while attempting to turn the water back on, destroying the main valve as well. Dubois radios her and threatens to kill the family if Ali refuses to restore the water supply. Ali agrees and, with corrupt NYPD officer Olsen (Dubois' cohort) at gunpoint, connects the hose from the rooftop water tank. The safe is opened, revealing the paintings. After realizing their true value the mercenaries agree that 50% of the proceeds will go to Dubois while the remaining men, Martinez and Borz, will only receive a share of 25%. Ali then kills Olsen and rushes to the room where she holds Martinez hostage. Borz injures Jon and kills Martinez to increase his share to 50%.As the police arrive at the scene, Borz dresses as a doorman to walk past the police and pins the blame on Ali, who incapacitates the officers and chases Borz. As they walk through the sewer, Borz turns on Dubois and kills him. Ali fights Borz and finally kills him with a grenade. Sometime later, Ali bids farewell to Jon and his children, who are heading to London.(copied from Wikipedia)"

Raat Akeli Hai,2020,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt12567088/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The film follows a small town cop who is summoned to investigate the death of a politician which gets complicated by the victim's secretive family and his own conflicted heart. An aged and rich politician is found dead on his wedding night with a very young girl. A local cop is assigned the task to investigate the crime. As all circumstantial evidence points towards the young bride, our cop is hell bent on opening the Pandora's box and digs in to an old unresolved case putting him at risk.—Fella_shibby@yahoo.com The film starts with a car being followed by a truck. The truck hits the car and the car flips over. A man alights (Ravi Sah) and brutally kills both the driver and the lady who were in the car. The killer then takes the bodies to a factory and burns them with acid. While doing so, he accidentally spills acid on one of his own hands.Five years Later, Inspector Jatil Yadav (Nawazuddin Siddiqui) is seen attending the wedding of his colleague Narendra Singh (Shree Dhar Dubey) where Jatil's mother Sarita Kumari (Ila Arun) is desperately searching for a girl to set him up with for marriage. Jatil is irritated and embarrassed and rushes his mother home to avoid further interference in his personal life. While eating dinner, Jatil gets called by the SSP Lalji Shukla IPS (Tigmanshu Dhulia) to investigate a high-profile murder of a rich aristocrat named Raghuveer Singh (Khalid Tyabji).Jatil learns that Raghuveer was murdered by his own gun on his wedding night and is further intrigued by the family's silence and lack of knowledge on the matter. Jatil Yadav is first introduced to the family by Ramesh Chauhan (Swanand Kirkire), brother of Raghuveer Singh's first wife (who was murdered 5 years ago).
Members of Raghuveer's family include his two children - Karuna Singh (Shweta Tripathi) (daughter of Raghuveer Singh) and Karan (son of Raghuveer Singh), Chunni (Riya Shukla) (the maid of the house), Pramila Singh (Padmavati Rao) (wife of Raghuveer Singh's brother and Raghuveer Singh's sister-in-law), Vasudha (Shivani Raghuvanshi) and Vikram Singh (Nishant Dahiya) (daughter and son of Pramila), Ravi Sisodia (Gyanendra Tripathi) - the volatile husband of Karuna, and Radha (Radhika Apte) - the young bride of Raghuveer Singh.
Starting the interrogation, it is revealed to Jatil that Vikram was the first one to discover Raghuveer's dead body. As per Vikram's story, he went to drop off his fiance (daughter of the notorious MLA Munna Raja (Aditya Srivastava)) at around 9:30. He returned around 11:15 and then took the ladies of the house to a temple at 12:30.It was after this that Vikram says that he found his uncle Raghuveer dead. He also says that there was wedding procession crossing in-front of the house at 10:30. Jatil eventually finds out about back stairs which connects directly to a water tank and wonders if that route was used to carry out any suspicious business. Ravi is livid and blames Radha for the death and wants to throw her out of the house.
During Jatil's investigation, he begins to question Radha (he deduces that Radha was Raghuveer's mistress and now the owner of all his property). Jatil develops a soft spot for her as something tells him that she is being made a scapegoat by Raghuveer's family. Radha is treated like an outsider by the family, who resents her. After first refusing to cooperate, Radha remembers something that connects her to Jatil and gives the chit to Chunni to pass to Jatil. On the chit, the address of Radha is written and he distinctly remembers that he had saved Radha five years earlier, when she attempted suicide by jumping off a train. This further leads him to believe that Radha is an innocent and emotionally disturbed girl who is getting caught in the crossfire of what seems to be developing into an insidious plot. Further into his investigation, Jatil finds out that Raghuveer's first wife was killed during a robbery when she was coming back from Gwalior towards Kanpur.Jatil also learns that Raghuveer's son Karan had once been apprehended with drugs. Jatil realizes that there's more to Raghuveer's complicated family than what meets the eye.
The next day, during the investigation, Jatil finds erotic magazines in Raghuveer's cupboard and some photos of women and a plastic bead below the bed. He also learns that Radha was sold by her father and one of the photos is of Radha with a bruised back which he found earlier. Radha continues to refrain from telling Jatil anything. Later, Munna Raja comes in after Ravi Sisodia calls him in response to Jatil's no-nonsense investigation style.
While investigating the manor, Jatil also spots a senile older woman who was earlier the maid of house. The old maid's son was the driver of the car when Raghuveer's first wife was returning from Gwalior to Kanpur and she is grandmother of Chunni. Jatil continues to investigate. Forensics tell Jatil that Raghuveer was murdered between 10pm and 12pm with his own gun and blunt marks were due to because he was hit by butt of the same gun.Phone records reveal that Vikram received a phone call from his uncle at 11:30 and many phone calls from an unknown number which is identified as Radha's. No fingerprints were found on gun or on Raghuveer's phone. Jatil is perplexed that Raghuveer was shot and no one heard a thing. This could only happen when there was a lot of noise in the house between 10 pm and 11 pm. After 11 pm the house was quiet. Yet, Vikram insists that Raghuveer called him at 11 30 PM.
Jatil takes Vikram for questioning after determining that Vikram and Radha were having an affair behind Raghuveer's back. Vikram's call records place him at the site of the murder at 11 PM as well and Jatil says that He and Radha killed Raghuveer to get him out of the way. But Vikram says that cell phone tracking is not accurate, and that he got a call from Raghuveer's phone at 11 30 PM. Jatil has no evidence. Jatil is also perplexed that there are no fingerprints on Raghuveer's phone.During an interrogation with Chunni, Jatil finds she was the one who took the lamp up to Raghuveer's room and came back with the lamp which broke down on the stairs. She also refrains from divulging anything related to the current investigation, but does say she couldn't even see her father who died in that road accident and case got closed. She indicates that the family will kill her the same way they killed her father, if she says anything.
Jatil starts investigating the death of Raghuveer's first wife and her driver. He finds that another city's police had reported a similar car and it was filed as hit and run case. The station has the evidence from the case, which includes parts of a truck. The truck markings reveal that it is from Jajmau, Kanpur. This leads him to a tannery in Jajmau which is run by a butcher, but was originally owned by Munna Raja.Further investigation into the family reveals that Karuna doesn't like her aunt Pramila and her cousin Vikram's interference since they are constantly eyeballing her. Karuna says that Pramila is ruthless and will do anything for Vikram. Later, Jatil finds a medical report and in the morning Chunni is found dead near the back stairs. He later fights with his colleague Narendra (After Jatil alleges that Munna Raja was involved in the death of Raghuveer's first wife and her driver) and openly tells the SSP that he will find the truth. Later he is attacked by the goons and calls Narendra for help, but Narendra ignores him and he tells him that he is going to arrest Radha. Jatil immediately warns Radha to run, but before she can run away Ravi chases her and she locks herself in a room. Jatil comes in time to take her away, but goons continue to chase them. They are able to catch a train though unknown to them one of the goons (The butcher) also catches the train. Later in the night Radha wakes up to see Jatil is missing. She takes her knife with her and finds Jatil being attacked by the Butcher working for Munna Raja. Both overpower the Butcher and throw him out of the train. Jatil and Radha reach Raghuveer's Gwalior farmhouse. During this time Narendra Singh is investigating the murder of Chunni and forensics tells him about the dead skin found in her fingernails leading him to the conclusion that the suspect is a man with burnt skin.Narendra makes the report and goes to SSP, but he sees the man having fingernail marks on burnt hand in the office of SSP with Munna Raja. He goes to Chunni's grandmother and shows her the photo of the man. He informs about all of this to Jatil. In the meantime Jatil finds a piece of a dress in Radha's bag having the same bead he found earlier, he confronts her that she was in fact in the room and she lied, she confesses that she and Vikram had an affair and planned to elope with Vikram but he didn't as he planned to marry MLA's daughter, seeing this she got furious and called Vikram to come and talk, he returned as soon as he dropped his fiance and parked the car and without anyone noticing took the back stairs and confronted Radha. As she was going to enter the room to tell Raghuveer about the affair, the lights went out and Chunni comes upstairs with the lamp. As the electricity comes back, they all find Raghuveer already dead. Vikram tells her to go downstairs and meanwhile Vikram tells Chunni to call on his cell from Raghuveer's phone.After this, while returning Chunni drops the lamp on the stairs. Vikram takes the backstairs and returns by the main gate and asks the women to come to go for the temple. Later Jatil informs SSP that he has made Radha surrender in another police station.
Jatil finally gets time to open the medical report and finds the medical report under the name of Raghuveer's first wife and report was of abortion, and abortion was done one day before the accident. He inquires about it from her brother Ramesh who tells him that she was here with him as Karan caught malaria but left all of a sudden to Kanpur. Ramesh had called his sister that night on phone, and says he heard horns of the train but contradicting to this she was travelling by car.
Jatil also inquired the caretaker of the farmhouse who told that she ordered him to call whenever Raghuveer came with another woman. Investigating the farmhouse, he finds the same erotic magazines, Polaroid photos, Polaroid camera and a badge of a boarding school. He visits the abortion clinic as well and watches the wedding video, too.He learns that Radha is being taken by police under the bridge on the orders of SSP. As Radha is being taken by Narendra Singh under the bridge the same van comes who were chasing Jatil with the butcher in it. The butcher comes out and inspect the van as he opens the van to take out Radha, Jatil who all along was accompanying her (with the help of Narendra) comes out and attacks resulting in cross-firing in which Radha gets injured but butcher escapes. As soon as butcher reaches his home Chunni's grandmother comes from back and throws oil onto him and burns him alive.In the climax, Radha comes with Jatil in the bungalow with everyone present he starts to tell the truth, He confronts Ravi Sisodia first that he is one who gave drugs to Karan and later the school caught him and Raghuveer bailed him out. It was in fact the butcher who killed both Raghuveer's first wife and driver and burnt the bodies in the tannery on the orders of Munna Raja. Mrs. Raghuveer was tipped off by the caretaker about a female whom Raghuveer brought in the farmhouse. On peeping through a window, Mrs. Raghuveer finds out the woman is none other than Vasudha, Pramila's daughter. Vasudha was sexually abused many times by her uncle Raghuveer who took perverse photos of her and forced himself upon her. As a result of Vasudha's abortion, she was expelled from school. The school informed the local guardian of Vasudha, who was Raghubeer himself.
Abortion was on 14th. Vasudha was suspended on 15th and the same night Mrs Raghubeer and her driver were killed. On 16th Chunni filed a missing report for her father (the driver who was murdered with Mrs. Raghuveer during their fateful car ride back from Kanpur). The case got closed without due investigation.It is revealed that Vasudha killed her uncle because when she confronted him with the truth, he dismissed her claims and insulted her and asked her to kill herself. In a fit of rage, Vasudha she takes out his gun and shoot him point blank. Later, Vasudha takes out her dress cloth and puts it in the Radha's bag. The change of dress cloth is noticed by Jatil in the wedding video while he is surveying the footage for clues. It is also revealed that Mrs Raghuveer had called Pramila to tell her about the fact that her daughter Vasudha was being sexually abused by her husband Raghuveer. After the truth is shared with Pramila, she is shocked but uses the opportunity to bury the truth.Mrs. Raghuveer was originally going to go back to her brother's home but Pramila begs her to come to back Kanpur. Meanwhile, Pramila reaches out in desperation to Munna Raja (the local MLA and friend of the family) and hints at killing Mrs. Raghuveer who in on route back to Kanpur. She is afraid that Mrs. Raghuveer will take them out of their property to avoid any controversy. Pramila uses the opportunity to broker a deal with Raghuveer to get a lion's share of the property transferred on her son Vikram's name so that she is paid for her efforts while nurturing the family. Munna Raja is revealed to have bought Radha from his father for Raghuveer to placate his sexual desires and to leave Vasudha alone (Pramila knew this). After being confronted with the truth, her son Vikram shuns her in disgust. Karuna cries in disbelief. Karan watches. Vasudha is teary eyed and in shock that her mother tried to save her perpetrator. Pramila kills herself to save face. During Pramila's cremation, Vasudha tells Jatil the truth.Jatil goes back to his normal life with his mother who is intent on finding a suitable match for him. He catches up with Radha's train and subtly asks her to spend her life with him, which she shyly accepts."

The Banishing,2020,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7329642/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The Banishing tells the story of the most haunted house in England. In the 1930s, a young reverend, his wife and daughter move into a manor with a horrifying secret. The film opens with a priest, Stanley, murdering his wife and asking the town physician to cover up the crime. Three years later, in 1938, Marianne and her husband Linus, a reverend, have moved into Morley Rectory with their daughter Adelaide, tasked by Bishop Malachi with restoring the town's sagging faith. The couple has a strained relationship due to Linus's belief that having sex for pleasure is a sin, as well as his jealous fear that Marianne will cheat on him. These fears are exacerbated by the appearance of Harry Reed, who tells him about the rectory's past and that Stanley's wife strayed, as the rectory made her grow wanton. Bishop Malachi later tries to make Harry leave, only for the man to claim that Bishop Malachi is using the family to fulfill a secret, evil purpose for his Nazi cohorts. Harry is later beaten by some of Bishop Malachi's associates.Marianne is encouraged to meet with Harry at the urging of her deaf housekeeper Betsy. Harry warns her that her lies of Adelaide being her dead sister's child will weaken her to evil forces, as she actually had the child out of wedlock. Marianne is further warned that the rectory will turn people against one another, so the family should leave for their own safety. Back at the house, Linus also experiences a supernatural vision of Marianne committing adultery. This prompts a jealous argument between him and Marianne once she returns, particularly after he discovers that she has been to see Harry. The following day, Marianne receives a visit from Bishop Malachi after a church service. He reveals his knowledge that Adelaide is actually illegitimate and not Linus's child, as well as that the child had been briefly taken away from her while she was in a mental hospital. He orchestrated the child's return and her meeting with Linus, threatening to use his power to take everything away from her if she were to try to leave Morley Hall.Marianne's relationship with Adelaide grows increasingly sour, as the child has begun to talk to an unseen figure she claims is her real mother. Adelaide then goes missing. Marianne unsuccessfully tries to seek help from a drunk Linus before approaching Harry, who agrees to help her. When they return they find that Betsy has been murdered by the now-possessed Linus who is in a trance. Harry is able to draw him out and explains that Adelaide has been abducted by the spirit of a pregnant woman who was murdered by several monks, as she was carrying their child. He then has Linus perform a ritual to help Marianne retrieve Adelaide and confront the spirits haunting the rectory. Marianne is forced to experience nightmarish visions, some of which are related to her past, during which she proclaims that she is unashamed of what she has done. She manages to find and retrieve Adelaide, promising the murdered woman that they will give her and the unborn child a proper burial. They make good on their promise, however Bishop Malachi is shown at some later point digging up the bodies and delivering them to Nazi officials in Stuttgart."

Valley of the Dead,2020,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10127708/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Months after bloody combats leave behind thousands of dead in the trenches. Jan Lozano, Captain of the Fifth Brigade has fallen prisoner by an opponent's platoon along with a young driver while carrying out a mission that has been entrusted to him. The possibility of dying executed will soon be overtaken when a new unknown enemy arises. Both rival sides must unite and set their mutual hate aside in order to survive. The film starts with scenes of a small village in the Spanish countryside coming together to celebrate the wedding ceremony of two of their own. As the couple and their parents pose for a new family photograph, a long convoy of cars drives into the village, and out steps a Nazi officer whose evil intentions are visible on his face. The officer is offered a glass of local alcohol, which apparently burns his throat as he chokes up, and this causes much laughter among the villagers. The officer immediately orders his men to gun down every single villager and then throw canisters of strange blue-colored smoke into the whole area. As the Nazi army wears protective gas masks, the canisters are thrown toward heaps of Spanish dead bodies.Jan Lozano (Miki Esparbé), a captain of the Spanish army operational in the area, is seen facing the shooting squad before his high-ranking uncle, General Lozano, arrives and stops the punishment act. It is soon revealed that Jan was the captain of an army squad but had been suspended and given the death penalty for head-butting a judge who also happened to have blood ties with the notorious Francisco Franco. It seems that Jan is always up to such strange and reckless behavior, for which his uncle has to often step in and save his neck, but the Spanish general has now lost his patience. In order to get his nephew back on the positive side of the army's opinion, he gives Jan a mission-to deliver a letter inside an envelope to a place named Alarcos. Jan's reaction makes it clear that this is not as simple as it sounds, as Alarcos falls under the Sixth Brigade, which is located on the other side of a stretch of no man's land and enemy territory. Despite Jan's unwillingness to take on the journey because of the many dangers it poses (for he knows he won't possibly be able to return), his uncle explains that the mission is his last chance to avoid the death penalty. Finally, Jan sets out from the Spanish camp along with a young seventeen-year-old boy named Decruz (Manel Llunell), who had been imprisoned for having disobeyed army orders. Since Jan does not know how to drive, Decruz is appointed his driver, and the two head towards their destination in their army jeep.
Jan witnesses a Spanish soldier being loaded into a specially marked German train, led by the same Nazi officer who killed the entire village.On the way, Jan and Decruz are stopped by a barricade of German soldiers, and once they are allowed to pass after negotiations, Jan notices that the Germans are putting fences across the valley. Driving on, the two Spanish men see a plane crashing into the nearby jungle and also see the pilot jump out of the plane and land his parachute into the thick forest. Jan decides to go help the pilot, knowing that he is Italian, who was on the winning Spanish Nationalist side in the Civil War, the side that Jan belongs to. When they finally find the pilot, he seems to have died from the fall, as his legs are missing from his knee, and he hangs from one of the trees with the parachute stuck in it. But before the two men can leave the scene, they are taken hostage by a group of Soviet soldiers, who were trying to make their way out of Spain secretly after losing the Civil War, having represented the Republican side. Jan tries to think of some means to escape the situation, but the dead pilot's body suddenly wakes up and bites one of the Russians to death. The strangeness of the matter heightens when the dead Russian now wakes up, having turned into a zombie, and tries to attack all the people. After shooting the zombie dead, the Soviets take Jan and Decruz to their camp nearby, but the place looks massacred with dead bodies lying around. Very soon, though, all these dead bodies rise from the dead and attack the living men and women, irrespective of the uniforms they wear or which side of the war they represent.Understanding the grave danger of the whole situation, the Soviet squad decided to give Jan and Decruz a chance to survive and fight zombies along with them. Although the Soviet leader, Sargento (Luis Callejo), seems to take this decision easily, some of his comrades, including a young woman named Matacuras (Aura Garrido) and a man named Mecha (Álvaro Cervantes), do not agree with this plan initially. Despite their differences, the soldiers from the opposing camps now move together as a unit and reach a safe-house in the middle of the forest. Here they find another team already inside, and this team includes a Spanish Nationalist lieutenant, Jurel (Jesús Carroza), his sharpshooting private Rafir (referred to as Muslim during most of the film, because of the man's religion), and a nun named Sister Flor (María Botto). These three are also already aware of the zombie situation, and they finally decide to join Jan and Sargento. Together they spend some time safe inside the house, and some of them make personal relations with each other. Jan grows romantically interested in Matacuras, but the woman rejects all advances from him and also from Jurel. Decruz recognizes Mecha as a bike racer he admired in his childhood. Sargento develops a soft corner for Sister Flor, who heals a wound on his arm. Jan also spends time with the envelope, now opened, and the letter inside it, and he unknowingly reveals a secret message on the piece of paper. As he burns a side of the letter, a detailed map of the entire region, a valley, that had been drawn with some invisible ink becomes clear.Deep into the night, Rafir shoots an approaching zombie in the head to kill it, only to realize that there are bigger hordes of them coming towards the house. The entire crew now flees from the safe-house, and Mecha, who has a specialty in bombs and explosives, blows up the house with zombies inside before leaving. Walking through the forest, they see electric fences at places, which seem to have been put up to stop zombies from spreading, and that works too, as a few zombies are stuck on these fences, slowly burning themselves to death. Among these is also Brodsky, a heavy-built man who was part of the Soviet unit before he died and turned into a zombie. As Sargento goes through a dilemma over whether to kill his own comrade but only to relieve him of his suffering, Jan takes action and shoots Brodsky in the head.Jan now tells the rest of the team about his discovery-the map, written in German, suggests that the Nazis knew about zombie hordes coming out of the valley, as they had calculated the time and direction these hordes would take, and had therefore put up fences to stop them. With this information, Jan and the Soviets all suspect that the Nazis had some direct involvement in the matter, and their suspicions are soon confirmed. Traveling through the night, the team reaches the now-desolate village that was earlier shown at the beginning of the ""Valley of the Dead,"" and the bride, who was seen earlier, suddenly crawls out of her hiding place inside the church. She reveals all that had happened-the Nazis opened fire on all the villagers, but she was saved by her husband and had only been shot in the leg. Taking shelter in her hiding spot, she saw the Nazis throw canisters of some gas toward the dead bodies, which made all the bodies turn into zombies and come back to life.While all this happened, the Nazi officer and his guards looked on from the bell tower, laughing at the people they had killed and turned into zombies, aimlessly walking around, killing a few of them as entertainment. It is now clear that the Nazis were experimenting with this new drug they had developed, and one soldier of the Soviet camp, a man referred to as Comisario Politico (Dafnis Balduz) in ""Valley of the Dead,"" finds documents about this experiment. This man had already looked suspicious, as he was earlier seen secretly making a telephone call, most possibly to his Soviet superiors, and now he decides to steal these documents and hand over this new bio-weapon to the Soviets. He soon makes his intentions clear to the rest of the group, but the man is swarmed and killed by a few zombies as they make their way towards the church. Jan and Sargento lead their group out of the village through underground tunnels, but lives are lost in the process. The young bride, who was bitten by a zombie earlier or now in a possible confrontation inside the church, turns into a zombie and is killed off by Matacuras. Sister Flor also reveals that she has been bitten, and decides to stay back inside the tunnel to kill off the zombies and die in the process, much to the grief of Sargento. Rafir is also bitten on his foot, but it is found out that the bite had only pierced his boot and had not reached his skin underneath.With very little time on their hand, Jan tries to convince the group to follow him to Las Aguilas, a Nazi-Spanish Nationalist outpost, where he had seen a train with the same symbols that were seen in the Nazi experiment documents. He claims that the train should be the source of this disaster, and, therefore, would definitely have some antidote to reverse the whole process. As the Soviets absolutely reject the idea of walking into the enemy's camp, Jan says that he just wants to end the plight of the common people, already suffering terribly from the civil war, and also reveals that his own brother is a member of the Republican army, contrary to his allegiance. This personal connection seems to make Jan look at soldiers beyond the uniforms that they wear, and the man now convinces his Soviet companions to follow the plan. Together, they all travel to Las Aguilas, but Jan is denied entry by his uncle, who does not want any prisoners to be let inside, and makes his support for the bio-weapon clear. The general tells Jan that the Nationalists plan to kill off all the common people in the valley, whom they have already turned into zombies, by dropping bombs on them from planes very soon. The Nazi officer earlier seen is also present in the camp, and he kills General Lozano, who wants to delay the bombings to protect his nephew.On the other hand, Decruz reveals that he had been bitten by a zombie earlier, and knowing that he was soon about to turn into one, the young man arms himself with bombs all over his body and walks to the Las Aguilas gates. He gets shot, turns into a zombie, and drops the bomb close to the gates to blow it off and kill off guards in the nearby vicinity, thus carving a way for the rest of the group to enter. Jan, Sargento, and the others now enter a tunnel and see the train they had been looking for, with an army of Nazi guards all around. However, the situation soon turns in their favor, though, when hordes of zombies walk into the tunnel, and the Nazis and the zombies face off with each other.As the group now prepares their next plan of action, Jurel and Mecha leave their companions, saying that they do not want to go to such lengths to serve their profession as soldiers, and would rather escape the place. Jan, Sargento, and Matacuras now make their way through the train coaches, hiding from zombies and Nazis, while Rafir provides cover for them from atop a coach. Rafir, though, is soon seen being pulled down by a zombie, while Jurel and Mecha end up inside a car that is quickly surrounded by zombies. Both of them share stories about their respective wives, who were killed by the opposing armies during the war, and then, realizing that the car was filled with explosives, blow themselves off to kill the large horde of zombies. Jan finally finds the coach he had been looking for and enters it with Matacuras, as Sargento goes over to the engine of the train in order to drive it out of the tunnel outpost.Jan and Matacuras now find the Nazi officer, who reveals that it was all his invention and idea to make such a bio-weapon to kill enemies before the rival Soviet forces could make any of it. When asked about the antidote, the officer reveals that there is actually no antidote for the gas, other than a few things that only slow down the process, and the officer cruelly expresses his pride in making such a weapon. It is clear that he has injected himself with large doses of this drug, intending to turn into a very powerful zombie, but the man is shot dead in the head by Matacuras before he turns. Zombies now enter the coach, and one of them bites Jan in his hand. Certain that he too would turn into a zombie, Matacuras very quickly amputates Jan's hand, which soon turns rancid from the bite's effect. The two then take shelter in a small glass compartment at the end of the coach. Sargento manages to set the train into motion but is surrounded by zombies and shoots himself in the head to ensure he does not turn into one. As the train leaves the tunnel, bombs are dropped by planes, killing all zombies, and Jan and Matacuras share a kiss at the same time.After the whole ordeal is over, the two have survived, protected by the compartment, and so has Rafir, who has managed to kill the attacking zombie and now climbs up on top of the coach. Jan and Matacuras are then seen riding on a motorcycle to a Spanish town, where the woman drops Jan off and prepares to leave. Jan asks her to stay back with him as nobody would recognize her as a Soviet, or at least tell him her real name before leaving, but Matacuras denies both his requests as she rides away on the bike with a smile on her face, and Jan then walks towards the town."

Miller befriends the girls including Astrid (Maria Dragus), Gretel, Beatrix (Franziska Brandmeier), Sigrid (Luisa-Céline Gaffron), Paula (Bianca Nawrath) & Leta (Daria Wolf). Gretel is the clumsy one and is bullied by the other students. Rocholl is very protective of her girls.
When the girls head to the beach for a swim, they find Wheatley's body washed into the shallows.Smith tells Miller that Germany wants to kidnap the girls as then they can have control over the Nazi High command. Miller witnesses that the girls listen to Nazi broadcasts on radio and swear allegiance to Hitler, in presence of Rocholl and Ilse. Rocholl sees Miller and later tells him that she will never let any harm come to the girlsMiller continues to look for clues in a German diplomat's office (when Ilse makes the girls and Rocholl visit the castle for a day out) and finds a list of all German spies in England.
During a party at the castle, Miller overhears a German diplomat tell PT instructor Ilse Keller (Carla Juri), herself a former pupil, of plans to secretly repatriate the students to Germany the very next night. The diplomat also gives Keller a film containing list of all British agents in Germany, to carry with her back to Berlin.
Miller rushes to town to tell Smith the news, but Keller follows him, shoots Smith and frames Miller for it. Now wanted for murder and unable to prove his credentials, Miller attempts to hide from the police.Despite disguising himself as a bandsman in a stolen uniform and joining a parade, he is caught and incarcerated in the local police cells, from which he is extracted by government agents Captain Drey (James D'Arcy) and Corporal Willis (Celyn Jones).
Miller reveals his identity as a British agent to Drey, offering a microfilm stashed at the school as evidence of his role. They take the handcuffed Miller back to the school to recover the film, a copy of Keller's list of British spies in Germany. At the school, Drey is revealed to be a Nazi sympathizer (when he acts under Ilse's orders), but Miller overpowers him and goes on the run again.
Gretel had heard Ilse and Drey discussing plans to extricate the girls that night. It is implied that the plan calls for all the girls to be shot dead, if they cannot be extricated on timeLocal bus driver Charlie (Jim Broadbent) sees him along the road, and drives him to his farm, where, believing his story (Miller says that he is a spy and that he has to stop Ilse exiting the country with the list of British spies in Germany), he uses a hacksaw to remove the cuffs. Miller finds a phone box miles from anywhere, and has just enough time to pass on the code phrase ""Six Minutes to Midnight"" (given to him by Smith before he was shot) to his superiors before Drey and Willis arrive.
Miller, realizing that Willis is unaware of Drey's pro-Nazi sympathies, starts talking. Drey turns and shoots Willis as his cover has been blown; Miller runs for it, and Drey takes his time casually shooting at Miller before sighting for the kill. Before Drey can fire at Miller again, the dying Willis shoots his superior.Miller returns to the school, where headmistress Miss Rocholl (Dame Judi Dench) finds her charges all gone. She was not in the loop on the plan to extricate the girls that night. Miller tells her that Ilse will shoot the girls if her plans fails, to stop them from falling into British plans
They have been led, some reluctantly (as the girls actually want to stay in England and don't identify with their German roots), by Keller to a clifftop where they form two lines to mark out a landing strip as the sun begins to set. A Luftwaffe Junkers Ju-52 arrives and the Madchen light their flares and hold them aloft, but a following RAF Spitfire forces the plane to turn away just as Miller and Rocholl pull up in Willis' car. Keller pulls a gun, intending to shoot all the girls, starting with rebellious student Gretel (Tijan Marei), but Miller, Rocholl and Gretel convince her not to; the girls run to Rocholl, and Keller surrenders to Miller.A few days later, Miller says goodbye to Rocholl in her office at the school, and the girls sing a parting chorus of ""It's a Long Way to Tipperary"". From a radio comes Neville Chamberlain's voice announcing that Britain is at war with Germany."

When he reaches his house after a long journey by road and train, he discovers that his father has died and his last rites have occurred.

Kareem is hostile to Coffee, and purposely directs him to drive a boxing gym where he has discovered Orlando Johnson is hiding out. Johnson and his two lackeys Dee and Rodney (William 'Big Sleeps' Stewart, Andrew Bachelor) have a cop tied up and beaten. He tells them that Coffee tried to molest him and he offers them money to beat him up. The cop pleads with them to let him go, that his boss will come after all of them, and Dee shoots the cop to death. Hearing the gunshots, Coffee goes in, leading to a firefight that Coffee and Kareem manage to flee from, breaking into a trunk of a car to hide.From the trunk, Coffee calls Watts and tells her about Orlando, but Kareem realizes the cop that died was a dirty cop and that they can't trust anyone and forces him to hang up. Kareem also realizes he left his phone when they fled, which had his information and video of the murder - he knows his mom might be in danger. They bang on the trunk until the driver pulls over, and they commandeer the car and drive off. They go to Vanessa's place and pretend nothing is wrong, until Vanessa gets an amber alert for Kareem. They turn on the TV and see the news reporting that Coffee had a psychotic break and kidnapped Kareem. Vanessa calls 911, and refuses to leave just as Johnson and his men arrive. Kareem takes Coffee's taser and tasers Vanessa, shocking Coffee, and Coffee carries her as they flee out the back.They head to a motel, where on the TV, they see Coffee is now also being framed for the dirty cop's murder. Coffee pleads with Kareem to work with him, and Kareem agrees on the condition that Coffee never see Vanessa again and that he take him to strip club, which he reluctantly agrees to. They leave a note for Vanessa explaining everything and track Kareem's phone to where Johnson is. Kareem counsels Coffee that the way not to get bullied is to be aggressive and very gay, like Mike Tyson. Coffee orders Kareem to stay in the car, but he follows him inside the gang's hideout, where the drugs are being produced. Kareem distracts the guards with dirty talk and Coffee knocks them out, one by one. Coffee encounters Johnson and they get into a huge fight, but Kareem gets Johnson at gunpoint.They tie him up, and Coffee tries to interrogate Johnson about the truth behind the drugs and dirty cops. Johnson isn't intimidated by Coffee, but Kareem keeps shit-talking. Finally, Coffee follows Kareem's advice and tells Johnson how he's in love with him - in a more romantic way than Kareem's ""gay and aggressive"" way. Eventually, they realize Kareem's phone is up Johnson's butt. They convince Johnson that the video is the only thing proving he didn't shoot the cop and when they threaten to delete it, Coffee says Watts is the dirty cop running all the drugs. Johnson begs Coffee to protect him - he agrees, and loads Johnson into the trunk of his car. Elsewhere, Dee and Rodney, having been tipped off when the motel clerk called the police, go to Vanessa's motel room to kidnap her.Meanwhile, Coffee calls Hill and tells him to come meet him in secret. He takes Kareem to a strip club, where he tells Kareem how his own stepdad beat him mom and Hill used to come break it up, and that's when he decided to be a cop. He tells him he doesn't really think he could be a good dad anyway, and has no interest in being Kareem's dad. He also talks to Kareem about girls, and pays a stripper to role play a conversation with him. Hill arrives with Watts, and when Coffee pulls a gun on Watts, Hill pulls a gun on him, revealing himself to also be a dirty cop in on the scheme. Watts shoots Hill in the head, planning to also frame Coffee for that as well. Coffee tries to fight, giving Kareem the chance to free, but Watts shoots him in the shoulder. She holds him at gunpoint and demands Kareem show himself or she'll kill Coffee. Kareem arrives driving Watts's cop car and hits her, and he and Coffee drive away.Watts finds Johnson in the trunk and orders him to drive that car to chase after them, leading to a long shootout and car chase. Eventually, Kareem's erratic driving causes Watts and Johnson to crash, giving Coffee and Kareem a chance to get away. They go to the motel room where they discover Vanessa has been taken. Kareem is devastated and begins crying, and Coffee tries to console him. Kareem wants to go after him, but when Coffee tries to stop him, they get into a huge fight that ends with Coffee telling Kareem he's going to dump Vanessa anyway - just as Vanessa walks in. Flashbacks reveal that when Dee and Rodney arrived, Vanessa beat the living hell out of them and tied them up in her car. Vanessa, angry at Coffee for what she heard, takes Kareem and drives off - but Watts's henchmen arrive and kidnap Vanessa and Kareem as Coffee watches helpless.He calls Watts and tells her he's going to trade his life for Vanessa and Kareem. He drives up and demands that Vanessa and Kareem be released and he will turn himself over. When Watts threatens to shoot Kareem right there, Coffee pulls the triggers out of two grenades and begins walking over. Watts tells everyone Coffee is bluffing, and Dee shoots Coffee in the shoulder. He drops the grenades and panics, kicking them towards the drug dealers - one blows Dee to pieces, and much of the drugs are bloodied and burned. The other gives Coffee time to get Vanessa and Kareem and run away, Watts is furious about the drugs she's about to sell being dirtied, and orders Johnson to go after and kill Coffee, Kareem, and Vanessa. When he seems uneasy, she promotes Rodney over him, and Rodney tells Johnson to kill them.Johnson finds them and holds them at gunpoint. Vanessa realizes Johnson is just like Kareem - insecure and acting tough to put a front up, and convinces him not to kill them. Johnson admits he's never shot anyone and really just wanted to be a dentist, and he agrees to help them. The Canadians Watts is selling to arrive, and due to the damage to the drugs, Watts offers him 25 percent off. He accepts, but the Detroit metro police arrive leading to a giant shootout and explosions. Kareem and Vanessa escape to safety, but Coffee gets held up by Watts. During the fight, the briefcase of money gets opened, and Watts scrambles for the money as the building explodes. As Vanessa and Kareem watch in horror, Coffee emerges on fire, extremely badly burned but alive. Rodney escapes with some cocaine, Johnson is made an official informant by the police. Coffee asks Vanessa to marry him, and she jokes she'll have to wait to see how his face heals up. Watts emerges from the fire, still alive, ready to shoot Coffee, but Vanessa grabs his gun and shoots her repeatedly until she does down. Kareem agrees that it's okay for Coffee to keep seeing his mother, and they fist bump.(copied from themoviespoiler)"

Blissfully unaware of their surroundings, they are left to their own devices as the planet falls under attack. Jack (John Reynolds) and Su (Sunita Mani) are a hip Brooklyn couple who, like many of their friends, find themselves dependent on technology and unable to put down their phones. Fearing their mindless scrolling may impact their connection with each other, they seize the chance to head to an isolated cabin in the woods, vowing to unplug from the outside world for a week. Sheltered from texts and push notifications, they are blissfully unaware that the planet is under attack. As strange events unfold, the couple must figure out a way back to civilization-or what's left of it. A prologue states that this was the year the Earth was lost. A 30-something Millennial couple, Su (Sunita Mani) and Jack (John Reynolds), decide to ""disconnect"" from their internet-obsessed and superficial lives in Brooklyn by turning off their phones for a weekend and staying at friend's cabin in the woods. As they drive away, objects begin descending from the sky.At the cabin, the couple reconnect with one another, discussing various ways to ""become better people"", such as by baking bread, going vegetarian, or starting a community garden. During their stay, Jack notices a strange fuzzy ottoman-like object sitting in the den and asks Su if it was there when they arrived, but Su ignores it and attempts to have Jack do several exercises she wrote down from an online list to help them become closer and more motivated as a couple and as adults. This irritates Jack and the two fight, causing Jack to go outside to chop wood. Angry at Jack, Su secretly turns on her phone and listens to several strange voice mails from her mother about ""giant rats"" that consume ethanol infesting New York. Before she can listen further, Jack returns, and Su quickly turns off her phone. Jack admits to Su that he feels inadequate as an adult, but is committed to them becoming closer.The couple make up, but in the morning, they realize the sourdough starter and their whiskey bottles are empty and that the fuzzy ball, which they dub a ""pouffe"", has moved on its own. Realizing the starter and the whiskey contain ethanol, Su recalls her mother's voice mails and admits to Jack that she broke their disconnecting agreement, but that she thinks the voice mails may be related to what's going on. The two hide upstairs and turn on their phones, learning from various belated voice mails and texts that the pouffes are alien invaders that have attacked New York, forcing a mass evacuation, and that the pouffes feed on ethanol.They attempt to attack the pouffe, but it flees using a projectile proboscis. Stunned, the couple then find that their phones have lost signal, and make a plan to escape in their car back to the city in hopes of regaining signal and more information about the alien invasion. However, they find that the pouffes have pierced the car's gas tank to feed on the ethanol-based fuel, and are forced to use the farm's gasoline-tank car, though they struggle to use the stick shift.Driving through the woods, they witness a stranded couple get killed by another pouffe, but throw a bottle of wine off the road as a distraction to lead it away. As they pass, they discover a baby in the stranded car. Deciding that they cannot abandon it, they gather it up, but a woman emerges from the woods and steals their vehicle at gunpoint, stranding them with the baby.With no other options, Su and Jack take the supplies in the abandoned car and head into the woods. Su becomes despondent, worried about her family and lamenting that they have no life skills to survive the invasion, or to offer in any future society in the wake of the discovery of alien life. They encounter a pouffe in the woods and Jack blocks it from attacking Su with his own body as it shoots its proboscis at Jack numerous times. Its proboscis becomes stuck in the baby harness Jack is wearing. Su grabs a knife and cuts off the proboscis, killing the pouffe. Jack finds he is unharmed because his cell phone in his shirt pocket protected his heart.Touched by one another's willingness to save the other, Jack and Su climb to the lookout point along the trail with the baby, and marvel at how they feel more mature and in love compared to how they were when they arrived at the cabin. They commit to marrying one another and intend to raise the baby as their own in the woods, achieving the next steps of their adulthood.Su notices a strange translucent structure growing out of the ground nearby and investigates. She finds it is some sort of force field and Jack examines it as well. The two then discover that their phones have mysteriously regained signal and immediately check them for information. They become so absorbed in the various videos and content on their phones that they fail to realize the force field has enveloped them in a bubble. Unable to break through, they and the baby are carried upwards through the sky. As it climbs higher, the bubble begins releasing oxygen for them. As they break out of the Earth's atmosphere, they notice many other bubbles carrying people like them. Unable to determine what this means, they initially laugh and ask if this means they have been saved, but their faces become uncertain as they float away into space."

When Mzamo allows Nero to speak to his son, Nero tells him that he used to work for an intelligence agency and that name ""Nero"" is actually his cover name; his wife was kidnapped after someone within the agency betrayed him and blown his cover and she killed afterwards. Nero tracked and killed the people responsible for his wife's murder and the agency took him off duty and moved him with son down to Mexico for safety. Nero vows to find the man behind the plot once the given task is accomplished. Through the conversation with Mzamo, it is revealed that Donovan was the one who betrayed Nero and moved him and Taylor to Mexico; due of his combat skills, Donovan had planned to use Nero to eliminate crime to eliminate Mzamo's rival organization.Mzamo gives him a third target which is Omar Chavez - an arms dealer and a personal rival of Mzamo - who is already aware the events of Roja and Garza Cartel and Machado. Nero infiltrates Chavez's estate where he eliminates some of the latter's men but Chavez shoots Nero and destroys the body cam. Presumed that Nero is killed, Mzamo deploys his men to finish them. Nero is interrogated by Chavez, who also shows him the live CCTV footage of his son; Nero explains about his mission for the sake of his son's life and Chavez tells the whereabouts of Taylor. As Chavez about to kill Nero, Mzamo's men arrives and the gunfight erupts between Chavez's men. Nero gains the upper hand, kills Chavez and drives to Mzamo's estate.Certain that Nero is dead, Donovan persuades Mzamo to give him a truck key to kill Taylor by releasing the carbon monoxide into the van, but they discovered that the boy had escaped and Mzamo moved him somewhere else safe, realizing that the agents are planning to kill the boy. Nero arrives at the estate and kills Donovan for the connection of killing his wife. Nero kills the remaining agents while Mzamo and Alanza also kill the agents who turned against them. Mzamo releases Taylor and reunites with Nero. Mzamo makes an agreement with Nero to allow them to live peacefully but the latter is confident that the remnants of the cartel will hunt them down and promises that he will go after Mzamo if he ever see his face again. Nero and Taylor drive away in Mzamo's motorcycle.(copied from Wikipedia)"

Behind You,2020,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7335796/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Two young sisters find that all the mirrors in their estranged aunt's house are covered or hidden. When one of them happens upon a mirror in the basement, she unknowingly releases a malicious demon. The story begins in 1979. Beth is with her boyfriend Charles in her room. Her little sister is wandering the house but Beth is hardly bothered since she's busy with her boyfriend.
The next instant, the sister screams and Beth has to take Charles and look for her sister. They find her in a room, staring at the mirror and pointing.
As soon as they approach her, a pair of hands grab the sister from behind.
Forty years later, two girls are taken to live with their Aunt Beth after their mother has passed away and their father is taking forever to come get them.
The eldest is Olivia and the youngest Claire, who also has a stuffed toy bunny, through which she does her talking because she's traumatized by her mother's death.
Aunt Beth clearly doesn't want the girls at the house and tells them not to go into her study or the basement.
Claire's bunny agrees to follow the rules.
Charles has prepared dinner for the girls and is a much better companion than Aunt Beth who is still frowning at the girls. He's made some weird stew that Olivia eats but Claire doesn't. When she's prodded to eat, she chokes on it because Charles has put peanut butter in the stew.
Olivia stabs her sister's thigh with an EpiPen and saves her life.
That night, Claire is beckoned by voices in the dark and told to do exactly what Aunt Beth forbid her to do. Claire enters the study and finds Aunt Beth Adler after drinking wine. She finds a box in the drawer, retrieves a key and heads to the basement.
Olivia is sleeping peacefully through all this considering a few moments ago she had spotted something weird in the reflection of a mirror covered with paper in the bathroom.
Claire finds the mirrors in the basement and someone begins writing in the dusty mirrors. Claire thinks it's her mother who wants to come back into the living world.
She's told to repeat the words that will open the mirrors and help the spirits come inside. Claire says the rhyme thrice and sees something in the reflection.
The next morning, Claire takes Olivia to the study and shows her a newspaper clipping that Aunt Beth has saved all these years because it is about her being convicted for killing her parents and sister.
Olivia realizes they are in trouble and calls the woman, Camilla, who has taken charge of them. She agrees to come immediately.
Olivia and Claire prepare to run away but the younger girl begins to act weird. Over dinner, she claims she wants to stay in the house and not go with her father. She's also feasting on dinner as if she's never eaten before.
With Beth and Charles exchange uneasy looks. Beth already knows someone has been in her study because the box has been moved.
The two quickly subdue the girls and separate them. Olivia awakens a little later and finds herself locked in a room. She looks out to see that the Camilla has arrived but is being sent away by Charles. Olivia bangs on the window but no one looks up.
Later, Camilla returns and promises to help her out. Olivia confronts Beth and Charles, and Camilla enters with a gun that was in Charles' car. They get Claire even though Beth warns that ""it"" will not want to leave the house.
In the car, Claire cries about leaving her bunny behind. Now that Beth and Charles are locked in a room, Camilla tells Olivia to get the bunny.
Olivia doesn't find the bunny anywhere but comes downstairs to see it by the door.
Olivia goes out and sees bloodstains on the car windows. Camilla has been killed and Claire is nowhere to be found.
Olivia lets out Beth and Charles who reveal that the house is inhabited by an entity that wants to come into the living world. According to Beth, her sister killed her parents so she had to kill her in order to stop the entity from coming out. She says she happily took the blame for the murders but came back to stop the entity once and for all.
Charles is still with her because Beth doesn't take his name during the investigation and he was allowed to live a normal life.
Beth hopes there is another way to stop the entity rather than kill the body it wants to possess.
They try breaking mirrors and use reflections to see the entity once they find out it can be hurt.
That plan goes horribly wrong. Olivia finds Claire laying on a plastic sheet as Beth and Charles are getting ready to murder her.
Olivia argues that Beth never really tries another way to defeat the entity and just likes to murder people. Charles is easily swayed by this speech and decides to help Olivia.
Their plan is to feed Claire peanut butter so that she chokes. Then when the spirit leaves her, they will revive her with an EpiPen. It takes them around three EpiPens before Claire is revived.
Olivia and Claire are getting ready to leave the next day. Charles is glib when he tells them Beth is in a sour mood because she was sure stabbing someone was the only way to defeat the evil.
The girls are about to leave when they find the doors locked. Beth rushes to them and she claims that the entity is now caught between both worlds and can hurt them, which the entity does immediately by stabbing a piece of glass into Charles' throat.
Claire thinks this is her fault and uses the words to get the evil inside her. Beth tells Olivia to stop her sister from doing so.
Beth decides to be a martyr and says the word herself while handing Olivia a shard of the mirror. The entity enters like black smoke and possesses Beth. Olivia stabs her immediately.
The police and ambulance arrive. Olivia is happy to be reunited with her sister. A police officer informs them that this incident would be treated as a murder-suicide. A candle burning inside the now isolated house suddenly blows itself off.(copied from Palvi Sharma's blog - Thanks)"

Bad Tales,2020,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8526370/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A few families living out on a limb in the suburbs of Rome. Tensions here can explode at any time; ultimately it's the children who bring about the collapse. The sweltering summer heat beats down on a sterile residential estate in the suburbs of Rome. Many a family lives here that no longer belongs anywhere. There is a mysterious sense of unease that can explode at any moment. Parents are constantly frustrated because they are not from a better suburb, and the kind of middle-class life they had hoped for is beyond their reach. But their children are the real protagonists of the shock wave that propels the entire estate towards collapse. An almost atavistic rage glimmers in the relationships and events portrayed in the directors' rigorous mise-en-scène. An unreliable narrator guides us, sweetly and sarcastically, through this dark fairy tale. A story about women and men who see their hopes and dreams falling by the wayside all too soon.—Berlinale A dark tale of a community of families living in the southern suburbs of Rome. Families are different, but none of them has a happy child and all children's joys are destroyed or defiled by adults. Quiet sadism of fathers, passivity of mothers and anger of children are woven into one contradictory tangle that leads everyone to disaster.—Bazza the Beast In a small family suburb on the outskirts of Rome, the cheerful heat of summer camouflages a stifling atmosphere of alienation. From a distance, everything seem normal, but it's an illusion - the place hides the subtle sadism of the fathers, the passivity of the mothers and the desperation of the children. This movie is dark and surreal, and supposedly based on the narrative which was found in a young girls discarded diary, the facts of the written daily entries may, or may not be, true ...... Like the entries in the diary, the movie builds momentum in a series of two minute clip-bites which is difficult to synpo .... The story is about a modern looking suburb inhabited by families who have pubescent children varying in ages of around 8 to 13, all of whom are savvy to the adult world thanks to the crass behavior and ""trailer-park-trash"" antics of their parents who routinely swear, cuss, and talk uninhibited adult-talk in front of their children. One sole parent father is so blindly irresponsible, he teaches his 12yo son to drive their beat-up old car, offers him condoms when he know he has a girlfriend ('just-in-case'), and allows him to drink beer. The film focuses on a core group of a handful of children who see the futility of the lives of their parents, and thanks to a deranged school teacher, the children learn how to manufacture two crude and unstable yet seemingly powerful home-made bombs, and how and where to purchase cheap insecticide, which is a potent nervous-system debilitating poison .......... although the bombs are discovered before they are set off, all the background dark undertones eventually hold sway. This dark story ends with the sole-parent father and his son breaking free of their depressing rut, while some of the other children who remain in the suburb take their own lives .... but then the narrator reminds us the bleak events which bring this sad story to a close are based on the words written in a young girls diary .... the facts of which may ... or may-not be ... true"

As the group attempts to turn in for the night, they are knocked out by gas placed by a mysterious figure and Erin, who discovers the gas, is knocked out. The nine awaken and find themselves strapped to suicide bomb vests.The man responsible is Mr. Peterson (Sean Cameron Michael), the group's former science teacher. He confronts the group, as he holds them responsible for the death of his son Caleb, who died of a drug overdose at a party. He sets off various timers on each student's vest and proceeds to kill himself in front of the group. When they find a battered Bobby, who had been separated from the group, it's revealed that he helped Mr. Peterson and was responsible for the group going to the woods. Bobby apologizes, explaining that he was blackmailed by Peterson, but it is too late and the vest explodes, killing him.After Bobby, PJ has the lowest time and begs Rian to help. However, when he is startled by Shay, he accidentally kills her with a high impact blow to the head with his flashlight. He and Rian discover Shay's time has been added to PJ's vest, thus giving him the highest time. Rian tells the group about what had happened and that he got the time because of ""proximity sensors"". When Cici has the next lowest score, she goes insane and goes after the group. When Cici learns Amber had been sleeping with Ezra thanks to Kato telling her, Amber defends herself and kills her best friend. Kato convinces Amber to ally with him to kill the others so they can be the last ones standing.Ezra convinces Erin to team up with him and the two find a man bloodied and tied up in the forest. Erin recognizes him as Detective Miller, Rian's father. Miller tells the two that Peterson forced him to reopen Caleb's case and had strapped him to a vest as well. As he is mortally wounded, Ezra kills Miller, but since Erin is the closest one, she gets his time. Ezra did it as the first selfless act he's done as he has had a reputation as a selfish playboy type. As Erin looks for Rian, Kato, now gone insane, kills Ezra as revenge for Amber. Erin finds Rian and tells her about her father's ordeal.Meanwhile, Kato shoots PJ in the head and then betrays Amber for sleeping with Ezra and chops her repeatedly with an axe. When Rian attempts to turn the vest off, it leads to a sudden death situation between her, Erin, and Kato. Rian then is ready to kill Erin but breaks down and confesses that she is the one who killed Caleb. She admits to slipping ecstasy given to her by Kato at Ezra's party five years ago because he had a higher GPA than her and she was desperate to be valedictorian. She only meant to give him a small dose but gave him too much. She even convinced her father to cover it up. Kato, upon hearing the confession, sneak attacks and kills Rian. However, Rian falls in Erin's arms and thus, she gets the time, which angers Kato.Kato taunts Erin, who has always been the quiet one. However, Erin gains the confidence she desperately needed and incapacitates Kato, who gives his final words as his timer goes off and explodes. Erin's vest glows, revealing a message that reads: ""All your friends are dead! Have a nice life!""A mid-credit scene shows Erin escaping to the road and flagging down a passing car. However, he sees her gun and drives away. Erin screams, and then slowly begins to smile. (thanks to Wikipedia)"

Tanhaji figures out the route to be taken by Uday to reach Kondhana, and lays in siege.This doesn't turn out to be easy as Udaybhan finds himself helped by people who don't want Tanhaji to succeed, resulting in battles and attacks that ensue as the plot unfolds. Chandraji Pisal (Ajinkya Deo) is another commander of Shivaji, who betrays him as he is jealous of Shivaji always favoring Tanhaji. Chandraji sends information to Uday of Tanhaji's position and the town where he intends to commence his attack on Uday's forces.To foil Tanhaji, Uday captures Maratha, disguises them as Mughals and send them through the mountain pass where Tanha's forces are waiting. Tanhaji attacks and realizes late that he is attacking Marathas. Meanwhile Uday transports the cannon through barges on a water route and reaches Kondhana.
Tanhaji realizes that he has been betrayed. He travels to Kondhaba and makes patriotic overtures to the palace guards, who agree to side with Tanhaji against UdayBhan. The palace guards smuggle Tanhaji inside the fort, but he is arrested by Udaybhan's personal guards who torture him. Tanhaji manages to escape with the help of some Rajputana sympathizers who no longer want to support Mughals in conquering India.Tanhaji recoups at his native village. He gathers his strength and army and attacks Kondhana via secret tunnels in the fort that only a few insiders knew about. Gate by gate Tanhaji's elite force ekes out little victories.

But now it's time for the biggest challenge of his life. He must put a crew together and attempt to steal the most infamous video game of all time: the legendary Polybius, the mind-bending arcade game thought to be an urban legend.—Canon y mus Stuart Ashen is introduced as a sneak-thief who steals rare but worthless items, primarily electronics, for historical preservation. His partner, Benny, works with him but is frustrated at not receiving equal credit for their successes. Benny informs Stuart that he has been researching ""Polybius"", the famous lost arcade machine that drove players mad, and has obtained an archive photo of the lead developer - whom Stuart recognizes as Jonathan Ashen, his father. Stuart recalls Jonathan abandoning him and his sister to work full-time on a ""secret project"", telling them that Stuart's grandfather, Woodward, spent his life trying to create a portable organ which did not work, and two coin-shaped tokens which were supposed to grant free play on any arcade machine but in fact shorted out any machine they were put into. Benny has also learned that the Polybius machine may be in the hands of Anthony Agonist, a millionaire businessman with an obsession with the new and modern, and in storage at his facility in the city's Bowthorpe Park Industrial Estate.Stuart visits a professor at the Institute of Outdated Technology who confirms that Polybius is dangerous, especially in the hands of Agonist, and that the developer was obsessed with completing it, even after it become clear it was causing serious harm, until the military blocked the project. Stuart and Benny assemble a team to break into Agonist's facility, consisting of Annalise, a tech fixer; Vocal, a voice actress and impersonator; Jarred, a ""smooth talker"" who can infiltrate the staff; Cube, a tech expert who dislikes Stuart's interest in older tech; Jeff, the financial sponsor; Yiannis, a Greek accidentally recruited by Jeff after misunderstanding Stuart's request for a ""grease man""; and Ryan, the only one with a driving license. Stuart then recruits two more strangers so that there can be 11 team members and sends them out to raise additional funds on the streets.Stuart visits his sister, Christine, who has become obsessed with lawnmowers as a result of their father's last words of advice and is detached from Stuart. She denies knowing anything about Polybius and refuses to co-operate, but it is shown that in fact she is employed by Anthony Agonist to reverse-engineer the game. Agonist is obsessed with the new as a result of having grown up using only old items that were hand-me-downs from his four older brothers, and intends to use the Polybius to create ""Polybius 2.0"", an impossibly addictive mobile app that will also brainwash players with his obsession.Jarred gets a security job at Agonist's facility and installs a hidden camera behind the security desk, but is unable to establish the name of the chief scientist who would have access to the machine. Stuart and the rest of the crew invite Agonist over to Stuart's office with the claim that they are intending to demolish a museum, but actually to obtain Agonist's fingerprint on a water glass; however, Agonist turns up early before Benny can leave with the fingerprint scanner, and refuses the drink of water, but then picks up the scanner and scans his own prints anyway because he likes to play with cool new gadgets. He also mentions to Stuart that his sister is the chief scientist on the project. Christine, meanwhile, becomes suspicious and makes an internal request for the Polybius machine to be moved to a new location, which is intercepted by Cube who informs the crew that they must now complete the heist within two days.Arriving at the facility, Cube and Stuart install a hijacking device in the underground data center and disable the CCTV, explaining that they will only have 30 minutes before it is re-activated. Stuart and Benny approach the desk claiming to be scientists, using the hidden camera's view of the guest list to give the name of an expected visitor, and bypass the inner security measures by using a cast of Agonist's finger and a printed-out photograph of Agonist to bypass a facial scanner (to the fury of Cube who had previously hacked the facial database). Meanwhile, Jarred tries to charm and distract Christine in order to steal the unlocking device for the storage room, but fails to do so until he identifies her obsession with lawnmowers and seduces her by describing the process of starting a ride-on mower.Stuart reaches a door with instructions written in Greek, requiring Yannis to be fetched at short notice to translate. He then bypasses a laser motion detector by moving extremely slowly, disabling it when he reaches the other side, and Cube captures the output from the stolen unlocking device to forward to a device held by Stuart to unlock the storage room. Stuart and Benny are unable to steal the entire upright Polybius cabinet, but Stuart removes the ROM, explaining that all other parts of the machine are standard.Anthony Agonist has intercepted Christine's request to move the Polybius machine and arranges to meet her in the storage room. Expecting to meet Christine, he instead finds Stuart and Benny trying to steal the ROM, but is interrupted when Benny snatches the ROM from Stuart and flees, re-activating the motion detector as he goes. Agonist attempts to chase Stuart while both are moving extremely slowly through the laser movement detectors, but attempts to rush forward when Stuart escapes the grid, activating the security system which subdues him. Stuart and the entire crew are forced to flee the facility as alarms sound all around, but Stuart abandons the crew in fury that he has been betrayed.Christine visits Stuart in his office where she explains that she suspected Stuart was aiming to steal Polybius for reasons to do with their father rather than simply to frustrate Agonist, and he agrees. She explains that she planted a GPS tracker on the ROM in anticipation of it being stolen and Stuart realizes that this can be used to track down Benny. He apologizes to the crew for storming out and they head out to find the ROM.Stuart tracks Benny down, and Benny reveals that due to his frustration at not being given credit for his work, he deliberately manipulated Stuart into stealing the ROM in order that he could betray him and hand it over to his new employer - Jonathan Ashen. Jonathan explains that he left to pursue the project exclusively in order to avoid the same humiliation that Woodward suffered, of giving his life to a work and failing. He has asked Benny to recover the Polybius ROM in order that he could obtain it without being detected by the military, and work independently to complete the project regardless of the danger involved. Jonathan asks Stuart to work with them, but he refuses and is knocked unconscious by Benny.Stuart awakens on a rooftop where Benny and Jonathan have installed the Polybius ROM into an arcade cabinet connected to a power transmitter which will ""test"" Polybius on the screen of every active gaming device for miles around. Christine, who has been in pursuit of Stuart, also arrives and tries to convince Jonathan to stop, but he refuses and starts the machine, throwing gamers in the area into fits. However, Ashens' crew are in hiding and Cube uses his hacking device to jam the transmitter. While Jonathan leaves to try and re-activate the transmitter, Stuart and Christine rush forward and place their grandfather's free-play coins into the cabinet, shorting it out. The crew flees and Stuart attempts to bring his father with them, but he insists on attempting to fix the cabinet and is apparently killed when the cabinet explodes, destroying the ROM.Ashens' crew return to their hideout and celebrate; Cube releases Agonist's dubious financial records publically, resulting in the collapse of his company. The crew also find that of the two strangers recruited to make up the numbers, one has mysteriously died but the other has raised over 100,000 pounds by street fundraising, so they decide to go on a group holiday to Grimsby. Post-credits scenes reveal that Benny is now working at a comic shop being harassed by fans, Agonist is unsuccessfully trying to sell his 4th autobiography at yard sales, and Stuart used some of the money to buy Christine a ticket on a lawnmower-themed cruise event, to which she invites Jarred."

Kalashnikov,2020,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11547520/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Wounded as a tank driver in 1941 during WWII, Kalashnikov sees the latest Soviet machine gun fail. As he's also an inventor, he starts looking for improvements and in 1947 ends up with AK-47 assault rifle. Biographical film about the inventor and designer of small arms Mikhail Timofeevich Kalashnikov. Today it is difficult to find a person who does not know this name. However, not everyone knows what a long and thorny path traveled a self-taught guy to create the legendary AK-47 weapon at the age of 28, which to this day is a symbol of the weapons thought of our time.—Peter-Patrick76 (peter-patrick@mail.com) The film begins with a sequence (supplemented by subsequent flashbacks) in which Mikhail Kalashnikov (Yuri Borisov), a young farmer's son from Altai, is seen secretly working on a functional toy rifle. The film switches to the year 1941, in the midst of World War II, where the now adult senior sergeant Kalashnikov serves as a tank commander in the Red Army. During the Battle of Bryansk, Kalashnikov is seriously wounded while taking out a German anti-tank gun, and he is taken off the front-lines. While being transported to the rear, he and a companion encounter a group of German soldiers, and he witnesses his comrade's new sub-machine gun failing at a critical moment due to design faults in the magazine (the mag got filled with water and when the water froze, it froze the bullets. The spring was too weak to keep all the bullets nicely separated). This inspires him to use his self-acquired talent at inventing to design a new automatic weapon for the Soviet army.On his way home (he was sent home to recover), Kalashnikov visits Matai Station in Kazakhstan, where he previously worked as an engineer but was dismissed for using the depot's workshop to build his private weapon designs. He appeals to his former superior, & the head of the depot Krotov (Sergey Gazarov), to let him assemble his latest invention, but Krotov refuses. When Kalashnikov proposes his design to a passing high-ranking officer named Basarov (Seydulla Moldakhanov), he gets authorization to proceed, and with the help of the workers (Kuzmich (Yuriy Loparyov), Kravchenko (Mikhail Gudoshnikov), uncle Misha (Aleksandr Nikolsky) all of whom work in their spare time) he successfully assembles his new sub-machine gun.While trying to bring it to Basarov at Alma-Ata, he is mistakenly arrested, but an ordnance officer takes notice of the gun's innovative design and has it sent off for evaluation at his workshop led by Andrey Kazakov (Maksim Bityukov). In the testing, the gun works better than all existing models and is super accurate..
As a result, Kalashnikov is released and encouraged to present his gun to Major general Pavel Kurbatkin (Vitaly Khaev), the district commander of Central Asia, who approves him for a national arms design competition. to be approved for national service, the gun has to win at the competition.Kalashnikov is sent to Golutvin, the Shchurov arms testing facility, where he is to compete against prestigious arms designers like Major Alexey Sudayev (Dmitry Bogdan) and Sergei Korovin; there he also meets Ekaterina 'Katya' Moiseyeva (Olga Lerman), a female design assistant and his future wife. Kalashnikov is ordered to work with engineer Captain Vasily Lyutyy (Artur Smolyaninov) to further improve his weapons design. Kalashnikov is uneducated and needs a lot of help to produce detailed engineering drawing for this weapon. Katya is assigned to work with him. Katya is cold at first, but starts to like Kalashnikov when he gives her space and treats her with respect that she demands.
While his weapon ultimately loses to Sudayev's gun, he is given permission to work on new designs, and his friends also encourage him to continue his work on a light machine gun. By 1944, Kalashnikov has the first prototype ready with the help of BasarovHe is asked to go with state security Captain Lobov (Aleksey Vertkov) back to Golutvin for testing and to take part in the competition.. At the railway station Kalashnikov is hailed by his brother, who is a convict and headed for the gulag. Kalashnikov appears to ignore him, but Lobov sees this. He confronts Kalashnikov later for being an enemy of the state. Kalashnikov fights back and tells Lobov that his father gave up their farm for the socialist cause, and he hasn't seen his brother in 8 yrs.
Kalashnikov is reunited with Katya. They sleep together. Kalashnikov's design performs well in testing, but none of the designs win as they are too complex for mass production. He is offered a chance to continue to work to improve upon it.
Colonel Glukhov (Anatoly Lobotsky) likes Kalshnikov's approach and asks him to stay at Golutvin to complete his improvements. Kalashnikov marries Katya.The war comes to an end and Kalashnikov is worried that his work will count for nothing. Glukhov assign a new department to Kalashnikov and asks him to continue working on his assault rifle design. In quick time (with the help of Sudyev, who has also returned from the war), Kalashnikov has a new automatic rifle ready and is sent to the Kovrov Arms Factory in 1947 to improve on it. Kalashnikov knows that Kovrov is run by Degtyaryov, who is a competitor for the new rifle design competition. He doesn't hope to get a fair chance..
Impatient to see if it works, and denied a test at the firing range, he conducts his own successful trial, upon which he is arrested for testing his gun in the open without authorization and brought to General Vasily Degtyaryov (Valery Barinov), a notable arms designer whom Kalashnikov considers his fiercest competitor. However, Degtyaryov, expressing his sincere respect for Kalashnikov's talent and the superiority of his design, removes himself from the competition, and tested under extreme conditions (after being immersed in water and sand), the new rifle passes.In 1949, after the first major field testing, the new weapon is approved for mass production. Kalashnikov is decorated with the Stalin prize and given an extended leave of absence, which he uses to visit his mother at his home farm along with his wife and children.
Over 200 MM Ak-47s were produced and the gun is still in service."

Kouichi ""Yui"" Sakura or known by his nickname, ""Cherry"" (an English translation of his surname) is a shy boy who has trouble communicating with people. He only writes haiku poems to express his feelings. Yuki, named online as ""Smile"", also has the same problem as Cherry. She is obsessed with being an online influencer. Both of them go to the large shopping mall named ""Oda Nouvelle Mall"" in their town. Cherry supervises the elderly Mr. Fujiyama, who has been looking at an album with a beautiful girl next to a radio station on it titled ""YAMAZAKURA"", reads several haiku around outside of the mall. Cherry tries to catch Mr. Fujiyama's attention and they go to the mall. Meanwhile, in the mall, Yuki starts doing online videos of herself with cute things happening at the mall. A boy named Japan gets scammed by the gacha machine with a fake Hikarun figurine and throws a tantrum about it. His partner Beaver steals the cutout of Hikarun in order to please Japan but ends up attracting the attention of the security guards and Motopuri, the mall's manager. Motopuri pursues Beaver while he causes chaos throughout the mall. He bumps into Cherry and Yuki, who both end up switching up their smartphones. As Cherry and Yuki get back up, her mask accidentally falls off, exposing her braces to Cherry, who cluelessly eavesdrops on her and says ""Braces"". She runs away from him and storms out of the mall, embarrassed. Beaver ends up severing the head of the Hikarun cutout in the process before Motopuri tries to subdue him.Cherry and Mr. Fujiyama return to a place the former works at, a care center for the elderly in the mall. Mr. Fujiyama is asked by workers there whether he found the record for the album he keeps looking at but walks away, indicating that he never found it. Mr. Fujiyama angrily recites a haiku he managed to memorize while going to the mall at Cherry, but later says it calmly at Cherry's urging. They both talk about the intricateness of haikus. When Cherry tries to convince Mr. Fujiyama to keep his voice down, Mr. Fujiyama raises his voice again while pretending not to hear what Cherry said. Mr. Fujiyama is later picked up by his grandson, Toughboy, who was hunting down Beaver for vandalizing on his car. Toughboy calms down when he sees Mr. Fujiyama, who he calls ""Akiko-san"" but gets angry and blames Cherry for the vandalism when the latter tries to read what the graffiti says. Cherry denies any wrongdoing and Toughboy leaves with Mr. Fujiyama. Toughboy later tells Cherry that he should tell Beaver that he'll beat him up whenever he shows up.After his shift at the caring center, Cherry sees another graffiti, but it was a haiku instead of a catchphrase. Yuki, walking back home while on a path next to a rice field, rants about Cherry saying ""braces"" to her until realizing that her mask was gone. Yuki checks her smartphone only to see that it had a dictionary in it, and wonders who owns this phone, later realizing that she accidentally switched it with Cherry back at the mall. She worries about what happened to her lost phone and frantically continues running back home.Cherry climbs to the top of one of the mall's parking structure elevator shafts from the roof deck of the parking structure and finds a graffiti-ridden den belonging to a boy named Japan. Beaver tries to cheer him up with the now-severed head of the Hikarun cutout, impersonating her, as he got a fake Hikarun gacha toy back in the mall. But Japan ends the deal and gets angry with him for not bringing the cutout back intact. Beaver apologizes to Cherry for what happened earlier and Cherry tells Beaver that Toughboy was looking for him. Cherry later corrects Beaver, who is revealed to be subpar at writing Japanese because he wrote ""hear"" instead ""here"" in Japanese on the car. But Beaver insists so while Cherry ignores him.Yuki returns home and asks her sisters Marie and Julie to help her look for her phone. Back at the mall, Beaver continues writing haikus on the floor of their den. The haikus were revealed to have been made by Cherry. Beaver tells Japan that he is using Cherry's haikus to learn Japanese. But Japan tells Beaver that he speaks it just fine, the only problem he had was writing it. He also states his father can only write in Spanish. Cherry tells Beaver that he is tagging all of his own haikus all over the mall. Beaver also said to him that he also tagged more of his haikus on the apartment building. Cherry tells him to stop tagging property as he calls it embarrassing. But Beaver says to him that his rhymes sounded cool. Cherry later corrects him that they are haikus, not rhymes. Cherry tries to make a haiku out of his mouth while watching the evening sunset. Cherry pulls out his phone only to realize that he also switched it with someone else. That someone else was Yuki, the girl with braces he saw back at the mall. Meanwhile, back at Yuki's house Marie locates where Yuki's phone is on her computer. Yuki continues worrying about her phone, saying that she'll die. The location of the phone is finally found by Marie, located back in the mall. Yuki returns to the mall to pick up her phone. Julie tells her to call back instead so Yuki stays home. Beaver asks Cherry if he grabbed the wrong phone. Cherry tells Beaver he got the wrong phone when they ran into each other. Suddenly, Cherry gets a call from Yuki's phone, from Yuki's sister Julie. Cherry, indecisive, is told by Japan to pick up the call, but Cherry still couldn't pick up the call. Beaver ends up answering it for him. Yuki is the one talking on the phone. She tries talking to them, but they won't talk at all. Cherry, nervous to talk to another person, accidentally ends up starting a video call with them. Yuki is embarrassed again since she lacks her mask and puts one on to cover her buckteeth, but the camera was off the whole time until Marie turns it on. Both Yuki and Cherry see each other on the phone, but Japan interrupts their conversation by saying the online catchphrase of Yuki's alter-ego Smile, revealing that he is a Smile fan as well. Julie abruptly hangs up the call due to embarrassment. Julie wonders what was that while Marie finds out that the person who blocked the camera was one of their viewers. Julie says that the boy was too intense for her taste. Back at the mall, Japan screams with excitement that he talked with Smile on their call. Beaver asks who is Smile, and Japan replies that she is a famous high-school online influencer. Japan asks Cherry if he knows her, only for Cherry to reply with a no. Japan shouts at Cherry for missing out and yells that Smile has accumulated a million views on an online video app. Yuki calls Cherry again one more time, only for Cherry to get shy and nervous again. Cherry apologizes that what Japan said wasn't directed at her and apologizes sheepishly.The next day, Yuki returns to the mall with her sisters for dessert and get her phone back. The way Yuki eats in public, is that she covers her mouth to avoid showing her buckteeth. The sisters are puzzled. They ask why she is eating like that and ask whether it is a trend or not. Yuki tells them to mind their own business. Meanwhile, Cherry handles a poetry inspiration activity for the elderly with Ms. Miyuki. The workers clean up the care center while they are away. With the Obon break ending soon, the care center is forced to find a new part-timer to have at least four workers since Cherry will no longer work there starting on the 17th of August, the day of the Obon festival and end of the Obon break, leaving the care center with only three workers on the job by that day. The boss of the care center is worried when she sees this on the shift schedule. Meanwhile, the elderly in the poetry inspiration activity go around the mall to get inspiration for writing poems. Mr. Fujiyama, meanwhile, is standing on the roof deck of the parking structure still holding on to that same album. Julie, meanwhile, asks if Yuki being seen with fans is bad. Marie replies that she can become a ""mecha girl"" because it's popular but Yuki says no. Cut to a flashback of Yuki, her parents, and her sisters doing online videos at such a young age, Julie says her buck teeth was always her best feature since she was young. Yuki agrees reluctantly. Marie says it's cute, and the viewers loved it as well. Marie says her smile looks like a beaver but she says she isn't one. Julie's if she really liked her ""beaver smile"". Yuki agrees but adds a reason for getting embarrassed with it. Cut to another flashback, Yuki looks into the mirror now analyzing her buck teeth then frantically searches for disposable face masks to cover her buckteeth. Yuki later replies that her buckteeth is no longer cute anymore for her age. Julie calls her a teenager for saying that. Marie asks if she also hates her braces as well. Yuki agrees. Marie calls them cute and totally ""mecha"". Julie says that she understands that she hates how she looks after waking one morning. Marie asks Julie if it has happened to her as well. She replies yes. Cherry continues supervising the elderly across the mall until he stops and Yuki looks at him, with the sisters surprised seeing the guy who was on their call in-person. Yuki and her sisters wonder what he is doing with Ms. Miyuki, mistakenly saying that he is into more mature types. Then Julie assumes he has a girlfriend despite looking unsociable. Julie also assumes they are siblings but Marie says that they don't look related at all. Yuki runs toward Cherry, with her two sisters giggling about it. Cherry, sends a written haiku online and scrolls over other people's comments. His comment gets a like from a person named ""Maria"", and he gets twitchy. Ms. Miyuki asks the elderly to present the haiku they have written. Yuki and her two sisters are eavesdropping on the activity. Julie thinks Ms. Miyuki is a teacher and Marie wonders what are they doing. Mr. Fujiyama, gazes at the eavesdropping Yuki and her sisters, but he goes back to writing his haiku before submitting it to Ms. Miyuki, who would recite the poems. When Ms. Miyuki proceeds to the next poem, she calls Cherry, as it is his haiku. Unbeknownst to Cherry, Ms. Miyuki had the paper strip upside-down and tells Cherry to recite his own haiku for them. Cherry is shocked. Ms. Miyuki interprets his reaction as a no but Cherry replies nervously that reading in front of people is not really his style since he is shy. Ms. Miyuki encourages him and he turns red when all of the elderly agree, sighing. Ms. Miyuki encourages him to read his haiku to him with his wonderful voice. Cherry looks toward Mr. Fujiyama and gulps. Cherry tries his best read his haiku as much as he can. The elderly people couldn't really listen. Ms. Miyuki encourages Cherry to say it a bit louder. Cherry struggles until he takes a deep breath and reads his own haiku at a tone which the elderly people can finally hear him. They applaud him for trying his best. Meanwhile, Yuki and her two sisters are still eavesdropping on Cherry. Cherry says to the elderly that haiku is a written art form, meaning it doesn't have to be read aloud. Ms. Miyuki agrees. Ms. Miyuki says that some scenes can only be conveyed when read aloud. Cherry replies that it still gets across even without being read aloud. Suddenly, Mr. Fujiyama yells another haiku, much to the surprise of the others and refers to the girl in the mask who is eavesdropping on them then repeats it in a calm voice. The girls suddenly start panicking and Cherry gazes at them before they calm down.Outside the mall, Cherry and Yuki walk home together on the path next to the rice field with Yuki asking whether he is a year older than her. Cherry replies thinking that he, himself is a year older than her. Yuki finally sees why he is named Cherry, as in cherry blossoms translated from their Japanese word, ""sakura"". He replies, thinking Cherry is a cute name. Yuki doesn't know whether to call him Mr. Cherry or just Cherry. Yuki asks what he is listening to. Cherry, surprised, replies by saying he's always disliked loud sounds, and is not actually listening to anything, using the headphones as an improvised earplug to get past people who want to talk to him. Yuki is impressed by how ingenious he is regarding his shyness. They continue walking and Cherry starts another conversation with Yuki asking why is there a dictionary attached to his phone. Cherry says it is a saijiki, a dictionary used for writing haikus. He also says there is an app version as well but he says he prefers the book more. He also says haikus help him express things in words better. He also says that he is no good at reading in front of other people. He also says he sometimes uploads his own haikus online. Yuki replies that it all makes sense to her that his haikus will be looked at more. Cherry continues scrolling over his haikus that were uploaded online, having lesser followers than Smile herself. When Cherry presses the number of his followers he sees Japan and Beaver, who was revealed to be fluent in the Spanish language, and ""Maria"", who likes cute things. Depressed at having not a lot of friends, he is disappointed that not many people read his haikus. Yuki asks whether they comes out easily with Cherry replying that they mostly come out on good days. Yuki tells Cherry to make a haiku now but Cherry is somewhat shocked that he has to write another one. Yuki apologizes that she was a being a little too pushy when she said that. With night falling upon them, Cherry writes another haiku inspired by the lights that have already lit up. Though Cherry is quite reluctant to continue, he continues with the sunset he saw yesterday. He turns red with nervousness and flinches. Yuki later recites the haiku, relieving Cherry. She asks about the meaning of the first stanza, of lights in the summer night. Cherry replies that it is about lights and that it is a summer kigo, meaning seasonal word. Reciting the haiku again, Yuki calls it cute, much to Cherry's surprise. She also says that a part of the haiku and his voice is cute. Cherry takes off his headphones and questions Yuki about his voice. Yuki replies that it is cute as well, for no reason whatsoever. Cherry, in his apartment, wonders about what Yuki meant when she called his voice cute.Cherry continues scrolling over his phone then leaves it on his bed to show the haiku Yuki requested for. He stands up and roams around his room, and takes a folded moving box, a toolbox, and his daruma and starts packing up long before the day he'll move out. Cherry's mom is cooking for dinner and hurts her back when she tries to reach for something. Her husband returns home. Cherry asks his dad whether he can put the box over there, and his dad agrees. The dad questions if it is little too early to start packing, saying that they'll not be moving until next month. The mom says they are better off packing early rather than running around last-minute anyway. The dad asks his wife how's her back, with the wife replying that it still hurts a bit. The husband tells her not to push herself because he'll help with the chores anyway, much to the wife's relief."

Anurag Kashyap and Anil Kapoor haven't worked together since their shelved film Allwyn Kalicharan in 2003. They get into a tiff at a talk show when Anurag spills water on Anil's face in front of the whole media. Laer, Anurag decides to apologize to Anil, and on his birthday he visits his film set and tries to convince him to take the lead role in his new film.

One day, Kashyap and Anil Kapoor are interviewed on a variety show. After an audience member asks if the director or the actor is more important, they start arguing about the question and insulting each other's careers, eventually culminating in Kashyap throwing a glass of water in Kapoor's face. This becomes a major scandal for Kashyap and causes actors to back out of his projects. As he sits in his bedroom enraged, Yogita says that she has an idea.Later, on Christmas Eve and Kapoor's birthday, Kashyap goes to his set along with Yogita (whose camera the audience is seeing from) and tries to pitch him a new story about a mad director who kidnaps the daughter of an aging actor, who has to find her. Kapoor is not interested at first, but realizes that his daughter, Sonam, has actually been kidnapped by Kashyap, who wants to capture his real actions and emotions. Kashyap tells him the rules: he has ten hours (until sunrise the next day) to find her, he can't get the police or anyone else involved, all calls he makes must be on speakerphone, and that Yogita's camera must always be recording.Kapoor first tries going to the police, but Kashyap and Yogita catch up and convince them it is just a rehearsal for their film.

After talking to his son Harshvardhan, Kapoor finds out through her driver that she was last seen at the hotel Crescent. At the hotel, he bribes the manager with an endorsement to access the CCTV footage, where the driver of the taxi used was captured. He searches for him on the streets of Mumbai with little success.

After spotting him through the camera's viewfinder finding him, Kapoor chases him through and around Mumbai Central but is hit by a car and loses him. At the Christmas celebration, Kapoor has to dance for the crowd until someone tells him where Javed lives, and Kapoor finally catches up to him.Javed directs them to where he was told to take Sonam, but Kashyap begins to insist that the place he is talking about was not the one in the script. The place turns out to be Kashyap's house, and another call confirms that Sonam has been held in his DVD room. When they get there, not only is Sonam gone, but Kashyap's parents have also been kidnapped. After a struggle between the trio, Kashyap reveals the original site he had planned and they rush to it as time runs out. A mysterious second cameraman shows up, but they don't find any of the kidnapped. Although Kashyap repeatedly insists that the plan has not been going according to his script, Kapoor discovers a copy and forces him to read it, which supposedly reveals that Kashyap intentionally diverted him and was going to force Kapoor tho choose between shooting himself or Kashyap with a gun in his bag. As Kapoor interrogates an increasing agitated Kashyap, he accidentally shoots him.The perspective shifts to a neutral POV as they take Kashyap to the hospital. Sonam and Kashyap's parents were actually found in the basement of Kashyap's home, and Kashyap is to be convicted for their kidnapping. As he lays in the hospital bed, Kapoor reveals that the whole film was his own plan all along: he convinced Yogita to help frame Kashyap in exchange for an opportunity to break into the industry, arranged the flow of events, and involved his family in the act. Months later, the resulting film wins Yogita, credited as the director, and Kapoor awards at the Filmfare ceremony, while Kashyap, now in a mental asylum, is seen to be in a deranged state plotting vengeance."

The Players,2020,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10168672/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"From campy lies to sexy surprises, this collection of vignettes captures the follies of several men as they fumble with fidelity and relationships. Bickering spouses make their way from taxi to airport to plane to the sky on their way to the Maldives for vacation. She's full of accusations, he's (Massimiliano Gallo) full of excuses, and it's not until he's asleep during the flight that she looks at his phone and screams, right over the beginning of the credits sequence. The next mini-film is relatively heavy drama, and plays out during one late night, with Mastandrea playing a husband whose wife (Valentina Cervi) pries and pries and pries until he spills every detail about an affair he had. In another short, Scamarcio is a salesman on the road, in a hotel for a conference; he thinks he's suave, tells jokes that make the listeners feel as if they're in prison, and hits on anything that moves. He eventually ends up in a co-worker's room, desperately cajoling her to sleep with him. He's very grabby which is very ""funny"" (read: not funny) and a laughingstock among the other salespeople - Mastandrea is one of them, who actually succeeds with the ladies - but he either isn't aware or doesn't care. The next short stars Mastandrea as a sad bald man who routinely visits the glory hole at a local brothel - yes, until his wife (Marina Fois) begins to suspect something's up. I think that one's supposed to be funny, because it has a punchline. Another finds Mastandrea playing a cad-and-three-quarters who gaslights the living shit out of his poor wife (Laura Chiatti) when she tries to nail him down. Like, he has her committed. Comedy. And finally, in the last bit, Mastandrea, Scamarcio and Gallo play three pals at a fancy restaurant talking about which women in the room they'd sleep with.—John Serba - Decider"
